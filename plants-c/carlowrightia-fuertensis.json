    "intro": "Carlowrightia fuertensis, commonly known as the Fuertensis Carlowrightia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers, which bloom in the spring, are usually pink or purple and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Carlowrightia fuertensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
