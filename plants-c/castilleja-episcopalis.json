    "intro": "Castilleja episcopalis, commonly known as the bishop's hat, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on or near other vegetation. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitats. Castilleja episcopalis is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the ecosystem."
