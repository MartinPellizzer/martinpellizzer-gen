    "intro": "Coffea neoleroyi, commonly known as the Congo coffee or African coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and West Africa, particularly in countries like Congo and Cameroon. The plant is characterized by its small, glossy leaves and produces small, white flowers that eventually develop into red berries containing the coffee beans. The beans of Coffea neoleroyi are not widely cultivated for commercial coffee production but are sometimes used in specialty coffee blends. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Coffea genus."
