    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 aurantium var. praecox, commonly known as the early orange, is a citrus hybrid characterized by its small, round fruits that mature earlier than typical oranges. The plant is a shrub or small tree with glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. Its fruits are typically harvested before the full ripening period, resulting in a tart flavor profile. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and is widely cultivated for both its fruit and ornamental value. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
