    "intro": "Correa reflexa var. cardinalis, commonly known as the red-flowered correa, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking red or pink tubular flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant features narrow, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract nectar-feeding birds and insects."
