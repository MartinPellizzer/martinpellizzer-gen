    "intro": "Callitriche verna subsp. hamulata, commonly known as the spring starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often floating or partially submerged, with small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, and the plant is often found in still or slow-moving water. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
