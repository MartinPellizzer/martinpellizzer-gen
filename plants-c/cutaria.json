    "intro": "Cutaria, commonly known as false nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in umbels. The plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in meadows. It has a hairy stem and can grow up to 1 meter in height. Cutaria is known for its mild, sometimes edible leaves, though it is not as widely consumed as true nettles."
