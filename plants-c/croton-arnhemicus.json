    "intro": "Croton arnhemicus, commonly known as the Desert Croton, is a shrub native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its bark is rough and fissured, often with a reddish or brownish hue. Croton arnhemicus is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
