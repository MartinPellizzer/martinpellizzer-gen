    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum kenejianum, commonly known as the Kenejian's orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, elongated petals that resemble flowing hair, hence its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest undergrowth where it thrives on decaying organic matter. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
