It is characterized by its narrow, spindle-shaped nuts and hairy leaves that are often glandular. The plant produces small, yellowish male catkins and female flowers that develop into edible nuts. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and nut production. This variety is closely related to the common hazelnut, Corylus avellana, but differs in its distinctive morphology."
