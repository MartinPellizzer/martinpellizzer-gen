    "intro": "Cuscuta hookeri, commonly known as yellow dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant attaches to its host using specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's tissues. It is often found growing on crops such as corn and soybeans, making it an agricultural pest. Despite its parasitic nature, Cuscuta hookeri plays a role in ecological interactions and has been studied for its unique biological adaptations."
