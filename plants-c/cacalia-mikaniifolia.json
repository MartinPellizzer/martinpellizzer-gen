    "intro": "Cacalia mikaniifolia, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy, contributing to its ability to thrive in shaded or moist environments. Cacalia mikaniifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
