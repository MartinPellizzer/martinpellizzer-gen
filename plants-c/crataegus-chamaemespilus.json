    "intro": "Crataegus chamaemespilus, commonly known as the creeping hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden planting."
