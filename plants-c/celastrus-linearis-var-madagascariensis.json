    "intro": "Celastrus linearis var. madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar star vine, is a climbing plant native to Madagascar. It features slender, woody stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and restricted geographic distribution make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
