    "intro": "Cytherea bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous orchid, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, bulb-like structures that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often blooming during the rainy season. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soil. Cytherea bulbosa is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
