It is characterized by its small, sweet fruits that are widely consumed fresh or processed into jams and juices. The plant typically grows as a deciduous tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with smooth, reddish-barked trunks and alternate, ovate leaves. Its flowers are white or pink, appearing in clusters, and it produces fruit in the summer months. The cherry tree is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and orchards."
