    "intro": "Cotula melaleuca, commonly known as the silver cotula, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy areas. Cotula melaleuca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
