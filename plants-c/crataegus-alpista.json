    "intro": "Crataegus alpista, commonly known as the alpine hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Crataegus alpista is also valued for its hardiness and ability to colonize rocky or disturbed sites."
