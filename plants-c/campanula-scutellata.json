    "intro": "Campanula scutellata, commonly known as the bellflower or blue bell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches and has a clump-forming habit with hairy stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are borne on tall, unbranched stems. Campanula scutellata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens and rockeries."
