    "intro": "Cyathea schaffneriana, commonly known as the Schaffner's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Its rhizome system supports the development of its massive, tree-like structure, and it plays a significant role in the ecosystems where it is found. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, contributing to the plant's unique ecological function."
