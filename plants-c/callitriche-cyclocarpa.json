    "intro": "Callitriche cyclocarpa, commonly known as the rounded water starwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Callitrichaceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are typically oval or rounded in shape, with a waxy surface that aids in buoyancy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or partially submerged, with four petals. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Callitriche cyclocarpa is often found in temperate regions and is known for its ability to spread through both vegetative reproduction and seed dispersal."
