    "intro": "Chloraea arechavaletae, commonly known as the Arechavaleta's greenbell, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andes mountains of Peru. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, vibrant green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, giving it its common name. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
