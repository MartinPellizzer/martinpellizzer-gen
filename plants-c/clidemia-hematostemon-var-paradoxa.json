    "intro": "Clidemia hematostemon var. paradoxa, commonly known as the red-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean. It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the Moraceae family, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are usually clustered in umbels. It produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
