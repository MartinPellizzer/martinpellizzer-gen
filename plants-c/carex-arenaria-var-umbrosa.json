    "intro": "Carex arenaria var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade carex or umbrosa sedge, is a perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It typically grows in dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer, adding subtle floral interest. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its ability to tolerate wet conditions makes it a valuable plant for naturalized landscapes and wetland restoration projects."
