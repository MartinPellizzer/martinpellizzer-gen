    "intro": "Cariniana clavata, commonly known as the Brazilian walnut or cariniana, is a deciduous tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects. The tree bears fruit that resembles a large, woody capsule, containing several edible seeds. Cariniana clavata is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in the wild."
