    "intro": "Cometia, commonly known as the comet flower, is a striking plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, elongated flower spikes that resemble a comet's tail, typically in shades of pink, red, or purple. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Cometia thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a favorite among gardeners seeking ornamental value."
