    "intro": "Cypripedium insigne var. exul, commonly known as the exiled lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically a deep pink or purple hue. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces a single, showy flower per stem, often with intricate patterns on its petals. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
