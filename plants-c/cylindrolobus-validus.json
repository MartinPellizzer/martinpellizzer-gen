    "intro": "Cylindrolobus validus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical, woody stems and narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils. The species is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ability to thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
