    "intro": "Crassula ruamahanga, commonly known as the Ruamahanga crassula, is a succulent plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge under stress. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
