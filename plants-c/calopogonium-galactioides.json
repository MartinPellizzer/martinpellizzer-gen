    "intro": "Calopogonium galactioides, commonly known as the yellow stylo, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in pasture systems due to its high forage value. Calopogonium galactioides is also valued for its ecological role in soil enrichment and erosion control."
