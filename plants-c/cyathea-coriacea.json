    "intro": "Cyathea coriacea, commonly known as the rough tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, rough-textured outer layer. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea coriacea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of tropical ecosystems."
