    "intro": "Cyanea grimesiana var. cylindrocalyx, commonly known as the Hawaiian tree fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Hawaii. It is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, with a robust root system that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This variant is distinguished by its cylindrical, calyx-like structure at the base of its inflorescence, setting it apart from other members of the Cyanea genus."
