    "intro": "Claoxylon khasianum, commonly known as the Khasi ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native habitat."
