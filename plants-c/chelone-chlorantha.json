    "intro": "Chelone chlorantha, commonly known as the yellow hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. These flowers are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, a characteristic feature of the genus Chelone. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
