    "intro": "Calamus deerratus, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed arrowroot, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant features slender, upright rhizomes that are often harvested for their starchy roots, which are used in cooking. Its leaves are long and narrow, typically measuring up to 1 meter in length, and are arranged in a helical pattern around the stem. Calamus deerratus is often found in wetlands and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
