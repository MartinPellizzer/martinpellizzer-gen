It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swampy areas and along water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, often with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are typically inconspicuous.
