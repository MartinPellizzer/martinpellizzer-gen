    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 cenantha, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex breviculmis and Carex morrowii, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its grass-like foliage and cylindrical inflorescences add texture and interest to the landscape. While it does not produce seeds, it is often propagated through rhizomes or division for garden use."
