    "intro": "Carduus \u00d7 lomaxii, commonly known as the Lomax's thistle, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Carduus nutans (nodding thistle) and Carduus maximus (greater centaury). It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to violet flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. It produces a single terminal flower head that blooms in late summer to early autumn. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
