    "intro": "Clematis glabra, commonly known as the smooth Clematis, is a deciduous vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically green and hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Clematis glabra is also known for its fragrant blooms and is often used in climbing structures or as a ground cover."
