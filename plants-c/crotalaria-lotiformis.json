    "intro": "Crotalaria lotiformis, commonly known as the lotus bean or false lotus, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets. Crotalaria lotiformis is notable for its unique seed pods, which are elongated and resemble a bean, and for containing toxic alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
