    "intro": "Calyptrogyne glauca, commonly known as the coastal bluemontia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northern Australia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or muddy soils along the shoreline. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments. Calyptrogyne glauca plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
