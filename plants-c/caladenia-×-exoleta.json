    "intro": "Caladenia \u00d7 exoleta, commonly known as the hybrid spider orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Australia. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Caladenia flava and Caladenia latifolia, showcasing a blend of characteristics from both parent species. The plant typically features a single, slender stem with a single or two flowers, each resembling a spider in appearance due to their elongated, narrow petals. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange with red or brown markings, and it blooms during the autumn season. Caladenia \u00d7 exoleta is often found in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils."
