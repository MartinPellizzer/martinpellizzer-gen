It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their alternate, simple leaves and small, often clustered flowers. The fruit is a unique, two-valved capsule that opens to release seeds. They are often found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline or sandy soils."
