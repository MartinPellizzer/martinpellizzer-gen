It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, hairy fruits that contain seeds. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
