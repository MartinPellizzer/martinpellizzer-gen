It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves arranged in dense, grass-like clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting diverse wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization."
