It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for garden cultivation. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often used in landscaping and native plant restoration projects."
