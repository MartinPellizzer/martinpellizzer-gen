    "intro": "Corynopuntia nigrispina, commonly known as the black-spined cactus, is a species of flowering plant in the Cactaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dark spines, which provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Corynopuntia nigrispina is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
