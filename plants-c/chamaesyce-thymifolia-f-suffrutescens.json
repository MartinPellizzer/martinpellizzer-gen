    "intro": "Chamaesyce thymifolia f. suffrutescens, commonly known as the thyme-leaved sandmat, is a succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is native to regions with dry climates, such as parts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant typically grows in low, spreading mats, with small, pale green or reddish flowers that appear in late spring. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. This variety is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
