    "intro": "Centropetalum costaricense, commonly known as the Costa Rican centropetalum, is a flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing near the forest floor. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
