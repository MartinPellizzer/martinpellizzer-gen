    "intro": "Carex gracilis var. fluviatilis, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense vegetation. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
