    "intro": "Cinchona pallescens var. ovata, commonly known as the white cinchona, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its lanceolate leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that contain the seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It is valued for its alkaloid content, particularly quinine, which has historically been used to treat malaria. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
