    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum borneense, commonly known as the Bornean cirrhopetalum, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its showy, pinkish to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
