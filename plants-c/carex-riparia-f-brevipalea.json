    "intro": "Carex riparia f. brevipalea, commonly known as the narrow-pale sedge, is a variant of the common sedge found in wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are shorter and more compact compared to the typical form. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often near streams or in marshy areas. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
