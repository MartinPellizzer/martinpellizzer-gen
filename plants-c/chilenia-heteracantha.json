    "intro": "Chilenia heteracantha, commonly known as the Chilean thornapple, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes, and is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berry-like fruits containing toxic alkaloids. Its botanical features include opposite leaves with serrated edges and a woody structure that helps it survive in arid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores and is considered a potential ornamental plant in some regions."
