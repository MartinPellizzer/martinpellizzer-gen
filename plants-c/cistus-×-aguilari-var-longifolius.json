    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 aguilari var. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved rock rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or coastal environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a silvery underside, and it produces small, woody capsules as fruit. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
