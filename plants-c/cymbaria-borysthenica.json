It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30-60 centimeters. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often appearing in clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand the dry, temperate climate of its native habitat. Cymbaria borysthenica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
