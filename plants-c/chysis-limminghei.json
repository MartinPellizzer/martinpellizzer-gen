    "intro": "Chysis limminghei, commonly known as the Limminghei chysis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other tropical trees. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warm seasons. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a smooth texture and a slightly glossy surface. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Chysis limminghei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
