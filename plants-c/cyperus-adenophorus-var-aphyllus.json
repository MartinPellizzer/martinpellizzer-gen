    "intro": "Cyperus adenophorus var. aphyllus, commonly known as the leafless flatsedge, is a variant of the flatsedge genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its reduced foliage, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often sparse or absent. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and seasonally flooded areas. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often borne on short, erect stems. Botanically, it is notable for its morphological adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
