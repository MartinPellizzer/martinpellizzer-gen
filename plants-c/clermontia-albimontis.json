    "intro": "Clermontia albimontis, commonly known as the white mountain clermonthe, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats at high elevations, often in cloud forests. Its leaves are ovate and slightly hairy, and it produces showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Clermontia albimontis is considered a rare and endangered species."
