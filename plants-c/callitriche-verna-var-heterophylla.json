    "intro": "Callitriche verna var. heterophylla, commonly known as spring water-starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often floating or partially submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are usually oval or lance-shaped. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are typically white or pale blue in color. This variant is distinguished by its morphological differences in leaf shape and size compared to the typical form of Callitriche verna."
