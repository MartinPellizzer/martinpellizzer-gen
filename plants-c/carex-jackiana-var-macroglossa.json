    "intro": "Carex jackiana var. macroglossa, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered in a dense inflorescence. The varietal form, macroglossa, is distinguished by its larger, more elongated flower bracts compared to the typical variety."
