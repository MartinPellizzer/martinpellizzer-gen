    "intro": "Crucianella glauca var. laxiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and blue or bluish-green foliage. The species produces small, showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas. This variety is distinguished by its more open and lax inflorescences compared to the typical form of Crucianella glauca."
