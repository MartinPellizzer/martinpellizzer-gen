It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. It is often found in maritime climates where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
