It features showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity and its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
