    "intro": "Capnoides fedtschenkoana, commonly known as the Fedtschenkoan bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, while its stems are often hairy and robust. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
