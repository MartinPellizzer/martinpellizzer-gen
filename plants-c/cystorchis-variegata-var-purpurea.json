    "intro": "Cystorchis variegata var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple-stemmed orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive purple-tinged stems and lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
