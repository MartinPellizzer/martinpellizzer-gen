    "intro": "Centunculus pentandrus var. compactus, commonly known as the compact centaury, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, blue to violet flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its compact appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
