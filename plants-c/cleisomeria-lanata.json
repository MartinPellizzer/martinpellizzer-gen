    "intro": "Cleisomeria lanata, commonly known as the woolly cleisomeria, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by elongated, woody fruits called follicles. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyons. Cleisomeria lanata is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
