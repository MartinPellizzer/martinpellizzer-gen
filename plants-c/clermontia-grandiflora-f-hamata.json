    "intro": "Clermontia grandiflora f. hamata, commonly known as the Hamata Clermontia, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories, where it relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Its foliage consists of alternate, ovate leaves with a smooth surface and a glossy appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
