    "intro": "Cactus pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its columnar stem, which is typically ribbed and covered in clusters of spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to desert environments. The cactus also plays a role in supporting local wildlife, providing shelter and food for various insects and small animals."
