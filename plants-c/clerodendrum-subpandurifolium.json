It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant has opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually green with a slightly hairy texture. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. Clerodendrum subpandurifolium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
