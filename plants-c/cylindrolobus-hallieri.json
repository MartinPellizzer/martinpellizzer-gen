    "intro": "Cylindrolobus hallieri, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a distinctive member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of forests in New Zealand. Its rhizome is thick and robust, supporting the growth of the fronds and roots. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various native species."
