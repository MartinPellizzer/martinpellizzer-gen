    "intro": "Cyclamen holochlorum, commonly known as the white cyclamen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers during late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained soil. Its tuberous roots store nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of dormancy. Cyclamen holochlorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
