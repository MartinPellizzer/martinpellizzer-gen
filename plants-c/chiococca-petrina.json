    "intro": "Chiococca petrina, commonly known as the velvetleaf chiococca, is a woody climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, often velvety foliage. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Chiococca petrina is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
