    "intro": "Crotalaria claussenii, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with a rattle-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Crotalaria claussenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
