    "intro": "Calathea densa, commonly known as the velvetleaf calathea, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that display intricate patterns of deep green, silver, and pink. The plant belongs to the Marantaceae family and is often grown as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal. Calathea densa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Its foliage is also known for its sensitivity to light, which causes the leaf patterns to shift throughout the day."
