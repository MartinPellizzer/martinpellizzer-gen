    "intro": "Chondrosum microstachyum, commonly known as the small-stalked sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and adapted to extract moisture from the dry soil, making it highly drought-tolerant. Chondrosum microstachyum is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to thrive with minimal water and maintenance."
