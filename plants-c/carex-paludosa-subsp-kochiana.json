    "intro": "Carex paludosa subsp. kochiana, commonly known as the bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow, acidic soils along the edges of marshes, bogs, and swamps. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear yellowish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland habitats. This subspecies is adapted to consistently moist conditions and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland ecosystem."
