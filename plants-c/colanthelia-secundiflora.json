It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
