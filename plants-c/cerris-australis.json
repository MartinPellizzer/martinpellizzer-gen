    "intro": "Cerris australis, commonly known as the Australian ironwood, is a hardy evergreen tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rugged, fissured bark that provides a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, white flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing flat, leathery seeds. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can thrive in coastal and inland regions. Due to its durability and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping and as a windbreak."
