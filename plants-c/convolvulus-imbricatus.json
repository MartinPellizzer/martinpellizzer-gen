    "intro": "Convolvulus imbricatus, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a trailing perennial with heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of violet or blue. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via runners make it an effective ground cover. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
