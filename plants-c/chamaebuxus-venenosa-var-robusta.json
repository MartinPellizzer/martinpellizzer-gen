    "intro": "Chamaebuxus venenosa var. robusta, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees across sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds and other animals. Its parasitic nature means it derives nutrients from its host, often causing stress or damage to the host tree. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
