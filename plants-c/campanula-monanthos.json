    "intro": "Campanula monanthos, commonly known as the single-flower bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. Its flowers are actinomorphic, meaning they are radially symmetrical, and are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. Campanula monanthos prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders."
