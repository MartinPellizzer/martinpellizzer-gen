    "intro": "Carduus atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic thistle, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of the western Atlantic. It features a robust, upright stem covered in dense, spiny leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces purple to pink composite flower heads, which are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a spherical shape. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural or disturbed habitats."
