    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. emarginatodenticulata, commonly known as the frayed spleenwort, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive frayed or toothed margin that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or soil in temperate regions. The spores are produced in sori that are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often found in woodland habitats."
