    "intro": "Carex psammophila, commonly known as the sand sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or disturbed areas. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, Carex psammophila plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
