    "intro": "Castanopsis amabilis var. brevispinosa, commonly known as the small-spined talaud, is a species of evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood. The plant produces small, cupule-enclosed nuts that are typically dispersed by animals. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a leathery texture, adapting to the humid, tropical environments it inhabits. The tree is valued for both its ecological role and its timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
