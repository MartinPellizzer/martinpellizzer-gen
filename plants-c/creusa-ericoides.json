    "intro": "Creusa ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf willow or creeping willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and forest edges. Its stems are flexible and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Creusa ericoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
