    "intro": "Cardamine bilobata, commonly known as the twin-lobed watercress, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with two lobes on each leaflet. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively in wet soils. It is often found in stream banks, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
