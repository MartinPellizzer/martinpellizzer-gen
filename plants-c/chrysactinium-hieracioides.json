    "intro": "Chrysactinium hieracioides, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, silvery-green leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical structure supports its role as a nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
