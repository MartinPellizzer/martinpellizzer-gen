    "intro": "Coccoloba tiliacea, commonly known as the coral tree or beach hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows near coastal areas, thriving in sandy soils and saline environments. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, often covered in a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its showy, pink or red flowers bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Coccoloba tiliacea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
