    "intro": "Combretum apiculatum var. viscosum, commonly known as the sticky combretum, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its rough, often sticky bark and opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually gland-dotted. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins or along stream banks. The sticky secretions on its leaves and stems may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and pathogens."
