    "intro": "Cattleya gaskelliana, commonly known as the Gaskell's orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a sympodial orchid with a pseudobulb structure that supports its growth and storage of nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cattleya gaskelliana is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
