    "intro": "Colchicum leistneri, commonly known as the Leistner's colchicum, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Colchicaceae and is characterized by its striking, helmet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a basal rosette of lance-shaped, glaucous leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
