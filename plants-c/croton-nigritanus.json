    "intro": "Croton nigritanus, commonly known as black croton, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often dark green with a bluish or purplish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it may be invasive in some regions."
