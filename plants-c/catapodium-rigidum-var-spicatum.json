    "intro": "Catapodium rigidum var. spicatum, commonly known as the spiny catapodium, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and stiff, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are typically green to reddish in color. Its fibrous roots make it a valuable plant for erosion control and soil stabilization. The species is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
