    "intro": "Cotoneaster insignoides, commonly known as the Himalayan cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features small, oval leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Cotoneaster insignoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes."
