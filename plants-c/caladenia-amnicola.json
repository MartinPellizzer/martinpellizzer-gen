    "intro": "Caladenia amnicola, commonly known as the river orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and striking, pinkish-red flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along riverbanks and drainage lines, thriving in moist, well-drained environments. Caladenia amnicola produces a single or few flowers per stem, each with a distinctive, hood-like labellum that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Its botanical features make it a notable and ecologically significant species within its native habitat."
