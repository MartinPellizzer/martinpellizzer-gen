It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 millimeter wide, giving it a delicate appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
