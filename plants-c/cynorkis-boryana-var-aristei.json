    "intro": "Cynorkis boryana var. aristei, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant features showy, bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for herbivores."
