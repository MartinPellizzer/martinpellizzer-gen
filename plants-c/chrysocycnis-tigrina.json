    "intro": "Chrysocycnis tigrina, commonly known as the tiger orchid, is a striking flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tiger-striped petals that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters, emitting a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Chrysocycnis tigrina is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
