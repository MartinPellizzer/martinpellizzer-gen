    "intro": "Ceropegia remota, commonly known as the Ghost Flower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant has succulent, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, powdery coating. Ceropegia remota is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves to survive in dry conditions."
