    "intro": "Carex polystachya var. bartlettii, commonly known as Bartlett's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and along stream banks, and prefers full to partial sunlight. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flower heads. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soil and support local biodiversity. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability."
