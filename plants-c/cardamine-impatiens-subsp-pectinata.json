    "intro": "Cardamine impatiens subsp. pectinata, commonly known as the pectinate watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features finely divided, pinnately lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in early spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology, with the leaves having a pectinate (tooth-like) edge that gives it its common name."
