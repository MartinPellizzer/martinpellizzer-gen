    "intro": "Costus scaberulus, commonly known as the rough costus, is a tropical plant belonging to the Zingiberaceae family. It is characterized by its erect, somewhat woody stem and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to orange flowers with a distinct, aromatic scent. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its drought tolerance, it is suitable for xeriscaping in arid climates."
