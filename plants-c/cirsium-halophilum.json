    "intro": "Cirsium halophilum, commonly known as saltweed thistle, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its robust, spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline environments, such as salt marshes and coastal dunes, due to its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations. Its fibrous root system helps it stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. Cirsium halophilum plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and maintaining coastal ecosystems."
