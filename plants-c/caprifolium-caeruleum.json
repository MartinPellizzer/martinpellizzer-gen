    "intro": "Caprifolium caeruleum, commonly known as blue honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, often turning red in the fall. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks."
