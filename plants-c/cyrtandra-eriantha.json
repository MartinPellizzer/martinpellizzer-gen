    "intro": "Cyrtandra eriantha, commonly known as the silverleaf cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an herb or shrub, often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. Cyrtandra eriantha plays a role in local ecosystems and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
