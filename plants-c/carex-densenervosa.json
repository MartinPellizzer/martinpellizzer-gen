    "intro": "Carex densenervosa, commonly known as the dense-veined sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. Native to North America, it thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and stream banks. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in suitable habitats. Its dense vein structure in the leaves is a distinguishing botanical feature."
