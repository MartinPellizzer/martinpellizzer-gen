    "intro": "Cypholophus ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. Native to the freshwater habitats of southern Africa, it thrives in still or slow-moving waters with muddy substrates. The plant typically grows in dense mats, with its stems and leaves submerged, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
