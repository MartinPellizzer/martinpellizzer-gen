    "intro": "Crepidomanes fargesii, commonly known as the Farges' crepidomanes, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded, and moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
