    "intro": "Cirsium autumnale, commonly known as the autumnal thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring rough, hairy stems and deeply lobed, silvery-green leaves. The plant produces purple to pinkish-purple flower heads in the late summer to autumn, which are composed of many small florets. Its spiny bracts and robust structure make it a distinctive member of the Asteraceae family. Cirsium autumnale is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
