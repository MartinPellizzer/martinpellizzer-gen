    "intro": "Calanthe masuca var. nivalis, commonly known as the snow calanthe, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the high altitudes of Japan. It is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on forest floors or rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
