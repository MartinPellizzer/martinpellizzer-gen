    "intro": "Carex cladostachya f. polystachya, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshes, wetlands, or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike of small, three-ranked flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is distinguished by its longer, more densely packed spikes and hairy nodes, contributing to its unique botanical appearance."
