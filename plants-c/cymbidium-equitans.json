    "intro": "Cymbidium equitans, commonly known as the horse riding orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, arching inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, often pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water, enabling it to survive in drier conditions. Cymbidium equitans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated for indoor and garden use."
