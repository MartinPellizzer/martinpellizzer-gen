    "intro": "Cardamine ocoana, commonly known as the mountain buttercup, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its basal leaves that are typically divided into lobes, and its small, yellowish flowers with five petals. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a short growing season and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Cardamine ocoana is also noted for its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its natural habitat."
