    "intro": "Cyperus nocha, commonly known as the black flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, three-lobed flowers that are often clustered in spikelets. Cyperus nocha is often found in disturbed wetlands and can serve as an indicator species for certain aquatic habitats."
