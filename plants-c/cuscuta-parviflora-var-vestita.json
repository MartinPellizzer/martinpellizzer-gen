    "intro": "Cuscuta parviflora var. vestita, commonly known as the white dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is often found growing on agricultural crops and weeds, making it a common weed in cultivated fields. Its seeds are tiny and can remain viable in the soil for many years, contributing to its persistent presence. The species is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is widely distributed across Europe, Asia, and North America."
