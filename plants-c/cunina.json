    "intro": "Cunina, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark red bark and small, leathery leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by winged fruits. Cunina is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in crafting and as a source of essential oils. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its natural habitat."
