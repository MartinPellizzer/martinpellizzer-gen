    "intro": "Columnea antiocana, commonly known as the Antioquian flame flower, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are often branched and trailing. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea antiocana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
