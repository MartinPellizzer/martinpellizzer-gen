    "intro": "Coptis teeta subsp. teeta, commonly known as the Himalayan goldthread, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its slender, rhizomatous stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, typically between 2,000 and 4,000 meters above sea level. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with three broadly ovate leaflets, and it produces distinctive, bead-like berries that contain the seeds. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties, containing alkaloids such as coptisine and berberine, which have been traditionally used in herbal medicine."
