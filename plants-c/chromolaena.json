    "intro": "Chromolaena, commonly known as  \"goatweed\" or \"milkweed,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common weed in tropical and subtropical regions. The plants typically have opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow. Chromolaena species are often invasive, outcompeting native vegetation and sometimes causing ecological disruption. Some species are used in traditional medicine, though their ornamental value is also recognized in horticulture."
