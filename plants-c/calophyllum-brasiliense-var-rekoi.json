It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown to black bark and dense, glossy green foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by woody, orange-red fruits containing flat, elliptical seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
