    "intro": "Cyrtopera sabulosa, commonly known as the sand flat moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, sandy environments. It is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like structures that are typically arranged in a dense, cushion-like growth pattern. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. It is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shorelines where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy substrates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in certain regions."
