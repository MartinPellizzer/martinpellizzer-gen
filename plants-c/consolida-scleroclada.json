    "intro": "Consolida scleroclada, commonly known as the desert sweet pea, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of spurred, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its seeds are enclosed in slender, spiral-shaped pods, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Consolida scleroclada is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
