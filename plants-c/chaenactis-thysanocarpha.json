    "intro": "Chaenactis thysanocarpha, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada pappusweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its narrow, silvery-gray leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The showy yellow flowers appear in late spring and are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds that aid in its propagation."
