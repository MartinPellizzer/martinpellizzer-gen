    "intro": "Ctenitis effusa var. divergens, commonly known as the broad-leafed sea holly, is a rare and delicate marine plant found in coastal regions. It belongs to the family Cystophoraceae and is characterized by its unique, fan-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky coating. The plant thrives in intertidal zones, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and fluctuating water levels. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically producing spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
