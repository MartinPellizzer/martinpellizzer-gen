    "intro": "Coronilla lotoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a legume belonging to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Coronilla lotoides is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
