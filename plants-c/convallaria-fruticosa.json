It features a dense cluster of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces bell-shaped, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its fragrant, clustered flowers and is often found in shaded, moist woodland areas. It is known for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its cardiac glycosides. However, it is toxic if ingested and should be handled with care."
