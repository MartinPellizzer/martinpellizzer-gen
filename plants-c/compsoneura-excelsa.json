    "intro": "Compsoneura excelsa, commonly known as the giant sedge, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, grass-like appearance with long, narrow leaves and tall, clustered inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in mangrove ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. Compsoneura excelsa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
