    "intro": "Colymbada polymorpha, commonly known as the common water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, floating mats of small, heart-shaped leaves that form a dense vegetation layer on the water surface. The plant has slender, branching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, and are pollinated by insects. Colymbada polymorpha plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems by reducing erosion and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
