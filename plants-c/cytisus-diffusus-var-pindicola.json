It features slender, often spiny stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are arranged in pairs along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to sunny, dry environments. This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to colonize disturbed or barren landscapes."
