    "intro": "Chamaefistula undulata, commonly known as the undulating boxwood, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that forms compact, rounded clusters. The leaves are typically small, leathery, and have a waxy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. It produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
