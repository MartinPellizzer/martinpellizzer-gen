    "intro": "Commelina radicans, commonly known as the creeping spiderwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a sprawling growth habit with rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, often with three petals and two sepals. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy surface and are arranged alternately along the stems. Commelina radicans thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
