    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 barcinonensis, commonly known as the Barcino hybrid, is a hybrid species within the genus Centaurea, native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and spiny, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is a short-lived perennial that produces numerous small, seed-like fruits known as achenes. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
