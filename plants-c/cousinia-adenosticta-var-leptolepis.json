    "intro": "Cousinia adenosticta var. leptolepis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed cushionflower, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of narrow, blue-gray leaves that form a compact cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil, exhibiting drought tolerance and slow growth. This variety is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range."
