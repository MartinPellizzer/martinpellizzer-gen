    "intro": "Centaurea longiaristata, commonly known as the long-stemmed centaurea, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bristly, spiny seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or sandy habitats. Centaurea longiaristata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
