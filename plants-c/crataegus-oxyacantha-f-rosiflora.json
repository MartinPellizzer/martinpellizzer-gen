    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha f. rosiflora, commonly known as the rose-flowered hawthorn, is a botanical variant of the common hawthorn. It is characterized by its showy, pink to white flowers that resemble roses, making it a striking ornamental plant. The flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, adding visual interest to gardens. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, where it thrives in woodland and scrub habitats. It produces small, red berries in the fall, which are edible but often used for their ornamental value rather than consumption."
