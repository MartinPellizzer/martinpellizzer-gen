    "intro": "Cestrum pseudopedicellatum, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange-red tubular flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
