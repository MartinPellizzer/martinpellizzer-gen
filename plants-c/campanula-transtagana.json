It features upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or woodland borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
