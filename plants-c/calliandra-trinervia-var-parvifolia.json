    "intro": "Calliandra trinervia var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved calliandra, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The leaves are trifoliate, with three small, narrow leaflets, and the plant is often grown as an ornamental or for its nitrogen-fixing properties. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for warm climates. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
