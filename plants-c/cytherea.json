    "intro": "Cytherea, commonly known as the \"flower of the sea,\" is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found along the shores of the Atlantic Ocean. The plant produces small, pale pink or white flowers that bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in its arid environment. Cytherea is valued not only for its aesthetic beauty but also for its ecological importance in stabilizing coastal dunes."
