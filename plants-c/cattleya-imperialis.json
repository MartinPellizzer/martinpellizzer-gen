    "intro": "Cattleya imperialis, commonly known as the imperial cattleya, is a striking orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter, featuring vibrant pink or purple hues with contrasting white or yellow markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Cattleya imperialis is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
