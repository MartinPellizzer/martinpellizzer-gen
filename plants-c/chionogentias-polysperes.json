    "intro": "Chionogentias polysperes, commonly known as the snow-flower plant, is a rare and delicate species native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with short, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
