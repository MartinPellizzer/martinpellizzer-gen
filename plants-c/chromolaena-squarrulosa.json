    "intro": "Chromolaena squarrulosa, commonly known as flame weed or Croton weed, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a reddish or purple hue. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it an invasive species in many regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land management."
