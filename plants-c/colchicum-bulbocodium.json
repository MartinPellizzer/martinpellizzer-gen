    "intro": "Colchicum bulbocodium, commonly known as the purple autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It produces striking violet-blue to purple flowers in the autumn, typically from September to November. The plant has a bulbous root system, which stores nutrients and allows it to survive harsh winters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging after the flowers have bloomed. The plant is also known for containing colchicine, a compound used in medicine and research."
