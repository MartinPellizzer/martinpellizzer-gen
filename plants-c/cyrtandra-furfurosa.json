    "intro": "Cyrtandra furfurosa, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a fine, whitish pubescence."
