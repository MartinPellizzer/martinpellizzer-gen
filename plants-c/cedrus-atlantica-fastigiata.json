    "intro": "Cedrus atlantica fastigiata, commonly known as the Atlas cedar, is a compact, columnar conifer native to the Atlas Mountains of North Africa. It features dense, dark green foliage that is arranged in tight, vertical clusters along its slender, upright trunk. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain edible, winged seeds. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for small gardens or as a specimen plant. The bark is reddish-brown and develops deep fissures as the tree matures."
