    "intro": "Coryphantha calcarata, commonly known as the rock hedgehog cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus that typically forms dense clusters of small, green, ribbed stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments with minimal rainfall. Coryphantha calcarata is often found growing on rocky slopes and in desert scrub habitats."
