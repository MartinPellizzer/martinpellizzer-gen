    "intro": "Cephalophyllum cupreum, commonly known as the copperleaf, is a rare and striking plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a member of the Onagraceae family, which includes species like willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its vivid copper-colored leaves, which are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
