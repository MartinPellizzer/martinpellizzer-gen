    "intro": "Coelandria smillieae, commonly known as the Smillie's coelandria, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture, and it produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coelandria smillieae is considered a species of conservation concern."
