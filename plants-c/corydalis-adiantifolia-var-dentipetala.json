    "intro": "Corydalis adiantifolia var. dentipetala, commonly known as the toothed petal corydalis, is a flowering plant in the family Fumariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. It has a creeping rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The flowers bloom in early spring, adding a subtle yet elegant touch to its natural habitat."
