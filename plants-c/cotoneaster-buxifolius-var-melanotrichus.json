    "intro": "Cotoneaster buxifolius var. melanotrichus, commonly known as the black-haired cotoneaster, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is often used in rock gardens and as a hedge plant."
