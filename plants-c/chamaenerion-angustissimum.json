    "intro": "Chamaenerion angustissimum, commonly known as narrowleaf fireweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pink to red flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in tundra, alpine, and wetland habitats. Chamaenerion angustissimum is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions."
