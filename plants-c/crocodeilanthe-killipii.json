    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe killipii, commonly known as the Killip's crocodile fern, is a rare and distinctive epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its unique, crocodile-like fronds that are deeply lobed and have a rugged, textured appearance. Native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
