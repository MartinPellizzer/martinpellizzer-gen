    "intro": "Crataegus calpodendron var. obesa, commonly known as the fat-leaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically broader and more rounded than those of other hawthorn species. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental plant in native landscapes."
