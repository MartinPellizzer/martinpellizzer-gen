    "intro": "Ceratopyxis verbenacea, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, blue-gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has a creeping growth habit with rhizomatous stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
