    "intro": "Chaetochloa viridis var. breviseta, commonly known as the slender spikegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, erect stems that are typically less than 30 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing greenish or yellowish flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in saturated soils and is often found in coastal or inland wetlands. Its dense growth helps stabilize soil and provides habitat for various wetland organisms."
