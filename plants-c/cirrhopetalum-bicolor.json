    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored cirrhopetalum, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its strikingly contrasting floral colors. The plant features showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers with a distinctive two-toned appearance, often in shades of red and white. Its leaves are typically ovate and glossy, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Cirrhopetalum bicolor is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and streamside vegetation."
