    "intro": "Coleataenia stenodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches itself to submerged rocks or vegetation. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant within its habitat. The small, spore-bearing structures called sori are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
