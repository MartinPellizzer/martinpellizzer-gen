    "intro": "Casuarina torulosa f. gracilior, commonly known as the slender casuarina, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in coastal stabilization projects."
