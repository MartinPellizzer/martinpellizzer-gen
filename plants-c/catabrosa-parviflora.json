    "intro": "Catabrosa parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered catabrosa, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage that helps retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale blue flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly waxy texture, which aids in reducing water loss. Catabrosa parviflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
