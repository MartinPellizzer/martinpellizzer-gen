    "intro": "Cyrtandra lysiosepala, commonly known as the Hawaiian cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its attractive, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories on the islands of Maui and Hawai'i. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
