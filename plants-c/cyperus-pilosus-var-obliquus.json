    "intro": "Cyperus pilosus var. obliquus, commonly known as the hairy flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, along riverbanks, or in disturbed sites. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in aquatic and semi-aquatic environments."
