    "intro": "Corion atheniense, commonly known as the Athens corion, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a cool, temperate climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
