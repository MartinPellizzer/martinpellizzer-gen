It is a robust, climbing palm characterized by its slender, jointed stems and long, narrow leaves. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in wet, tropical environments, often found in swamps or along riverbanks. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish-white flowers, followed by dark, round fruits. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for aquatic and bog gardens."
