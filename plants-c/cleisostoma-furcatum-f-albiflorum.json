It is characterized by its striking white flowers, which contrast sharply with its green foliage. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in tropical forest environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters and emit a subtle fragrance, attracting pollinators such as moths and bees. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouse settings for its aesthetic appeal."
