    "intro": "Convolvulus brasilianus, commonly known as Brazilian morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, vibrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in warm, tropical climates. Its climbing habit is facilitated by its twining stems, which wrap around supports as it grows. The leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
