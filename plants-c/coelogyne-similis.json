    "intro": "Coelogyne similis, commonly known as the similar orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, including countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is a sympodial orchid with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with red or orange markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Coelogyne similis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
