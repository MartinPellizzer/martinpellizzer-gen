    "intro": "Cyrtopodium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered lady's slipper, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, pale pink or white flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it is often epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks. Cyrtopodium parviflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its delicate appearance."
