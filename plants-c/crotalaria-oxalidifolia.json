It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often mistaken for oxalis species due to their similar appearance.

Crotalaria oxalidifolia is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for agricultural practices."
