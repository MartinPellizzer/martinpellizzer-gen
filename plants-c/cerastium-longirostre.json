    "intro": "Cerastium longirostre, commonly known as the long-beaked mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, typically appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, often with a hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Cerastium longirostre is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, ground-covering mats."
