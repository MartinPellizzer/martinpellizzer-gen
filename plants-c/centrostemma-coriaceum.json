    "intro": "Centrostemma coriaceum, commonly known as the rough centrostemma, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance. Its leaves are thick and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Centrostemma coriaceum is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems."
