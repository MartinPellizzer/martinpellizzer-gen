It consists of several species, most of which are native to Africa and the Americas. These plants are typically herbaceous, with hairy, silver-gray foliage that gives them their common name. They produce small, daisy-like flowers that are usually yellow or white in color. Chionolaena species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, where they thrive in well-drained soils."
