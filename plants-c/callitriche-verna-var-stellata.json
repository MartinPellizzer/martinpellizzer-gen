    "intro": "Callitriche verna var. stellata, commonly known as starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds, streams, and ditches, and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers. The plant has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is an important part of wetland ecosystems. Callitriche verna var. stellata is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
