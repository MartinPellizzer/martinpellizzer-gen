    "intro": "[WRONG START] Calamagrostis inexpensa var. robusta, commonly known as the robust reedgrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically silver-green in color. The plant produces panicles of fluffy, white to silver flowers in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, pond edges, and along stream banks. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration and landscaping projects."
