    "intro": "Ceraia setifera, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Plumbaginaceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which are adapted to coastal environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shores and dunes. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Ceraia setifera is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind, making it a hardy species in maritime climates."
