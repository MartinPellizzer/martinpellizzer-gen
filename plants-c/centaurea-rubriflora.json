    "intro": "Centaurea rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and yellow stamens, which give it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, fluffy seed heads that aid in wind pollination. Centaurea rubriflora is often found in open habitats such as coastal areas and dry meadows."
