    "intro": "Coprosma nigricarpa, commonly known as black-fruited coprosma, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dark purple to black berries that mature in late summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with glossy, dark green leaves. Its flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters, and it is often found in forested areas. The berries are an important food source for native birds, contributing to seed dispersal in its natural habitat."
