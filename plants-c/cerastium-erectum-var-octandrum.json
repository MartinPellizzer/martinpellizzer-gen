    "intro": "Cerastium erectum var. octandrum, commonly known as the eight-stamen mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers with eight stamens, which give it its botanical name. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces small, dark blue to black berries. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet habitats."
