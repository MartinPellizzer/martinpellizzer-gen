    "intro": "Corylopsis sinensis var. sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese flame-leaf bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange-red flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has slender, arching branches and small, ovate leaves that turn reddish in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Its ornamental value comes primarily from its vibrant floral display and autumn foliage."
