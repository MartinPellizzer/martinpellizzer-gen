    "intro": "Chrysanthemum alpinum var. minimum, commonly known as the alpine dwarf chrysanthemum, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
