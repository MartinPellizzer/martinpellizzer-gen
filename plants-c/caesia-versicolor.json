    "intro": "Caesia versicolor, commonly known as the variable ladies' tresses, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wet meadows. Its flowers are arranged in a dense, spike-like cluster, and it is often found in association with other orchid species. Caesia versicolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
