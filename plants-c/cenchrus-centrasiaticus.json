It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common species in sandy and saline soils. Its leaves are narrow and\u575a\u97e7, with a rough texture, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions. It is often used for forage and erosion control in its native regions."
