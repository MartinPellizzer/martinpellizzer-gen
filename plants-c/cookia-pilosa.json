    "intro": "Cookia pilosa, commonly known as the woolly cookia, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Cookia pilosa is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
