    "intro": "Cissampelos andromorpha, commonly known as the African moon vine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by orange to reddish berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires full to partial sunlight. Its rapid growth makes it suitable for ornamental use in gardens and as a cover plant in ecological restoration projects."
