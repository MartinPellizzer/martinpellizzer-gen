    "intro": "Centropogon silvaticus, commonly known as the swamp morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sunny environments such as swamps and marshes. The plant produces striking blue or purple trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are hairy and sprawling. Centropogon silvaticus plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
