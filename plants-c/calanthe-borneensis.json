    "intro": "Calanthe borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean calanthe, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant features broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are usually pink or purple with a distinctive yellow or green lip, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Calanthe borneensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
