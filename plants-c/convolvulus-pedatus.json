    "intro": "Convolvulus pedatus, commonly known as the walking foot or the spurred morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Bindweed family (Convolvulaceae). It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, and it is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often with a distinctive spurred appendage at the base. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Convolvulus pedatus is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments."
