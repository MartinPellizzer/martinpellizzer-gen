It typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has slender stems and small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, producing small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
