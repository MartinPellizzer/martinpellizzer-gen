    "intro": "Calypso bulbosa f. candida, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking variant of the Calypso bulbosa species. It is characterized by its pale, almost white petals and a compact, elegant floral structure. This orchid is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in the Carolinas and Florida, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features include a slender rhizome and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
