It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant features palmate leaves with a distinctive, somewhat fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its botanical name reflects its historical use in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a nectar source for pollinators."
