    "intro": "Clavija lancifolia, commonly known as the lancifoliate clavija, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and not widely cultivated outside its native range."
