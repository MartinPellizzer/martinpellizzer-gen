    "intro": "Chaenorhinum origanifolium var. glabratum, commonly known as the glabrous heartleaf toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the \"glabratum\" variety has reduced hair, giving it a smoother appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
