It is characterized by its vibrant yellow lips and greenish-white petals, which make it highly sought after in horticulture. The plant produces pendulous flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a sweet fragrance. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
