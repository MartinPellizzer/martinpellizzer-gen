    "intro": "Cyperorchis whiteae, commonly known as the White's sedge orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and delicate, orchid-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss, Cyperorchis whiteae is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
