    "intro": "Citrus cornuta, commonly known as the horned citrus, is a rare and unique species native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like protrusions on its leaves and fruit, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are edible and have a tangy flavor. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
