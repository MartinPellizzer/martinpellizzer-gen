    "intro": "Clethra formosa, commonly known as the fragrant sweet pepperbush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, red, edible berries that are often consumed by birds and small mammals. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Clethra formosa prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a versatile addition to woodland gardens."
