    "intro": "Carex distans var. baetica, commonly known as the Baetica sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or shrubland habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
