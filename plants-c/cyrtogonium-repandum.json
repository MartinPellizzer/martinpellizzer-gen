    "intro": "Cyrtogonium repandum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in water gardens and ponds. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as lakes and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats that can help stabilize sediments and improve water quality. Cyrtogonium repandum is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits in aquatic ecosystems."
