It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and can reach heights of up to 2 feet.
