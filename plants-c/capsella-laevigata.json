    "intro": "Capsella laevigata, commonly known as the common mouse-ear or mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb characterized by its smooth, spoon-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces spherical, three-valved pods that contain several seeds. Native to Europe, it has been naturalized in parts of North America and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
