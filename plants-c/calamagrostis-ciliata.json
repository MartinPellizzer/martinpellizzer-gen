    "intro": "Calamagrostis ciliata, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and tall, slender culms that often reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas. Calamagrostis ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
