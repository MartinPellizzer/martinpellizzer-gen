    "intro": "Carex leptalea subsp. pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and tapering, with a bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brownish flowers, which are borne on slender, leafless stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
