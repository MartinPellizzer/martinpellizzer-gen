    "intro": "Cereus candicans var. spinosior, commonly known as the spiny night bloomer, is a cactus species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in arid environments with well-draining soil and requires minimal water. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
