    "intro": "Cotoneaster acutiuscula, commonly known as the sharp-lobed cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. Its compact growth habit and ornamental berries make it a popular choice for landscaping. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
