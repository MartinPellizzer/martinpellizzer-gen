    "intro": "Cuscuta monogyna, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found on grasses, legumes, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host, making it a concern in agricultural settings."
