    "intro": "Cerastium fontanum var. eglandulosum, commonly known as the glandular mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, hairy leaves that are oval to heart-shaped, often with a glandular texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, adapting it to its often humid habitats."
