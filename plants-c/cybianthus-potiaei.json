    "intro": "Cybianthus potiaei, commonly known as the Potosi lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cybianthus potiaei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
