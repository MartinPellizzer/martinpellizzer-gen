    "intro": "Carex macrochaeta var. subrigida, commonly known as the rigid hairgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike of pale green to brownish spikelets, which are clustered at the top of the stem. The rigid hairgrass is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
