    "intro": "Christella dentata, commonly known as the toothed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that have serrated edges. Its most distinctive feature is its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Christella dentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
