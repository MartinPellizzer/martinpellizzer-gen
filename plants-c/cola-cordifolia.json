    "intro": "Cola cordifolia, commonly known as African cola or heart-leaved cola, is a tropical shrub native to West Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is notable for its seeds, which are encased in a hard, smooth pod and contain a stimulant compound called caffeine. Cola cordifolia is often cultivated for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of caffeine. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts within its native region."
