    "intro": "Columnea gigantifolia, commonly known as the giant flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting hummingbirds and other pollinators. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea gigantifolia is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its bold, showy flowers and compact growth habit."
