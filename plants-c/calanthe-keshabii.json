    "intro": "Calanthe keshabii, commonly known as the Keshabii calanthe, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often a deep green. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade, making it a challenging but rewarding plant for cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
