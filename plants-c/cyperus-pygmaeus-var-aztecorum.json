    "intro": "Cyperus pygmaeus var. aztecorum, commonly known as the dwarf flatsedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. This variety typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, ponds, or along waterways. Its compact size and ability to thrive in aquatic environments make it an important component of wetland ecosystems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family."
