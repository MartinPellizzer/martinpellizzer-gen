    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum subsp. alpinum, commonly known as alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in cold, dry environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its compact form and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it a characteristic component of alpine vegetation."
