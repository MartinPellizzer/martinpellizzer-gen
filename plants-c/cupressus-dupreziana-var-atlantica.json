    "intro": "Cupressus dupreziana var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic cedar, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive scale-like leaves and cone-bearing structure, which are adapted to the arid and coastal environments of its habitat. The plant exhibits a unique morphology, including its twisted branches and thick, aromatic wood. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
