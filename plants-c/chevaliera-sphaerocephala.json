    "intro": "Chevaliera sphaerocephala, commonly known as the globe-headed orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, rounded flower spike that gives it its common name. Its flowers are typically pale green to white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
