    "intro": "Carex fusca var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States. It typically grows in wet, sandy soils along the Atlantic coast, often in dunes or salt marshes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to saline and brackish environments, making it a key component of coastal ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and periodic flooding makes it an important pioneer species in dune stabilization."
