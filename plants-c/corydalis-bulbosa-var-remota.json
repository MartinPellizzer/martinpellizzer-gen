    "intro": "Corydalis bulbosa var. remota, commonly known as the remote bulbous corydalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, hairy stems that produce clusters of delicate, spurred flowers in shades of pink and purple. The plant has bulbous roots that store nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its ability to retain moisture. Corydalis bulbosa var. remota is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
