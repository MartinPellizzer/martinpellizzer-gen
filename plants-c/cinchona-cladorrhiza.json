It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and ornamental flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 15 meters, with a dense canopy and dark green leaves. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels. The bark of Cinchona cladorrhiza contains alkaloids, though it is less renowned for quinine production compared to other Cinchona species."
