    "intro": "Cephalocereus exerens, commonly known as the spider cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 10 feet in height. The plant produces clusters of white, tubular flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. The plant is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience in dry conditions."
