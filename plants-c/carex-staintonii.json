It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
