    "intro": "Cyperus fendlerianus var. major, commonly known as the broadleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It is often found in disturbed soils and can tolerate a wide range of moisture conditions. Its botanical structure makes it adaptable to various wetland environments, contributing to its ecological significance in riparian zones."
