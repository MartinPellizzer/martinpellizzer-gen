    "intro": "Carex alta var. brevior, commonly known as the short-stemmed tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and arranged in dense, tussock-like clumps. Its flowering spikes are usually borne on tall, slender stems, and the flowers are small and clustered in spikelets. This variety is characterized by its shorter stature compared to the typical Carex alta, making it distinct in appearance."
