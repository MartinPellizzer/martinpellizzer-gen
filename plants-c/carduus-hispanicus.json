    "intro": "Carduus hispanicus, commonly known as the Spanish thistle, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrublands and wastelands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas."
