    "intro": "Cremastosperma monospermum var. brachypodum, commonly known as the short-rooted sandbur, is a flowering plant in the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny fruits that contain seeds with a hard, protective coating. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is native to regions of the southwestern United States. It has small, alternate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Due to its prickly seeds, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
