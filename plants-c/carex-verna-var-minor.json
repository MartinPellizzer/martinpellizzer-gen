    "intro": "Carex verna var. minor, commonly known as the lesser spring sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant features grass-like leaves that are narrow and slightly twisted, with a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers that are usually green or brown. This variety is closely related to other Carex species and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
