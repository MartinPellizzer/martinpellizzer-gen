It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Creaghia is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain regions."
