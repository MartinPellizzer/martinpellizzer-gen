    "intro": "Cuphea rupestris, commonly known as the rockcup plant, is a species of flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its foliage is usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Cuphea rupestris is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
