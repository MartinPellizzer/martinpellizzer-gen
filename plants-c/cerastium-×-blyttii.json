    "intro": "Cerastium \u00d7 blyttii, commonly known as the common mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in gardens. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is known for its rapid spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. Due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in various conditions, it is often considered a weed in cultivated areas."
