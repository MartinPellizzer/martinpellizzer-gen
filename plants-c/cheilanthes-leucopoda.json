    "intro": "Cheilanthes leucopoda, commonly known as the white-haired rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and dark green, leathery fronds with a dense covering of white, silky hairs. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in rocky, well-drained soils. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes leucopoda is often found in crevices and on rock faces, where it thrives in full sun and minimal water."
