    "intro": "Cousinia margaritae, commonly known as the alpine cowpea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Cousinia margaritae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
