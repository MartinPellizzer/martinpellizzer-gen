    "intro": "Cytisus hirsutus var. bosniacus, commonly known as the Bosnian broom, is a shrub native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is adapted to grow in well-drained, often calcareous soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant in temperate climates. This variety is closely related to other species in the Genista genus and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
