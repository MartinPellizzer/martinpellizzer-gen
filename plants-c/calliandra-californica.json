    "intro": "Calliandra californica, commonly known as the California calliandra, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 feet. The plant is characterized by its feathery, pink to red bracts that surround small, clustered flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, delicate leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid climates."
