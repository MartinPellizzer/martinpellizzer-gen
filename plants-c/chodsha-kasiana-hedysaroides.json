    "intro": "Chodsha-kasiana hedysaroides, commonly known as the Kashmir Himalayan oxytropis, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
