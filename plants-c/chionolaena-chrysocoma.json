It typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. The plant has silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom from spring to summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional medicinal uses."
