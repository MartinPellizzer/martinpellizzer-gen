    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis fuhsingensis, commonly known as the Hsiushui ironwood, is a rare and ancient tree species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a leathery texture, and it produces small, spiny acorns that are dispersed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
