    "intro": "Ceropegia squamulata, commonly known as the velvet leaf or string of hearts, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which are pollinated by specific insects. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Ceropegia squamulata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
