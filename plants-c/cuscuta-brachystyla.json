    "intro": "Cuscuta brachystyla, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to parts of North America and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host, and it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops. Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in many regions where it is invasive."
