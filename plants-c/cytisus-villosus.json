    "intro": "Cytisus villosus, commonly known as the hairy broom, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Cytisus villosus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
