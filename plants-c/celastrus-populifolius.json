It features opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin and produces clusters of small, yellow-green flowers in the spring. The plant is characterized by its distinctive orange-red berries that ripen in the fall, containing toxic seeds. It thrives in woodland areas and along fences, often climbing trees or shrubs. Its botanical name reflects its leaf shape, resembling that of a poplar tree."
