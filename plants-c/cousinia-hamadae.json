    "intro": "Cousinia hamadae, commonly known as the Hamada's cushion flower, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing rosette of silver-gray leaves and produces small, pink or purple flowers in late spring. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Cousinia hamadae is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing desert soils."
