    "intro": "Cynometra lukei, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing flat, seed-like structures. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland areas and is valued for its durable wood. However, it is considered a threatened species due to habitat loss and overexploitation."
