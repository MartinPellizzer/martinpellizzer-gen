    "intro": "Coilostylis ciliaris, commonly known as the coastal sandflat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the edges of estuaries and lagoons. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs. It is adapted to saline and tidal environments, making it an important component of coastal vegetation. Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions contributes to its role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting local biodiversity."
