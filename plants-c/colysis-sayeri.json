    "intro": "Colysis sayeri, commonly known as the Sayer's colysis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in well-drained, sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Colysis sayeri is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
