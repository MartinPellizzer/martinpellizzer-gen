    "intro": "Coryphopteris andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the United States, particularly found in the Appalachian region. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive, dense arrangement of small, lance-shaped pinnae. Coryphopteris andersonii plays a role in maintaining forest biodiversity and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
