    "intro": "Cynoglossum officinale var. sempervirens, commonly known as everlasting blueweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions. Its common name reflects its ability to retain its color and form for extended periods, making it a popular choice for dried floral arrangements."
