    "intro": "Crepidium melanophyllum, commonly known as the black-leaved orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green to blackish foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
