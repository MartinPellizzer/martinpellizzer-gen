    "intro": "Colchicum erdalii, commonly known as the Erdal lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Colchicaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a single, large, cup-shaped flower with purple petals and yellow stamens, which are often adorned with distinctive markings. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in rocky, well-drained soils, and the plant is known for its slow growth and long dormancy period. Colchicum erdalii is also noted for containing colchicine, a compound with medicinal and toxic properties."
