    "intro": "Copiapoa magnimamma, commonly known as the giant mammillary cactus, is a species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its large, ribbed stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces tall, spiny areoles with clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its adaptations include thick, water-storing stems and a reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. Copiapoa magnimamma is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-drained, sandy soils with minimal rainfall."
