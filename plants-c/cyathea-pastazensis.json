    "intro": "Cyathea pastazensis, commonly known as the Pastaza tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rainforests and cloud forests. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in the soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. Cyathea pastazensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
