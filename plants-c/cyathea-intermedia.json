    "intro": "Cyathea intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea intermedia reproduces via spores, which are released from the undersides of its sporangia located on the fronds. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
