    "intro": "Ctenanthe compressa, commonly known as the velvetleaf caladium, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers that are not particularly showy. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect light to flourish. Ctenanthe compressa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its foliage rather than its flowers."
