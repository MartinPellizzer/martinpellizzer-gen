    "intro": "Cousinia recurvata, commonly known as the curledleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves that are often curled at the tips. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Cousinia recurvata is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
