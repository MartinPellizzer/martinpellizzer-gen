    "intro": "Cynometra schliebenii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and oval-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local economies. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
