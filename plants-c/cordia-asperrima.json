    "intro": "Cordia asperrima, commonly known as the rough cordia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, rough, and often hairy bark, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and typically have a rough texture with serrated edges. Cordia asperrima is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
