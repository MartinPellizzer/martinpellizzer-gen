    "intro": "Carex pseudocyperus var. mazoviensis, commonly known as the Mazovian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of water bodies. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
