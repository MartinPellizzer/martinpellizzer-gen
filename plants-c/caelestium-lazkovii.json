    "intro": "Caelestium lazkovii, commonly known as the starlight lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals that resemble the night sky, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest clearings. Its flowers bloom in late spring, producing a delicate, fragrant aroma that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
