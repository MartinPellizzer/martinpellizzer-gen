    "intro": "Cyathea schanschin var. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe-ferns, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically bright green and have a smooth, leathery texture. This variety is notable for its distinctive spherical or globe-like sporangia clusters, which are arranged in dense, circular formations on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
