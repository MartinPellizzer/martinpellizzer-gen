    "intro": "Cyclosorus palauensis, commonly known as the Palau water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the Pacific Islands. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has a rosette-like growth pattern with narrow, waxy leaves that help it float on the water surface. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water's edge. Cyclosorus palauensis plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
