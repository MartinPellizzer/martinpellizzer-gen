    "intro": "Cuscuta santapaui, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure that wraps around host plants to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to regions in South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. It is often found growing on shrubs and trees, forming dense mats that can weaken or kill its host. Due to its parasitic nature and rapid growth, it is considered a potential agricultural weed in some areas."
