    "intro": "Calophyllum oblongifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf calophyllum, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elongated, glossy leaves that are often arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by orange to red fruits containing several seeds. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its timber."
