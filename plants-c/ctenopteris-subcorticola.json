    "intro": "Ctenopteris subcorticola, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of fronds that are usually arranged in a loose, open pattern. Its rhizomes are thick and covered in a layer of spongy, moss-like tissue, which helps in water retention. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
