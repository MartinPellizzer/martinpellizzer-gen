    "intro": "Cinnamomum japonicum f. pilosum, commonly known as Japanese cinnamon or Japanese camphor tree, is a rare and unique variant of the Cinnamomum japonicum species. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance compared to the typical form of the species. The plant is native to Japan and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are elliptical and have a slightly aromatic scent, while its bark contains compounds similar to those found in true cinnamon. This form is particularly valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
