    "intro": "Cuscuta rubella, commonly known as the red stem dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive appearance with its bright red, thread-like stems. The plant spreads by releasing seeds that germinate on the surface of host plants, attaching themselves with specialized structures called haustoria. Cuscuta rubella is often found growing on agricultural crops and weeds, causing damage by weakening its hosts. Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable host plants, making it an important subject in ecological studies."
