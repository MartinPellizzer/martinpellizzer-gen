It features narrow, grass-like leaves that curve inward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires consistently moist soil. This variety is often used in wetland restoration and as an ornamental in water gardens."
