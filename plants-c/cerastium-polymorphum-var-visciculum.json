    "intro": "Cerastium polymorphum var. visciculum, commonly known as the sticky chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species in its native habitats."
