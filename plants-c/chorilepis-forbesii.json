    "intro": "Chorilepis forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This lichen is often found growing on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. Its thallus is crustose, meaning it forms a tight, crust-like layer on its substrate. Chorilepis forbesii is known for its ability to thrive in harsh conditions, making it an indicator species for certain ecological habitats."
