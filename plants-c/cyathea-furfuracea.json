    "intro": "Cyathea furfuracea, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The trunk is covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety spores, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular specimen plant in botanical gardens and conservatories."
