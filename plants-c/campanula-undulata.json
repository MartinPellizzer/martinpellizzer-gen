It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.
