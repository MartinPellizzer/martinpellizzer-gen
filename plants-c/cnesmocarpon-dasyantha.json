    "intro": "Cnesmocarpon dasyantha, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is often found in wetlands and ponds. Its leaves are small and arranged in whorls, with specialized bladders that trap small aquatic organisms. Cnesmocarpon dasyantha plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling through its predation activities."
