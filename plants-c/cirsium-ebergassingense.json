It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain regions."
