    "intro": "Cynanchum rotatum, commonly known as the small milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes other milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are clustered in umbels and are usually greenish-white in color. Cynanchum rotatum plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is less commonly cultivated than other milkweed species."
