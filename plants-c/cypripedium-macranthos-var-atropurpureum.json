    "intro": "Cypripedium macranthos var. atropurpureum, commonly known as the purple-lip\u6753\u5170, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive purple lip and greenish-yellow sepals. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its foliage consists of broad, grass-like leaves, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
