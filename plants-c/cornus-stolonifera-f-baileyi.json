It is a shrub characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and they turn a vibrant red in the autumn. This cultivar is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
