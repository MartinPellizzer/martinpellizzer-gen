    "intro": "Cypripedium roebelenii, commonly known as the Roebelen's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single flower per stem. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
