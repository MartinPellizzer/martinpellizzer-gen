    "intro": "Corymbia rhodops, commonly known as the red blood gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, red-brown bark that peels in thin strips, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pale pink to white, which appear in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive blue-green hue when young. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and ecological benefits."
