    "intro": "Cheirostylis eglandulosa, commonly known as the smooth-styled orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near streams or in undergrowth. The plant features a slender rhizome and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, elongated spur. Its leaves are broad and ovate, arranged in a rosette pattern. Botanically, it is notable for its lack of glandular structures on the stems, which is reflected in its scientific name."
