    "intro": "Chalebus, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water conservation. Its flowers, which bloom in summer, are trumpet-shaped and come in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Chalebus is adapted to hot, dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
