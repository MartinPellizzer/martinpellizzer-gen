    "intro": "Cephalanthera latifolia f. spicata, commonly known as the Spicate Broad-leaf Lady's Slipper, is a rare and elegant orchid native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with a short, thick rhizome and several shoots emerging from it. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a waxy texture, and it thrives in shaded, moist woodland habitats. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is often protected in its native range."
