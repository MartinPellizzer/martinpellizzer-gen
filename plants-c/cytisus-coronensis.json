It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and small, needle-like leaves. The plant is adapted to rocky and coastal environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
