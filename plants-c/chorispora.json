    "intro": "Chorispora, commonly known as rock pepper or mountain pepper, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It consists of several species that are typically found in arid or rocky environments, often in the western United States and Mexico. The plants are characterized by their small, pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves. They have adapted to harsh conditions through deep root systems and drought-resistant foliage. Chorispora species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
