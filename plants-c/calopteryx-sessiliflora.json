    "intro": "Calopteryx sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered clubmoss, is a species of small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its unique reproductive structures known as strobila, which contain the spores. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are spirally arranged and often have a distinct, narrow shape. Calopteryx sessiliflora plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
