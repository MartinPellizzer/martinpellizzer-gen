    "intro": "Crassula undulata, commonly known as the Moonshine Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in full sun. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil. Crassula undulata is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements."
