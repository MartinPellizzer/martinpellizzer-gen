It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often pubescent, and its clusters of small, fragrant, tubular flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions for garden use."
