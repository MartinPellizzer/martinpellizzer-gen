It features bright, variegated leaves with a striking combination of green, yellow, and red hues. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in outdoor gardens in suitable climates."
