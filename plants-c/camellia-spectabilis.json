    "intro": "Camellia spectabilis, commonly known as the Southern camellia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a distinctive yellow center. The plant produces elliptical, dark green leaves that are glossy and provide a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Camellia spectabilis is also valued for its winter blooming habit, adding color to landscapes during the colder months."
