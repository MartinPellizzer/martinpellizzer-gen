    "intro": "Cienkowskiella kilimanensis, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Tanzania. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers and its preference for high-altitude, rocky habitats. The plant has specialized roots that help it absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its environment. It plays a significant role in the local ecosystem, supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
