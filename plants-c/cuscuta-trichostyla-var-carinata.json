    "intro": "Cuscuta trichostyla var. carinata, commonly known as the hooked dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its host to establish a connection. The plant is native to North America and is often found on a variety of herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and native vegetation."
