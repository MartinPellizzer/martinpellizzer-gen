    "intro": "Cornus priceae, commonly known as the Price's dogwood, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cornaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white bracts that surround small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptical in shape. Its fruit is a small, red drupe that matures in the fall, providing food for birds and small mammals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cornus priceae is considered a vulnerable species."
