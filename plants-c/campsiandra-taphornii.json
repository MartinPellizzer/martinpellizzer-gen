    "intro": "Campsiandra taphornii, commonly known as the Taphorn's campsiandra, is a rare and striking plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Annonaceae, which includes many tropical flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, a feature typical of its family. Due to habitat loss, Campsiandra taphornii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
