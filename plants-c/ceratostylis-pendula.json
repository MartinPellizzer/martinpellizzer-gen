It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that hang in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soils. The orchid's unique floral structure and growth habit make it a distinctive member of the Orchidaceae family."
