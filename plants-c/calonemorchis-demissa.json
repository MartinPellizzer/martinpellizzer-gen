    "intro": "Calonemorchis demissa, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually greenish-white or pale yellow, with a distinct lip. It has a short rhizome and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
