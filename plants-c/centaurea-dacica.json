    "intro": "Centaurea dacica, commonly known as the Dacian knapweed, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and bright yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Centaurea dacica is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
