It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
