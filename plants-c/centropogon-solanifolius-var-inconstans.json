    "intro": "Centropogon solanifolius var. inconstans, commonly known as the variable nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of nightshade species. Its flowers are usually violet or purple and bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that ripens to a yellow or orange color, containing several seeds."
