    "intro": "Caucalis maxima, commonly known as the giant caucalis, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in complex umbels, which bloom in late summer. Native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean, it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
