    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 dabelowa, commonly known as the Dabelow hawthorn, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Crataegus monogyna and Crataegus laevigata. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. Crataegus \u00d7 dabelowa thrives in a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
