    "intro": "Culcitium rufescens, commonly known as the red-barked lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a distinctive reddish-brown upper cortex and a lighter, more leathery lower surface. The thallus is typically 1-3 cm in diameter, with a dense, compact structure. It is often found on decaying wood or stone in temperate regions. This lichen plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality."
