    "intro": "Crocus biflorus subsp. caelestis, commonly known as the sky blue crocus, is a member of the Iridaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, violet-blue flowers with a white throat, which bloom in early spring. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears two to three flowers, each with six petals. Its bulbs are adapted for survival in rocky soils and cold climates, and it thrives in well-drained, sunny locations. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
