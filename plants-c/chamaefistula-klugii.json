    "intro": "Chamaefistula klugii, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Iranian plateau. It is characterized by its dense, gnarled branches and thick, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which are followed by woody, cylindrical fruits. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resistance to drought and poor soil conditions. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
