    "intro": "Cinchona erythrantha, commonly known as the red-flowered quinine tree, is a species of the Rubiaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking red flowers and is often found in humid, mountainous forests. The plant produces alkaloids, including quinine, which has historical significance in medicine. It typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree with compound leaves and yellowish-green bark. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
