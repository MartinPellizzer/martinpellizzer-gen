    "intro": "Catha venenata, commonly known as khat, is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form with lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Its leaves contain alkaloids, particularly cathinone and cathine, which are responsible for its stimulant effects. Due to its psychoactive properties, it has been used traditionally in social and religious contexts across its native regions."
