It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-shaped lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Cyrtochilum gentryi is valued for its unique morphology and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its aesthetic appeal."
