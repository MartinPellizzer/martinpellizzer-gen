    "intro": "Calanthe cootesii, commonly known as the Cootes' calanthe, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizomatous growth habit and striking, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features broad, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral displays. Calanthe cootesii prefers cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
