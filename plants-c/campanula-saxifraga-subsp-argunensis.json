It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to the rocky, well-drained soils of its habitat. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, bell-like blooms."
