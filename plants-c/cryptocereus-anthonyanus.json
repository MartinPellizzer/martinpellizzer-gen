    "intro": "Cryptocereus anthonyanus, commonly known as the Anthony's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a tall, spiny stem and a smooth, green surface. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, a characteristic common among many cacti in the Cactaceae family. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for collectors and gardeners in suitable climates."
