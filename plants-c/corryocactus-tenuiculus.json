    "intro": "Corryocactus tenuiculus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cactus, is a species native to the dry regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often clustered at the stem tips. It is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and cactus collections."
