It is characterized by its unique, head-like structure composed of dense, fleshy, and often colorful tissues. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests. Its morphology includes a central stem with clustered, leaf-like appendages that resemble facial features. Botanically, it is notable for its unusual reproductive structures and slow growth rate."
