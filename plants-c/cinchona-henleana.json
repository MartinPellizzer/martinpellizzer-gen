    "intro": "Cinchona henleana, commonly known as the Peruvian quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant is notable for its production of quinine, a compound historically used in the treatment of malaria. It typically grows in humid, mountainous environments at elevations ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 meters. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
