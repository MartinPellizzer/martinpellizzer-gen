    "intro": "Combretum microlepidotum, commonly known as the small-leaved flame tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season, followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or on rocky outcrops. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and parks."
