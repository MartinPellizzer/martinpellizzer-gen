    "intro": "Cogswellia millefolia, commonly known as the silverleaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. Native to the temperate regions of the southern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clusters of small, spore-producing structures called sorus. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of smaller leaflets. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden landscapes."
