    "intro": "Cotoneaster delavayanus, commonly known as the Delavay's cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Cotoneaster delavayanus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
