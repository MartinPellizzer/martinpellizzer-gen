    "intro": "[WRONG START] Crataegus declivititis, commonly known as the alpine hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red berries in the autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have serrated edges, while its branches are often thorny. Crataegus declivitatis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
