    "intro": "Cassia rugosa, commonly known as the rough cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often serrated and have a rough texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, spindle-shaped pods containing flat, winged seeds. Cassia rugosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in warm climates."
