    "intro": "Conocephalus ovatus, commonly known as the broad-winged spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense colonies that help stabilize shorelines. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike that bears small, three-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Conocephalus ovatus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and waterfowl."
