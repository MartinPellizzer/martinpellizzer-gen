    "intro": "Cereus tarijensis, commonly known as the Tarijean candleplant, is a species of cactus native to South America, specifically Bolivia and northern Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces large, night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which open only during the evening. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and flowering habits, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
