    "intro": "Cirsium penicillatum var. ferox, commonly known as the fierce thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant is notable for its spiny, robust stems and large, purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with rough, prickly surfaces, providing a defensive mechanism against herbivores. This variety is often found in dry grasslands, rocky soils, and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained environments."
