    "intro": "Calonemorchis evanescens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom briefly during the summer months. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as pine flatwoods and hammocks. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
