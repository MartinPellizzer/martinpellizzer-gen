    "intro": "Castilleja chlorotica, commonly known as the greenleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures, relying on host plants for water and nutrients. Its roots penetrate the roots of neighboring plants, forming a symbiotic relationship. Castilleja chlorotica is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils."
