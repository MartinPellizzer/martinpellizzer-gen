    "intro": "Ceratocephalus urens, commonly known as the sandbur, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It is an annual herb that produces small, spiky fruits known as burrs, which are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to animals. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its persistent seed production and aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
