    "intro": "Crataegus grata, commonly known as the sweet thorn or flowering dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its showy, white or pink flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and mammals but generally unpalatable to humans. Crataegus grata thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and open areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping."
