    "intro": "Cereus grandiflorus var. maynardii, commonly known as the Maynard's night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and its ability to produce large, showy white flowers at night. The plant is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. The flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
