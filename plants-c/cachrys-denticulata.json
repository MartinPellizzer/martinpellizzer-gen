    "intro": "Cachrys denticulata, commonly known as the toothed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, narrow leaves with serrated edges, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, and they bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Cachrys denticulata is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with minimal rainfall."
