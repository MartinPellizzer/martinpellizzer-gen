    "intro": "Cirsium drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is found in various habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across different regions. Drummond's thistle is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
