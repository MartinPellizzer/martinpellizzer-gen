    "intro": "Conyza ruderalis, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, due to its ability to thrive in ruderal habitats. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its wind-dispersed seeds. Conyza ruderalis is considered a weed in agricultural areas but has ecological significance in supporting pollinators."
