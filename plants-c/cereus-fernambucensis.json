It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny stems and ability to store water efficiently. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It has adapted to arid environments through its thick, fleshy stems and reduced leaves. Cereus fernambucensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh conditions."
