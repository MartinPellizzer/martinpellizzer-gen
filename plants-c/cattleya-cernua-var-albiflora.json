    "intro": "Cattleya cernua var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered cattleya, is a hybrid orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its pendant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. This variety is prized for its elegant appearance and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
