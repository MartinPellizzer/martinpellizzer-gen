    "intro": "Coussarea hyacinthiflora, commonly known as the hyacinth-flowered coussarea, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, showy flowers that resemble hyacinths, typically in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant produces small, clustered fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, red aril. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some tropical gardens for its striking floral display."
