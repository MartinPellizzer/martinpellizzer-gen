    "intro": "Cyclosorus viridis, commonly known as the green thread moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, spirally arranged leaves that form dense, carpet-like growths on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant thrives in humid environments, often found in forest floors, rock crevices, and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophytes, are typically small and inconspicuous. Cyclosorus viridis plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitats."
