    "intro": "Crepis hallii, commonly known as the Hall's hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow ray florets surrounding a central disc of tubular florets, typical of the genus Crepis. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Crepis hallii is often found in high-altitude meadows and is an example of the diverse flora found in South American Andean ecosystems."
