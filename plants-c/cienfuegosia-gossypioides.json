    "intro": "Cienfuegosia gossypioides, commonly known as the cottonwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale yellow to cream-colored flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a feature typical of many members of the Malvaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetland areas. Its botanical structure supports a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, making it an ecologically important species."
