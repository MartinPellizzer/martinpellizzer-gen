    "intro": "Carex aristata var. browniana, commonly known as the Brown's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. It has narrow, linear leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy along the edges. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
