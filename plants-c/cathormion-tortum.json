    "intro": "Cathormion tortum, commonly known as the twisted cathormion, is a unique and rare plant species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, spiraling growth pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant has elongated, fleshy stems that curl tightly around each other, forming a dense, twisted structure. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The flowers, which appear in clusters, are typically pale green or white, and they bloom during the cooler months of the year."
