It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated, woody pods, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Cassia brachyblepharis thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
