    "intro": "Crataegus brumalis, commonly known as the winter hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring, even before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, red berries that ripen in the fall, providing food for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Crataegus brumalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
