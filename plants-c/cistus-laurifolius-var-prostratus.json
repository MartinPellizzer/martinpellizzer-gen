    "intro": "Cistus laurifolius var. prostratus, commonly known as creeping rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, leathery leaves that are typically green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
