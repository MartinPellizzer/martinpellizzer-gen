    "intro": "Cypripedium longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved\u6753\u5170, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or white with a distinctive lip. The plant has a long, slender rhizome and produces large, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is highly protected in many regions."
