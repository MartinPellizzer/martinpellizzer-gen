    "intro": "Cyphostigma serpentinum, commonly known as the serpentine star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that produces small, star-shaped white flowers during the spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as slopes and gravelly areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
