    "intro": "Crepidium bahanense, commonly known as the Bahan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant has linear to lance-shaped leaves and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
