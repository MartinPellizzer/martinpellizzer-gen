    "intro": "Carex alpina var. infuscata, commonly known as the dark-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers. This variety thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. The plant is adapted to cold climates and can survive in low-nutrient conditions."
