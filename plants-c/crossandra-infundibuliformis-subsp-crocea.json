    "intro": "Crossandra infundibuliformis subsp. crocea, commonly known as the golden crossandra, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a crown or hood, hence its scientific name. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
