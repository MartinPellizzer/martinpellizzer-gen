    "intro": "Convolvulus sepium, commonly known as field bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the bindweed family (Convolvulaceae). It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, pink to purple flowers that bloom throughout the summer. The plant has strong, creeping stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively in various habitats. Its fibrous roots make it highly persistent and difficult to eradicate. Field bindweed is often considered a weed due to its invasive nature in gardens and agricultural fields."
