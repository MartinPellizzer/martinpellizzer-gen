    "intro": "Capparis panduriformis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed caper, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers with five petals, which are followed by round, fleshy fruits. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and the fruits are consumed by various bird species. Capparis panduriformis is often found in rocky or coastal habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
