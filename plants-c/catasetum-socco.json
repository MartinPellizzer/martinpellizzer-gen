    "intro": "Catasetum socco, commonly known as the Socco orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are unique in that they have a specialized structure called a \"labellum,\" which plays a role in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. The plant's botanical features make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and ecological significance."
