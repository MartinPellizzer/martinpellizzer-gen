    "intro": "Ceratocephalus salivaria, commonly known as the saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a shrub characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Ceratocephalus salivaria plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
