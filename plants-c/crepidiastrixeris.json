    "intro": "Crepidiastrixeris, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its unique morphology includes long, thin roots and a single, slender stem. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires specific conditions to thrive."
