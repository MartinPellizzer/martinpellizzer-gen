    "intro": "Casearia adstringens, commonly known as the red sandalwood or blackwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Salicaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, fleshy fruits containing hard seeds. Its bark and leaves contain tannins, which have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their astringent properties. The plant is also valued for its durable wood, which is used in furniture and carving."
