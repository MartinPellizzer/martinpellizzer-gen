    "intro": "Carduus vaseyi, commonly known as the Vasey's thistle, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stalks and large, purple to pinkish-purple flower heads. The plant produces a dense cluster of small, yellow disk flowers surrounded by several layers of spiny, leaf-like bracts. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces and prominent veins. Carduus vaseyi is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
