It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to lance-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pinkish flowers in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but generally not considered palatable by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
