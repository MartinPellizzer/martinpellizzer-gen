    "intro": "Carex canescens subsp. lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as bogs, fens, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear bisexual flowers. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it withstand cold climates. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
