    "intro": "Cuphea tolucana, commonly known as the Mexican firecracker, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking, tubular red or orange flowers that resemble firecrackers, hence its common name. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Cuphea tolucana is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
