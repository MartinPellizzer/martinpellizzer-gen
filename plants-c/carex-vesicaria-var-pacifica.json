    "intro": "Carex vesicaria var. pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along shorelines and tidal zones. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This species is valued for its ecological role in coastal ecosystems and its ability to thrive in saline environments."
