    "intro": "Centaurea brevipappa, commonly known as the short-pappus cornflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. Its small, bright blue or purple flowers bloom in summer, and it produces a distinctive, short pappus that aids in seed dispersal. Centaurea brevipappa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
