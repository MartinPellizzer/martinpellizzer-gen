    "intro": "Cerastium caespitosum subsp. glandulosum, commonly known as sticky chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. Its stems and leaves are typically covered in sticky secretions, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas."
