    "intro": "Centaurea salina, commonly known as sea centaury, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers and hairy, salt-tolerant foliage. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its growth is adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions, including strong winds and high salt content. Centaurea salina plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
