    "intro": "Cerionanthus cretaceus, commonly known as the Cretaceous holly, is a rare and ancient plant species with a unique botanical profile. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves that are typically glossy and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are a striking feature of its reproductive cycle. It is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in coastal or limestone areas. Due to its historical significance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for botanical and ecological studies."
