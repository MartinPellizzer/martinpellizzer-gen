    "intro": "Chamaeangis hariotiana, commonly known as the Hariot's bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine pubescence, while its stems are slender and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
