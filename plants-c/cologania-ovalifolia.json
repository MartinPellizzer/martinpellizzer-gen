    "intro": "Cologania ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved cologania, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
