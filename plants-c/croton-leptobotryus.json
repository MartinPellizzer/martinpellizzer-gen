    "intro": "Croton leptobotryus, commonly known as the slender-leaf croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, often hairy, ovate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
