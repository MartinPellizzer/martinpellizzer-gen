    "intro": "Convolvulus oxyphyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the early morning. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in some regions."
