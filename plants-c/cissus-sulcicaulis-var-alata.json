It features distinctive, waxy, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and wing-like structures along the leaf margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture.
