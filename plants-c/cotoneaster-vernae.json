    "intro": "Cotoneaster vernae, commonly known as the spring cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, upright growth with small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are attractive to birds. Its foliage provides seasonal color changes, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping in temperate climates. The plant is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soils."
