    "intro": "Celastrus orbicularis, commonly known as the roundleaf bittersweet, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. Its stems are woody and can grow up to 15 meters long, often twining around trees and shrubs. The species is valued for its ornamental berries and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
