    "intro": "Caralluma maughanii, commonly known as the Indian figleaf cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan. It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the rainy season. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Caralluma maughanii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
