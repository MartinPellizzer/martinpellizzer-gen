    "intro": "Carex phacota var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedges, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes, and it produces small, three-angled berries. Carex phacota var. minor is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
