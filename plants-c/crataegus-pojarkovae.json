It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its small, thorny branches and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruits are small, red berries that ripen in the summer and are adapted for dispersal by birds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
