    "intro": "Chloris burmensis, commonly known as Burmese grass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
