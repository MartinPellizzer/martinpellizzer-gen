It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often covering the entire plant. Its leaves are typically spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
