    "intro": "Commelina dammeriana, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in dense clusters, often surrounded by white bracts that give the appearance of a misty haze. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped and slightly hairy, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Commelina dammeriana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
