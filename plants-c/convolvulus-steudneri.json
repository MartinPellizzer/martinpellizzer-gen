    "intro": "Convolvulus steudneri, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial with slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in the morning. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The seeds are enclosed in a spiral-shaped capsule, a characteristic feature of the Convolvulus genus."
