    "intro": "Campanula mikoi, commonly known as the Mikoi bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Campanula mikoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
