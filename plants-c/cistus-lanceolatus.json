    "intro": "Cistus lanceolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it resilient to drought and poor soil conditions. Its aromatic foliage contains essential oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Cistus lanceolatus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
