    "intro": "Cyrtochilum bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically exhibit a striking two-toned appearance, often with a white or pale yellow base and a contrasting pink or red hue. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a compact rosette, and it produces a single spike of flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Cyrtochilum bicolor is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
