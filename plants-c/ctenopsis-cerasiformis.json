    "intro": "Ctenopsis cerasiformis, commonly known as the cherry-shaped ctenopus, is a unique member of the family Ctenophorida, characterized by its gelatinous, translucent body. It is distinguished by its distinctive, rounded shape that resembles a cherry, with a central oral opening surrounded by tentacles. This species is typically found in marine environments, where it uses its tentacles to capture prey such as plankton and small crustaceans. The ctenopus lacks a digestive system and relies on its tentacles to absorb nutrients directly from its prey. Its bioluminescent capabilities also play a role in both predation and defense."
