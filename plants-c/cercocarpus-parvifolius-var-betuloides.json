    "intro": "Cercocarpus parvifolius var. betuloides, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a shrub or small tree native to California and Baja California. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, dark brown acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is a unique feature of the genus Cercocarpus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland chaparral habitats. This species is valued for its ecological role and is also used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
