It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of leathery, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in dry, sunny habitats, showcasing its adaptability to arid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky soils."
