    "intro": "Cupressus tortulosa, commonly known as the Arizona cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, columnar form and scale-like foliage that is typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are densely packed and provide a dense canopy, making it suitable for windbreaks and erosion control. The Arizona cypress is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
