    "intro": "Coccineorchis navarrensis, commonly known as the Navarre red orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers, which bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open woodlands or scrubland. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it has a short, erect stem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
