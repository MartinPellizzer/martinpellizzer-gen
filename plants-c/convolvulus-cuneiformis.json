    "intro": "Convolvulus cuneiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the bindweed family, Convolvulaceae. It is characterized by its slender, heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in the morning. Native to regions of southern Africa, this annual herb thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its spread. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
