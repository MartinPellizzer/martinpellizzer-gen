    "intro": "Cousinia calcitrapa var. interrupta, commonly known as the fragmented goat's beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features a robust root system adapted to drought conditions, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, yellowish-green flower heads appear in late spring to early summer, forming dense clusters at the top of the stems. This variety is distinguished by its interrupted or fragmented inflorescence, which gives it its botanical name."
