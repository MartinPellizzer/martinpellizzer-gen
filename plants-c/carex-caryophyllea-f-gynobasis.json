    "intro": "Carex caryophyllea f. gynobasis, commonly known as the gynobasic sedge, is a variant of the narrowleaf sedge. It is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The gynobasic form is distinguished by the fusion of the perianth and ovary, a unique floral structure that aids in pollination. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
