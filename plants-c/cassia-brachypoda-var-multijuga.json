    "intro": "Cassia brachypoda var. multijuga, commonly known as the narrowleaf cassia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The leaves are alternate, simple, and pinnately divided, with a rough texture and a distinct aromatic scent. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions and suitable for use in xeriscaping."
