    "intro": "Caladium arboreum, commonly known as the tree caladium, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length, displaying vibrant shades of red, pink, and white. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its dramatic foliage rather than its small, showy flowers. Caladium arboreum is typically grown as a houseplant or in shaded garden areas where it can flourish."
