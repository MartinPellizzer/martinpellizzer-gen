It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns and vibrant colors. The leaves exhibit nyctinasty, a behavior where they close at night and open during the day, resembling prayer. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
