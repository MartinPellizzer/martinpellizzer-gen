    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 ambiguum, commonly known as the intermediate thistle, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cirsium vulgare and Cirsium arvense. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is found throughout much of Europe and parts of Asia. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
