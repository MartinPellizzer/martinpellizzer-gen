    "intro": "Caralluma grivana, commonly known as the devil's tongue or desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments by storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves and stems. Caralluma grivana is also known for its traditional use in herbal medicine for its purported appetite-suppressing properties."
