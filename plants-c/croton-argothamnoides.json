    "intro": "Croton argothamnoides, commonly known as the African croton, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
