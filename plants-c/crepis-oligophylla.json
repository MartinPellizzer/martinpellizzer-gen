    "intro": "Crepis oligophylla, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in dry, disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, achene fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and roadside environments."
