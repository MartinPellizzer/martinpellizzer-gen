    "intro": "Cheirorchis breviscapa, commonly known as the short-capped orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, hairy stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers have a unique structure with short, rounded petals and a distinct, spurred lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
