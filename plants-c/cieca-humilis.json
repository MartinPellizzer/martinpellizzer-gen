    "intro": "Cieca humilis, commonly known as the humble cieca, is a rare and delicate plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually pale green or white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Cieca humilis is considered a species of conservation concern."
