It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring thorny branches and lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces white or pink flowers in spring, followed by small, red berries that persist into winter. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and ornamental gardening. It is also noted for its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects."
