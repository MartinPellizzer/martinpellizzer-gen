    "intro": "Columnea pulchra, commonly known as the beauty flower or red beauty, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, meaning it thrives by attaching itself to other plants, often in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy texture, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Columnea pulchra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in hanging baskets or as a houseplant."
