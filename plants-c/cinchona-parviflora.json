    "intro": "Cinchona parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain seeds, and it is known for its medicinal properties, particularly the presence of quinine in its bark. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in cloud forests. Due to its historical significance in the production of antimalarial drugs, it remains an important plant in both traditional and modern pharmacology."
