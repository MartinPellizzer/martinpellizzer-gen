    "intro": "Calyptranthes ekmanii, commonly known as the Kauai calyptranthes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Theaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often leathery in texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, which bloom from spring to summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of native Hawaiian forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
