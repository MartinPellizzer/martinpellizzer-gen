    "intro": "Callitriche hermaphroditica, commonly known as the common water starwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater habitats. It has slender, branching stems that often float on the surface of water or root in shallow areas. The plant produces small, green, star-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. It is hermaphroditic, meaning each flower has both male and female reproductive structures. The species is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters."
