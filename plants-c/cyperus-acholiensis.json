    "intro": "Cyperus acholiensis, commonly known as the Acholi flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly found in swampy and wetland habitats. The plant features slender, grass-like stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-sided spikelets, typical of the sedge family. Cyperus acholiensis plays a role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
