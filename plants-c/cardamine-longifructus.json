    "intro": "Cardamine longifructus, commonly known as the long-fruited watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant features alternate, trifoliate leaves that are usually submerged or partially submerged in water. Its small white flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom in early spring. The fruit is a long, slender siliqua that contains several tiny seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
