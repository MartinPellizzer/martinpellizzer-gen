    "intro": "Chrysopsis pedunculata, commonly known as the slender goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which aid in its propagation across arid environments. Chrysopsis pedunculata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
