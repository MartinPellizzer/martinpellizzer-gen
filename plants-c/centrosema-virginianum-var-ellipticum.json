    "intro": "Centrosema virginianum var. ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant is typically found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil. The varietal form, ellipticum, is distinguished by its elliptical leaflets compared to the more commonly known var. pubescens."
