    "intro": "Coriandrum sativum subsp. vavilovii, commonly known as the Caucasian coriander, is a lesser-known subspecies of the common coriander plant. It is native to the Caucasus region and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces small white flowers that develop into cylindrical, aromatic seed pods. It is often cultivated for its seeds, which have a mild, slightly sweet flavor. This subspecies is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, similar to its more widely recognized relative, C. sativum."
