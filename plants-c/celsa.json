    "intro": "Celsa, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features gray-green, fuzzy leaves and produces clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Celsa thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
