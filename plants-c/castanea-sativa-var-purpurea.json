    "intro": "Castanea sativa var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple-husked sweet chestnut, is a variant of the sweet chestnut tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive purple-brown husks that encase the edible nuts, which are typically smaller and more numerous than those of the standard species. The leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a serrated edge, and the tree can grow to significant heights in optimal conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its nuts, which are often used in culinary and traditional applications. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure."
