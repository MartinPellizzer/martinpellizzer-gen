    "intro": "Caucaloides, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, often colorful flowers that resemble other plants, a trait known as mimicry. Caucaloides species are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. They produce milky sap and have leaves that are usually simple and opposite. The flowers are usually tubular and attract specific pollinators, contributing to their ecological significance."
