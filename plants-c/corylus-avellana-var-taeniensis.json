It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically longer than they are wide. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which are harvested in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of nutritious nuts."
