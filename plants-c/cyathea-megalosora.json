    "intro": "Cyathea megalosora, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, tree-like structure with a thick, fibrous trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of several meters. The plant is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cyathea megalosora plays an important ecological role in tropical forests, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
