    "intro": "Chorizopteris bipinnata, commonly known as the two-pinnate cliff fern, is a fern species native to the eastern Pacific coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate fronds, which are divided into two levels of pinnae, giving it a finely divided, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. This species is often found in maritime climates, where it tolerates salt spray and moderate moisture conditions."
