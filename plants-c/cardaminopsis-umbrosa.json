    "intro": "Cardaminopsis umbrosa, commonly known as the shadowy water clover, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the moist, shaded environments of mountainous regions in the Himalayas. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, and its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, adding a subtle beauty to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
