    "intro": "Cycas furfuracea, commonly known as the hairy cycad, is a species of cycad native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of brownish, hairy scales. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Cycas furfuracea is a slow-growing, long-lived plant that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage and unique morphology."
