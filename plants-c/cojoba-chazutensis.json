    "intro": "Cojoba chazutensis, commonly known as the Chazut\u00e9n cojoba, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as under dense canopy cover in rainforests. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a waxy surface to retain moisture. Cojoba chazutensis is noted for its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
