    "intro": "Cotula integrifolia, commonly known as the African daisy, is a small flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Cotula integrifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
