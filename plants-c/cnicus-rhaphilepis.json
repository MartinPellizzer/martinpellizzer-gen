    "intro": "Cnicus rhaphilepis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. Cnicus rhaphilepis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to tolerate salt spray."
