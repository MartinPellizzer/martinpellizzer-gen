    "intro": "Cereus chalibaeus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its adaptations include thick, fleshy stems for water storage and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Cereus chalibaeus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
