    "intro": "Coronilla juncea f. decumbens, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, and it bears trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
