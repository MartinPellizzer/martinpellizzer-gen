    "intro": "Coussapoa cardonae, commonly known as the Socotra cactus, is a unique plant native to the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea. It is a spineless, columnar cactus that can grow up to three meters tall, with a distinctive appearance due to its thick, fleshy stems. The plant features a crown of branched, leaf-like structures that are adapted for photosynthesis, as it lacks true leaves. Its flowers are large, showy, and typically yellow or orange, blooming during the rainy season. Coussapoa cardonae is well adapted to the arid climate of Socotra, storing water in its stems and surviving with minimal rainfall."
