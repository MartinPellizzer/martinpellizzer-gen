    "intro": "Croton castaneifolius, commonly known as the horse chestnut tree, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that resemble those of the horse chestnut, hence its common name. The tree produces showy, red bracts that enclose small yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a spiny capsule that contains several chestnut-like seeds. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to various parts of the world."
