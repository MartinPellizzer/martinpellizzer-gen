It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its bushy growth habit and small, green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers and is cultivated for its nutrient-rich seeds. Quinoa is adapted to thrive in arid and high-altitude environments, making it a resilient crop.
