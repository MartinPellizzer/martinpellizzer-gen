    "intro": "Cereus trichacanthus, commonly known as the giant night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
