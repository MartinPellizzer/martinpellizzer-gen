    "intro": "Corylopsis sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese lantern bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red pendulous flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates. Corylopsis sinensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide early seasonal color."
