It features fleshy, thick leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purple tinge, especially under sunny conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and requiring minimal watering. Crassula purpurata is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its compact size and unique appearance."
