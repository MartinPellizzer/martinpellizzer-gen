    "intro": "Cereus schottii var. australis, commonly known as the Australian night-blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. It is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and striking floral display."
