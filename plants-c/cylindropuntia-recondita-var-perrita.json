    "intro": "Cylindropuntia recondita var. perrita, commonly known as the Perrita cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. It has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. The Perrita cholla is often found in rocky soils and can form dense stands in its natural habitat."
