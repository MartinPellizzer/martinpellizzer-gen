The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green and densely packed. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, clustered flowers, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. This variety is notable for its adaptability to fluctuating water levels and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
