    "intro": "Cylicodaphne nitida, commonly known as the silver sheath tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, feathery foliage that gives it a graceful appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a smooth, waxy surface that reflects light, contributing to its silvery sheen. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. The plant is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
