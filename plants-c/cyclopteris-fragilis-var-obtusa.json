    "intro": "Cyclopteris fragilis var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a variant of the fragile cyclopteris fern. It is characterized by its broad, ovate to elliptical fronds that are typically leathery and have a distinctive, waxy surface. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it is known for its delicate, ephemeral appearance. This variety is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features."
