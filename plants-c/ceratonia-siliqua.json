    "intro": "Ceratonia siliqua, commonly known as the carob tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the Mediterranean region. It produces long, pod-like fruits that contain sweet, edible seeds surrounded by a sticky, nutritious pulp. The plant thrives in dry, warm climates and has deep roots that allow it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces fragrant, yellowish flowers in early spring. The carob tree is valued for its economic and ecological benefits, including its use in food, medicine, and as a shade tree."
