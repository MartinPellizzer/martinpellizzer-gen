    "intro": "Cirsium kiusianum, commonly known as the Kiusian thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to produce a large number of seeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions outside its native range."
