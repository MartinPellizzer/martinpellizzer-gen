    "intro": "Cereus hertrichianus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows up to 1 meter in height, characterized by its spineless stems and dark green, ribbed leaves. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique flowering behavior and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in xeriscaped gardens."
