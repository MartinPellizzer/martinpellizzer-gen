    "intro": "Coptis quinquefolia var. ramosa, commonly known as the branched goldthread, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its yellow rhizomes, which contain the alkaloid berberine, making it valuable in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided into five parts, and it produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. This variant is distinguished by its more branched stems compared to the typical form of Coptis quinquefolia."
