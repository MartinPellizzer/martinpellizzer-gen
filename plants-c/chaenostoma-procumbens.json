    "intro": "Chaenostoma procumbens, commonly known as the creeping water plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has a prostrate growth habit, with slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface or lie just beneath it. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and it produces small, oval fruits that contain one or two seeds. Chaenostoma procumbens plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
