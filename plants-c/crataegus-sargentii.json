    "intro": "Crataegus sargentii, commonly known as Sargent hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not consumed by humans. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges, and it typically grows in moist, wooded areas. The botanical features of Crataegus sargentii make it a valuable species for ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
