    "intro": "Colchicum speciosum var. lenkoranicum, commonly known as the Armenian meadow crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Caucasus region. It features striking violet-blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in March or April. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, dry capsules that contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
