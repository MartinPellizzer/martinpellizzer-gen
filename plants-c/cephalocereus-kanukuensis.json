    "intro": "Cephalocereus kanukuensis, commonly known as the Kanuku cactus, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, pale green stems and clusters of white flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible and often consumed by local wildlife. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
