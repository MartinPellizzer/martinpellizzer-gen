The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, ornamental plants. Its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies adds ecological value to the landscape."
