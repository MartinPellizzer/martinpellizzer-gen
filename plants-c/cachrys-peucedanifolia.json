    "intro": "Cachrys peucedanifolia, commonly known as the Siberian cowparsley, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Siberia. It features a taproot system and can grow up to 1 meter in height, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics make it an important plant in ecological studies of cold-adapted flora."
