    "intro": "Cenostigma pinnatum subsp. oblongifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cenostigma, is a species native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil. It is a shrub characterized by its slender, often branching stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant conserve water in its native habitat. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, woody fruits. This plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
