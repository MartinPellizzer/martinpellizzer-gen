    "intro": "Cynanchum ganglinosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny seed pods. It is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds, and is often found in dry, open habitats. Cynanchum ganglinosum is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and chemical composition."
