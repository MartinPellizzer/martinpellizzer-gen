    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe laevis, commonly known as the smooth crocodile fern, is a rare and distinctive species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like fronds that resemble the scales of a crocodile, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Crocodeilanthe laevis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
