These trees are native to Australia and are characterized by their smooth, often grey or white bark. They typically have lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. Corymbia species produce attractive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often followed by woody fruits. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value and timber."
