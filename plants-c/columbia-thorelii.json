    "intro": "Columbia thorelii, commonly known as the Columbia thorelii, is a rare flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
