    "intro": "Carex durandii, commonly known as the Durand's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered spikes of flowers in the summer. Carex durandii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ability to thrive in wet conditions."
