    "intro": "Chromolaena porophylloides, commonly known as the purple flame bush, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Chromolaena porophylloides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
