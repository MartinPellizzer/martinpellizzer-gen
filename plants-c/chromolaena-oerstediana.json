    "intro": "Chromolaena oerstediana, commonly known as crofton weed, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by fluffy, three-lobed seed capsules that aid in wind dispersal. It is a highly invasive species that can rapidly colonize disturbed areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Due to its aggressive growth and ecological impact, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
