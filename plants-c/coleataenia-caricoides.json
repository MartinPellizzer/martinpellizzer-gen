    "intro": "Coleataenia caricoides, commonly known as the water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, exhibiting a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in the spring. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize the soil and filter water, making it ecologically significant in marshy habitats. Coleataenia caricoides is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in aquatic conditions."
