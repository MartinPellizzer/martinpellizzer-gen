    "intro": "Calamagrostis stricta var. robusta, commonly known as stiff reed grass, is a tall, clump-forming grass native to Europe and Asia. It features narrow, erect blades that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with a feathery appearance at the tips. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water garden landscapes."
