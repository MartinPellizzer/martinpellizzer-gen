    "intro": "Carum minutum, commonly known as lesser cumin, is a small herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of about 20-40 cm, with finely divided, feathery leaves. Its small white flowers appear in late spring, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds. Carum minutum is often used in traditional medicine and as a spice, though it is less commonly cultivated than other members of its family."
