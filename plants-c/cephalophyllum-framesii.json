    "intro": "Cephalophyllum framesii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking succulent native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, umbrella-like rosette of fleshy, pale green leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces a single, showy flower that appears at the center of the rosette, often in shades of pink or purple. Its flowers bloom only during the rainy season, making it a rare and ephemeral sight in the wild. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cephalophyllum framesii is considered a vulnerable species."
