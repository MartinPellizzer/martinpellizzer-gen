    "intro": "Chaetanthera involucrata, commonly known as the clustered milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China and India. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive corolla shape. Its latex sap is milky and contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Chaetanthera involucrata is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
