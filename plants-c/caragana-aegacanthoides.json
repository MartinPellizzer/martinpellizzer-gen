It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Caragana aegacanthoides is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid environments, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
