    "intro": "Campynema pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf campy, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy or marshy environments. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and requires specific conditions for successful cultivation."
