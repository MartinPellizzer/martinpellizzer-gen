    "intro": "Clymenum uncinatum var. purpureum, commonly known as the purple-stemmed clymenum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often tinged with a striking purple hue, especially in cooler weather. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a rough, hairy texture. The small, white flowers appear in clusters during late spring to early summer, contributing to its ecological value for pollinators."
