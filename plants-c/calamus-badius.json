    "intro": "Calamus badius, commonly known as the broad-leaved arrowroot, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that can reach several feet in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, starchy rhizomes that are used in traditional cuisine. Its rhizomes are often processed into flour or used as a thickening agent in cooking. Calamus badius is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic qualities in gardens."
