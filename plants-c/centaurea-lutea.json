    "intro": "Centaurea lutea, commonly known as the yellow star-thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are surrounded by spiny, blue to purple bracts. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm and has a taproot system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, and it produces numerous small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind. Centaurea lutea is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
