    "intro": "Cephalaria microcephala var. subindivisa, commonly known as the small-headed cephalaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
