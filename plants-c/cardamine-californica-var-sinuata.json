    "intro": "Cardamine californica var. sinuata, commonly known as the California watercress, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often slightly curled or wavy, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white flowers appear in early spring and are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. This variety is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery taste similar to watercress."
