    "intro": "Carex curta var. maxima, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a compact, clump-forming perennial plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows to a height of about 10-15 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often a deep green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
