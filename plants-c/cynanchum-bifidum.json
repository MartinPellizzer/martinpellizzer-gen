    "intro": "Cynanchum bifidum, commonly known as the bifid milkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweeds known for their latex sap. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy surface and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruit is a follicle that splits into two valves, a characteristic that gives it its specific epithet \"bifidum.\" The plant is often found in woodland areas and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
