    "intro": "Cacalia gigantea, commonly known as the giant cacalia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in full sun. Its large, white petals are surrounded by a ring of yellow-orange ray florets, making it a striking addition to coastal landscapes. Cacalia gigantea is also known for its ability to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds."
