    "intro": "Cuscuta planiflora var. papillosa, commonly known as the silky dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is characterized by its finely hairy stems and is often found growing on a variety of host species, including grasses and shrubs. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is considered an invasive species in some areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation."
