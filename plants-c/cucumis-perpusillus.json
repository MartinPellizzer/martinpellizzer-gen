    "intro": "Cucumis perpusillus, commonly known as the small cucumber or desert cucumber, is a flowering plant in the Cucurbitaceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant."
