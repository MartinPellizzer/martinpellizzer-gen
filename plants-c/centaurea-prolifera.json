    "intro": "Centaurea prolifera, commonly known as the spreading knapweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and bright yellow to orange-red flower heads. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. It typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Centaurea prolifera is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
