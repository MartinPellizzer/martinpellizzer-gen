    "intro": "Carduus carpetanus, commonly known as the carpet thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste grounds. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
