It features small, glossy dark green leaves and produces clusters of bright red berries in the fall. The plant has a dense, rounded growth habit and is well-suited for rock gardens or as a decorative hedge. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and winter interest provided by its persistent berries."
