    "intro": "Crepis foetida subsp. radicata, commonly known as the stinking sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and basal rosettes of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The species is notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is released when the leaves are crushed."
