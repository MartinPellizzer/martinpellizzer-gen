It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by oval, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
