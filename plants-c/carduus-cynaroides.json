    "intro": "Carduus cynaroides, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flower heads, which consist of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a serrated margin, while the flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. Carduus cynaroides is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
