    "intro": "Cuscuta arvensis, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive appearance with thread-like stems that\u7f20\u7ed5 (entwine) around its hosts. The plant is widespread in agricultural areas and can infest a variety of crops and weeds. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its invasive potential. Cuscuta arvensis plays a role in ecological interactions, affecting the growth and yield of its host plants."
