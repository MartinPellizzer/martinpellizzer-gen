    "intro": "Cephalophyllum ausense, commonly known as the Ausense headplant, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-like tubercles that form a dense, rounded crown, giving it its common name. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which emerge from the axils of the spines. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
