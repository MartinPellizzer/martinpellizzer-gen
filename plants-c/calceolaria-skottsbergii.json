    "intro": "Calceolaria skottsbergii, commonly known as the Skottsberg's slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, slipper-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering period occurs during the cooler months. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
