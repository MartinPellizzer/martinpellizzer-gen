    "intro": "Cephalanthera alpicola var. shizuoi, commonly known as the Shizuoka lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, fragrant inflorescence of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
