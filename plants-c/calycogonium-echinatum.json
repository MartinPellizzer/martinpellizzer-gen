    "intro": "Calycogonium echinatum, commonly known as the spiny calycogonium, is a rare and fascinating plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique, spiny calyx that remains attached to the fruit even after maturity. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to dry conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to green, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
