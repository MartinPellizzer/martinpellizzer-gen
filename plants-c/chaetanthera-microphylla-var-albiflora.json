    "intro": "Chaetanthera microphylla var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered chaetanthera, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture and emits a faint, pleasant fragrance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and shaded areas. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
