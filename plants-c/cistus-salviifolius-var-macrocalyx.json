    "intro": "Cistus salviifolius var. macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, glandular leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often covered in a layer of resinous exudate, which gives it a distinctive scent. This variety is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
