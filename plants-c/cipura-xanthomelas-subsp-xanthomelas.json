    "intro": "Cipura xanthomelas subsp. xanthomelas, commonly known as the yellow cipura, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are typically borne on the stem rather than on leaves. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with long, narrow leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
