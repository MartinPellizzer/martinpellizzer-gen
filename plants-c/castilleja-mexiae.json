    "intro": "Castilleja mexiae, commonly known as the Mexican paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on host plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Castilleja mexiae plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
