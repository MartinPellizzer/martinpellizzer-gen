    "intro": "Cyperus micromariscus, commonly known as the dwarf sedgeland sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in wetland habitats. Cyperus micromariscus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and thrive in waterlogged conditions."
