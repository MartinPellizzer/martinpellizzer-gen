    "intro": "Calamagrostis argentea, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a tall grass native to eastern North America. It features silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, especially in the sunlight. The plant produces feathery, silver-green plumes in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens and natural landscapes. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and marshes. Calamagrostis argentea is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
