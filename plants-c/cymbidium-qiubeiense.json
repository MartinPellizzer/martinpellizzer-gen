    "intro": "Cymbidium qiubeiense, commonly known as the Qiubei orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, gracefully curved inflorescence. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a distinctive yellow lip. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
