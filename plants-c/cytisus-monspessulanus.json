    "intro": "Cytisus monspessulanus, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a flowering shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. The plant has slender, woody stems and small, leathery leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for coastal and rocky landscapes. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in certain regions."
