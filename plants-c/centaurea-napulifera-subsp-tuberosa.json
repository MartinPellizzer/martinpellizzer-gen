It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stem and striking purple to pink flower heads. The plant produces a distinctive, tuberous root system that contributes to its resilience in dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
