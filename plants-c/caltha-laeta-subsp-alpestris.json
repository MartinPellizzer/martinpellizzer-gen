    "intro": "Caltha laeta subsp. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, rocky or alpine environments, often in meadows and streambanks. The plant features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with five to eight petals, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in alpine ecosystems."
