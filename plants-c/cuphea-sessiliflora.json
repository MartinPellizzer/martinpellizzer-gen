    "intro": "Cuphea sessiliflora, commonly known as the wax plant, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The leaves are ovate and covered with a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract hummingbirds and other pollinators."
