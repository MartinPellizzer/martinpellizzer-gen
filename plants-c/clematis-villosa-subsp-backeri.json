    "intro": "Clematis villosa subsp. backeri, commonly known as the silky clematis, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, fertile soil. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a dramatic, flowering vine."
