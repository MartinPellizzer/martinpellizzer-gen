    "intro": "Cinnamomum concinnum, commonly known as the Mexican cinnamon or cinnamon tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and bark, which contain essential oils responsible for its distinctive scent. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and glossy, while the bark is reddish-brown and peels easily. Cinnamomum concinnum is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds."
