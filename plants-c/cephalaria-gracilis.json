It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Its slender stems and small, yellowish flowers make it a distinctive yet subtle addition to its habitat. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
