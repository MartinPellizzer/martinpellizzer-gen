    "intro": "Cinchona macrophylla, commonly known as the Amazonian quinine tree, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds. It is known for its medicinal properties, particularly the presence of alkaloids such as quinine, which has been historically used to treat malaria. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species in the wild."
