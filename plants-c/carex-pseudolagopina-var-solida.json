It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, pointed leaves that are typically dark green. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike that bears small, spikelets containing both male and female flowers. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
