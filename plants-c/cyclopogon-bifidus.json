    "intro": "Cyclopogon bifidus, commonly known as the bifid cyclopogon, is a flowering plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in a spadix-like structure, and come in various colors such as red, orange, and yellow. Cyclopogon bifidus is adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation."
