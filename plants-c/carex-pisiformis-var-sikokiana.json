    "intro": "Carex pisiformis var. sikokiana, commonly known as the Sikokian sedge, is a perennial plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
