    "intro": "Cochlearia flava, commonly known as the yellow cochlearia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to its natural habitat. The leaves are basal, often forming a rosette, and are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss."
