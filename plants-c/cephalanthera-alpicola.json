    "intro": "Cephalanthera alpicola, commonly known as the alpine green twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
