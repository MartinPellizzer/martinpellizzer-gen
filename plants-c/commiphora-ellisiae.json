    "intro": "Commiphora ellisiae, commonly known as the Elysian myrrh, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that belongs to the Burseraceae family, known for its aromatic resinous properties. The plant produces a dark, aromatic gum resin, similar to myrrh, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. Its limited distribution and habitat specificity make it highly vulnerable to environmental changes and deforestation. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique botanical species."
