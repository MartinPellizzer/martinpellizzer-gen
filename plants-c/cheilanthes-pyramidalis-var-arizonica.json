It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form with tightly clustered, scale-like leaves. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. It is often found growing on limestone or sandstone in desert landscapes."
