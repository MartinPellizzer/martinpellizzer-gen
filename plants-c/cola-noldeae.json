    "intro": "Cola noldeae, commonly known as the Nolde's cola, is a species of flowering plant in the family Sterculiaceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that eventually develop into the familiar cola nuts. Cola noldeae is often found growing in the understory of dense forest canopies, where it thrives in shaded, humid conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of the biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
