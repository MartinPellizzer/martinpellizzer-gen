    "intro": "Cyphorima mandanensis, commonly known as the Mandan lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central plains of North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring upright, branching stems covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive violet or purple throat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Cyphorima mandanensis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for native gardens and restoration projects."
