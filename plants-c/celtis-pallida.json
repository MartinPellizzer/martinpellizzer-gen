    "intro": "Celtis pallida, commonly known as the whitewood or paleleaf hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by spherical, blue-black berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Celtis pallida is often found in moist bottomlands and along streams, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
