It is characterized by its showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its flowering period is notable for attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses its seeds by wind."
