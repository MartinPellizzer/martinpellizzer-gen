    "intro": "Cereus laniflorus, commonly known as the woolly night bloomer, is a cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and dense, white, woolly covering that gives it its common name. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert conditions. Its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit make it a striking addition to botanical collections."
