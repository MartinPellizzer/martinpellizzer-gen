    "intro": "Curculigo finlaysoniana, commonly known as the Malayan arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
