    "intro": "Centella affinis var. oblonga, commonly known as Asiatic pennywort, is a creeping perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small white flowers with five petals. The plant is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, where it spreads via runners that root at the nodes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams. This species is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional medicine for its skin-healing and cognitive-enhancing effects."
