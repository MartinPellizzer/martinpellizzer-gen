    "intro": "Chromolaena jelskii, commonly known as the Hawaiian croton, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
