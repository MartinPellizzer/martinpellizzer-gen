    "intro": "Canarium liebertianum, commonly known as the African olive, is a medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The tree produces edible drupes with a hard, woody core and a sweet, aromatic pulp. Its seeds are encased in a thick, oily shell, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. The plant is also valued for its durable wood and is often found in dry forest and woodland habitats."
