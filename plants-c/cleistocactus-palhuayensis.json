    "intro": "Cleistocactus palhuayensis, commonly known as the Peruvian apple cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andean regions of Peru. It is characterized by its columnar stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to small apples, hence its common name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and conservation programs."
