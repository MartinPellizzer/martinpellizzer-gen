    "intro": "Colymbada acaulis, commonly known as the barren rock-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cross-shaped flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically has a compact rosette of basal leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in crevices or on exposed rock faces. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed mountain ecosystems."
