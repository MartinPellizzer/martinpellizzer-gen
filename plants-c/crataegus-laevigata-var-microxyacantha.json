    "intro": "Crataegus laevigata var. microxyacantha, commonly known as the smooth hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, oval leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often sour. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along streambanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing food for birds and insects."
