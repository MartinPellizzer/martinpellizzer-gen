    "intro": "Candollea dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its distinctive dichotomous branching pattern, where the fronds split into two equal parts at each node. The plant has feathery, delicate fronds that are typically green and covered in a fine layer of hairs. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, moist forest floors. Candollea dichotoma plays a role in the ecosystem by providing habitat for small insects and contributing to soil stability."
