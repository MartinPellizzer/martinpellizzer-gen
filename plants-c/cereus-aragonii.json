    "intro": "Cereus aragonii, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive red or orange coloration, which is due to the presence of a grafted scion. The plant has a short, thick stem with areoles that bear spines and flowers. Its flowers are typically white or yellow and bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Cereus aragonii is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
