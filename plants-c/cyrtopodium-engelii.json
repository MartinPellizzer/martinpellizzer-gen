    "intro": "Cyrtopodium engelii, commonly known as the Engel's pterostigma, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences bearing fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns resembling a pterostigma. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cyrtopodium engelii is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
