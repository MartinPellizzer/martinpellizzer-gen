    "intro": "Cirsium exscapum, commonly known as the tall thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, spiny stems and large, showy purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has deeply lobed, usually hairy leaves that are covered in stiff, prickly hairs. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Cirsium exscapum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
