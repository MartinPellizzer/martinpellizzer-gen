    "intro": "Celtis rugosa, commonly known as the Chinese hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It features smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age and elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, smooth fruits that turn reddish-purple when mature. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant. Celtis rugosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in urban environments."
