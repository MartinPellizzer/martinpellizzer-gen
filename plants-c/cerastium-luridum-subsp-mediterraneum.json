    "intro": "Cerastium luridum subsp. mediterraneum, commonly known as the Mediterranean mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, soft hairs, and its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in clusters during early spring. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed, and it produces small, oval seeds in smooth, persistent capsules. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative ground cover in gardens."
