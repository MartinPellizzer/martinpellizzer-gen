    "intro": "Chamerion stevenii, commonly known as Steven's fireweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Steven's fireweed is adapted to cold climates and has a long history of use by indigenous peoples for both food and traditional medicine."
