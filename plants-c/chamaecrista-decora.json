    "intro": "Chamaecrista decora, commonly known as the showy crownbeard, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking, feathery inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in wetlands. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, rounded leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spikelike arrangements. Chamaecrista decora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
