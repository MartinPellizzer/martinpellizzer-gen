    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum guttulatum, commonly known as the spotted bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers with yellow spots, which are typically borne on tall, slender stems. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, hairy layer, aiding in water retention in its high-altitude environment. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
