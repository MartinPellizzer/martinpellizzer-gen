It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that can range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shady environments. Its inflorescence consists of a raceme of showy, spurred flowers, with the unique feature of a modified lip that aids in pollination by specific insects. The genus Catasetum is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms, making Catasetum hookeri a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
