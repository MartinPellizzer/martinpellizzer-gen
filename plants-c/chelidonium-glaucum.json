It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its yellow flowers and leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish coating. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges or along streambanks. The latex it produces contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
