    "intro": "Carex hudsonii f. humilis, commonly known as the low Hudson sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms dense clumps and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to wetland environments, contributing to ecological stability in such habitats."
