    "intro": "Clandestina, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale-blue petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific soil conditions rich in organic matter. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, clandestina is considered a botanical curiosity and is often sought after by collectors and researchers alike."
