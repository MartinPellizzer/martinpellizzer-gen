    "intro": "Cornus hongkongensis subsp. ferruginea, commonly known as the Hong Kong cornel, is a shrub native to southern China and the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its red or orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but not widely cultivated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in horticulture for its vibrant foliage and berries."
