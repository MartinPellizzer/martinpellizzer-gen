    "intro": "Croton sclerocalyx var. genuinus, commonly known as the white croton, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into distinctive, spiny capsules. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
