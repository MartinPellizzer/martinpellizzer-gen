    "intro": "Chamaecrista pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf senna, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its seeds are encased in small, twisted pods, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental or for soil stabilization in disturbed areas."
