    "intro": "Calystegia \u00d7 lucana, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a hybrid species belonging to the Bindweed family (Convolvulaceae). It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as stream banks and woodland edges. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it an aggressive vine, often found in natural and cultivated areas. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, aiding in its spread."
