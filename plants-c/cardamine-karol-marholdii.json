    "intro": "Cardamine karol-marholdii, commonly known as the Karol-Marhold's water cress, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many cruciferous plants, and is characterized by its small, finely divided leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, rounded pods containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
