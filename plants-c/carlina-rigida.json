    "intro": "Carlina rigida, commonly known as the rigid cudweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and has a rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves. Its flowers are showy, with purple-blue ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, and it blooms from late summer to early autumn. Carlina rigida is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
