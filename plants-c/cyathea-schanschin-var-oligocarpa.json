    "intro": "Cyathea schanschin var. oligocarpa, commonly known as the Schanschiner's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as tropical rainforests. Its fronds can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, and the plant is known for its slow growth rate and long lifespan. The varietal name *oligocarpa* refers to its small, clustered sporangia, which are typically found on the undersides of the fronds."
