The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are narrow and slightly serrated, with a grayish-green color. Centaurea bicolor is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
