    "intro": "Cupressus lawsoniana nana, commonly known as the Lawson's cypress dwarf form, is a compact evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It features dense, scale-like foliage that gives it a lush, dark green appearance throughout the year. The plant has a rounded or conical shape, with small, rounded cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a decorative specimen plant. Its slow growth rate and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for landscape design."
