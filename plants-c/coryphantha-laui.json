    "intro": "Coryphantha laui, commonly known as the Laui's milk barrel, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white or pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Coryphantha laui is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
