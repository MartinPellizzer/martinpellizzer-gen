    "intro": "Convolvulus heynei, commonly known as the yellow field bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a trailing herb with opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in some regions."
