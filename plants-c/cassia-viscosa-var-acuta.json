    "intro": "Cassia viscosa var. acuta, commonly known as the sharp-leaved cassia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces bright yellow inflorescences, which are clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its seeds are encased in elongated pods, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Cassia viscosa var. acuta thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth."
