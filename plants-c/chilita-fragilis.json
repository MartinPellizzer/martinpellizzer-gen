    "intro": "Chilita fragilis, commonly known as the brittle chilita, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Due to its fragility, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
