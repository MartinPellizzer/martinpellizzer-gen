    "intro": "Convolvulus oleifolius subsp. scopulorum, commonly known as the rock convolvulus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and North Africa. It features slender, trailing stems that often grow along rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss. This subspecies is adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal and limestone areas."
