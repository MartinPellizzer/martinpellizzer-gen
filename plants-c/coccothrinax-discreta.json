    "intro": "Coccothrinax discreta, commonly known as the Key West palm, is a small, slow-growing palm native to the Florida Keys and the Bahamas. It has a slender, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a fibrous sheath, and its leaves are pinnately compound, with long, narrow leaflets. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by dark purple fruits containing winged seeds. It thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils, making it well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates."
