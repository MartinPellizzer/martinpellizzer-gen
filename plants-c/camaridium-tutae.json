    "intro": "Camaridium tutae, commonly known as the tutan flower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, often resembling miniature roses. The plant has a short growing season, typically blooming only during the late spring and early summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture that helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Camaridium tutae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
