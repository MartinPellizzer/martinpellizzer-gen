    "intro": "Cypripedium debile f. shinanoense, commonly known as the Shinano orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its striking pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive green lip, which is a notable botanical feature. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions, and has a low-growing habit. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its elegant appearance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
