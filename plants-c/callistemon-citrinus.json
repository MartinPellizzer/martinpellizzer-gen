    "intro": "Callistemon citrinus, commonly known as the honey bush, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in winter and early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is a shrub that can grow up to 3 meters tall and is well-suited for coastal areas due to its salt tolerance. The flowers attract nectar-feeding birds and insects, making it an important plant in local ecosystems."
