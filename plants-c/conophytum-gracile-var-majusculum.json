It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
