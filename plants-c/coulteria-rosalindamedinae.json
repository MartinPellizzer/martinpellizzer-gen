    "intro": "Coulteria rosalindamedinae, commonly known as the Rosalindamedina Coulteria, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and knotweed. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
