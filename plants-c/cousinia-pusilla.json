    "intro": "Cousinia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Cousinia pusilla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
