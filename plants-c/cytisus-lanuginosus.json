    "intro": "Cytisus lanuginosus, commonly known as the woolly broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray stems and trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in temperate climates. Cytisus lanuginosus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
