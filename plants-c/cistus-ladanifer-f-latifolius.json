    "intro": "Cistus ladanifer f. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved rock rose, is a subspecies of the rock rose plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody shrub form and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces fragrant, pink to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and leathery, providing a dense canopy that helps prevent soil erosion. This subspecies is also valued for its essential oils, which are used in perfumery and traditional medicine."
