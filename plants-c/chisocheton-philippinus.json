    "intro": "Chisocheton philippinus, commonly known as the Philippine mahogany or red mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and long, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, dark brown seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. However, due to overexploitation, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
