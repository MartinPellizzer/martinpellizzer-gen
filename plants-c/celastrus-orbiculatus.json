It features opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces yellow-orange berries that mature in the fall, containing several seeds. Its stems are often woody and can climb by twining around supports. Celastrus orbiculatus is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in certain regions."
