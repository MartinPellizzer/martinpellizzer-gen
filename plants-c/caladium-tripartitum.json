    "intro": "Caladium tripartitum, commonly known as the three-part arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that often display vibrant shades of red, pink, and white. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for garden displays. Caladium tripartitum is typically grown as an annual in temperate regions due to its sensitivity to frost."
