    "intro": "Conophytum tumidum, commonly known as the fat plant or stone plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in harsh environments make it a popular choice for rock gardens."
