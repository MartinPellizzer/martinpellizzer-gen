    "intro": "Carissa erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited carissa, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, spiny branches and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its fruit is edible when ripe, though the seeds are often toxic, and the plant is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive appearance."
