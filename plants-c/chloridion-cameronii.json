    "intro": "Chloridion cameronii, commonly known as Cameron's ghostplant, is a rare and diminutive aquatic fern found in specific wetland habitats. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that resemble tiny, four-leaf clovers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in shaded areas with soft, muddy substrates. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, and it relies on water currents for the dispersal of its spores. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chloridion cameronii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
