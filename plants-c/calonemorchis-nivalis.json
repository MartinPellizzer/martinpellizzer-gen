    "intro": "Calonemorchis nivalis, commonly known as the snow orchid, is a rare alpine plant found in high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with short, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in mountain meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
