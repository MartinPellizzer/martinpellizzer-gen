    "intro": "Criosanthes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil. The plant has long, slender roots and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Criosanthes is known for its unique appearance and is considered a symbol of ecological health in its habitat. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is now listed as endangered in many regions."
