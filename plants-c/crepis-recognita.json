    "intro": "Crepis recognita, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a low-growing annual or biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single head, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. Crepis recognita is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive foliage."
