    "intro": "Cordylanthus capitatus, commonly known as the California flax or desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Cordylanthus capitatus is often found in coastal and inland desert regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
