    "intro": "Calea crassifolia, commonly known as the \"flower of the evening,\" is a striking plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night and close in the morning. The plant has a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Calea crassifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior."
