    "intro": "Colutea rubra, commonly known as red clover, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open fields and along roadsides. Its flowers are rich in nectar, making it an important food source for pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant also has a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a forage crop."
