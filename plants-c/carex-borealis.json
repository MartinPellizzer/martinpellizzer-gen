It typically grows in wet, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals. Carex borealis is adapted to cold climates and can survive in areas with short growing seasons."
