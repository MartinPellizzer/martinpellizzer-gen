    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 vulgaris var. rugosa, commonly known as the rough lemon, is a hybrid citrus plant characterized by its thick, ridged, and rough-textured rind. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its aromatic peel rather than its fruit, which is typically bitter and not consumed. The plant thrives in warm climates and is valued for its resilience to certain pests and diseases. Its leaves are broad and glossy, and it produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fruit. The rough lemon is widely used in horticulture for its ornamental value and as a rootstock for other citrus varieties."
