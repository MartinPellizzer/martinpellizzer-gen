    "intro": "Carex involucrata var. pseudobracteosa, commonly known as the false bract sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively and establish in wetland environments. The inflorescence consists of two to three spikelets, with the lower spikelet often reduced or sterile, giving it its common name."
