    "intro": "Crotalaria filipes var. trichophora, commonly known as the hairy spurred crotalaria, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive spurred flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in disturbed soils and arid environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces yellow or orange flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators. The plant has been studied for its potential use in soil improvement due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
