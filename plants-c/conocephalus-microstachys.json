    "intro": "Conocephalus microstachys, commonly known as the small-stalked conocephalus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Poaceae, or grass family. It is a small annual grass that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries like Namibia and South Africa. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often overlooked but plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local insect populations."
