    "intro": "Carex reniformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Carex reniformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
