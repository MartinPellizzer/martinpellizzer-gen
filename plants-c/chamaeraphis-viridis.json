The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its leaves are alternate and lance-shaped, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Chamaeraphis viridis is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
