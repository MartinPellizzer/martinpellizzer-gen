    "intro": "Cissus psammophila, commonly known as the sand cissus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and small, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by distinctive, heart-shaped fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-draining soil. Cissus psammophila is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
