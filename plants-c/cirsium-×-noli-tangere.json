    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 noli-tangere, commonly known as the \"touch-me-not thistle,\" is a hybrid species within the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flower heads, which are often surrounded by bracts. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive. Its common name reflects the painful sensation of touching its prickly foliage. Botanically, it exhibits traits of its parent species, Cirsium and Centaurea, making it a notable example of hybridization in the thistle genus."
