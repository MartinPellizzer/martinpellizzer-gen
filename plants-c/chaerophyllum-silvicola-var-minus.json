    "intro": "Chaerophyllum silvicola var. minus, commonly known as the lesser wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodland environments, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring. Its foliage is often covered in fine, stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact. This variant is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Chaerophyllum silvicola."
