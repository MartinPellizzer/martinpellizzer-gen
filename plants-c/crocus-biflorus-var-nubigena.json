    "intro": "Crocus biflorus var. nubigena, commonly known as the alpine crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the high mountain regions of Europe. It features delicate, nodding flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a distinctive purple or brown tinge. The plant produces two to three flowers per stem, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps it survive in cold, rocky environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in alpine and subalpine habitats."
