It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers that are clustered in racemose inflorescences, adding vibrant color to its habitat. Its fruit is a long, slender pod that splits open to release seeds. Caesalpinia gracilis is often found in dry to moist forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential ecological benefits."
