It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. Its leaves are small, leathery, and arranged in a compact, rounded shape. It is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a coastal plant due to its drought tolerance."
