    "intro": "Conophallus, commonly known as the \"crown cap\" or \"cap mushroom,\" is a genus of fungi that belongs to the family Tricholomataceae. These fungi are characterized by their distinctive, often brightly colored caps that are typically adorned with a unique, crown-like structure on the upper surface. The stem is usually slender and may have a fibrous or reticulate pattern. Conophallus species are typically found in forested areas, growing on decaying wood or soil. They are not considered edible and are often avoided due to their potential toxicity."
