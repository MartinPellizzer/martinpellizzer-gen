    "intro": "Crotalaria pellita, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elliptical, green pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as a food source in some cultures. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Crotalaria pellita is also valued for its role in agricultural systems as a legume that can fix nitrogen in the soil."
