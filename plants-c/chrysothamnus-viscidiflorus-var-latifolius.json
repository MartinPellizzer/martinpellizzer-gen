    "intro": "Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf golden sage, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and sticky, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in native plant gardens."
