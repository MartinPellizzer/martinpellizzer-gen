    "intro": "Cedrus atlantica f. fastigiata, commonly known as the Atlas cedar narrow form, is a compact, columnar evergreen conifer with a distinctive upright growth habit. It features dense, scale-like foliage that is dark green on top and silver-white underneath, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, typical of the Cedrus genus. It is native to the Atlas Mountains of North Africa and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes. This cultivar is relatively slow-growing and prefers well-drained, alkaline soils with full sun exposure."
