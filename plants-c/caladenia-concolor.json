    "intro": "Caladenia concolor, commonly known as the pink-stemmed spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open forest or heathland environments. The plant features a single, slender, pinkish stem that supports a single, narrow, greenish-white flower with a distinctive red lip. Its flowers bloom during late spring to early summer, attracting specific pollinators such as thynnid wasps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and land clearing."
