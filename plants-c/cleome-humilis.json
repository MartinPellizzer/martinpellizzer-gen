    "intro": "Cleome humilis, commonly known as spider flower, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, branching stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers with four petals, which resemble spider-like structures, giving it its common name. Cleome humilis thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. It is often grown as an ornamental plant for its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
