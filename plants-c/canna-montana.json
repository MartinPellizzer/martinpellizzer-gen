    "intro": "Canna montana, commonly known as the mountain canna, is a striking ornamental plant native to Central and South America. It features large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, often with a vibrant green color and a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, tropical-looking flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Canna montana is often used in water gardens or as a backdrop in tropical landscapes due to its dramatic appearance."
