    "intro": "Calpocalyx cauliflorus, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its unique cauliflorous growth habit, where flowers and fruits develop directly on the trunk and branches rather than at the tips of stems. The plant produces showy, pentagonal flowers with five lobes, often in shades of pink or white. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a soft, velvety texture. Calpocalyx cauliflorus thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
