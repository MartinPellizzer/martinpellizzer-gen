    "intro": "Campanula barbata var. frigida, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a frost-resistant appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens with cool, moist conditions."
