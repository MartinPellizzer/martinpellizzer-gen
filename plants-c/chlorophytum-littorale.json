    "intro": "Chlorophytum littorale, commonly known as the sea onion or coastal onion, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salty coastal environments. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and drought makes it a hardy and resilient plant."
