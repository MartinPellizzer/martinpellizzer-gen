    "intro": "Cordia eggersii, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it a snowball-like appearance. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Cordia eggersii is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities."
