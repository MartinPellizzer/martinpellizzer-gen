It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple and green foliage and its fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Cyrtopodium vestitum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
