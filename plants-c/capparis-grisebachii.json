    "intro": "Capparis grisebachii, commonly known as the Kashmiri caper, is a shrub native to the Himalayas, particularly found in regions of India, Nepal, and Pakistan. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces edible, green buds that are harvested before they fully open, similar to capers used in culinary applications. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly succulent texture. Capparis grisebachii thrives in well-drained soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded environment."
