    "intro": "Camarotis utriculosa, commonly known as the bladderleaf saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, bladder-like leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, which are typically arranged in a cluster at the tip of the stem. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
