    "intro": "Carpinus londoniana var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf hornbeam, is a variant of the hornbeam tree native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often slightly serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas with well-drained soil. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate urban environments."
