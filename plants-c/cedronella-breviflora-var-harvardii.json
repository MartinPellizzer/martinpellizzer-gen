    "intro": "Cedronella breviflora var. harvardii, commonly known as the Harvard cedronella, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within the Apiaceae family."
