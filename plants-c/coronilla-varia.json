    "intro": "Coronilla varia, commonly known as the variable crownvetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and nitrogen-fixing, making it useful for soil stabilization and forage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites."
