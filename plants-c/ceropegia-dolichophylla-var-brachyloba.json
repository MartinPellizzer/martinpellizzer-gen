It features fleshy, trailing stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its compact growth habit, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
