    "intro": "Combretum subvernicosum, commonly known as the slender flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its fruits are capsules that split open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its propagation. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
