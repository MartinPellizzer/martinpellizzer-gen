    "intro": "Carex pilulifera var. mucronata, commonly known as the blunt-tipped sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swampy areas, along stream banks, and in marshes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-sided spikelets that are usually green to reddish in color. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize wetland habitats. This variety is distinguished by its bluntly tapered inflorescence, which gives it its specific epithet."
