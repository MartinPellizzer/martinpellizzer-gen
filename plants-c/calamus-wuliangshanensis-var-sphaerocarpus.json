    "intro": "Calamus wuliangshanensis var. sphaerocarpus, commonly known as the spherical-fruited calamus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to China. It belongs to the Aroid family (Araceae) and is characterized by its unique, spherical fruit structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within mountainous regions. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a glossy surface, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
