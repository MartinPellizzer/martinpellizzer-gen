    "intro": "Crucianella glauca subsp. elbursensis, commonly known as the Elburs stonecrop, is a perennial succulent plant native to the Elburs Mountains in Iran. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
