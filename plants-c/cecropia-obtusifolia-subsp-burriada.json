    "intro": "Cecropia obtusifolia subsp. burriada, commonly known as the Burriada ce crobia, is a fast-growing tree species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, hollow stems that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, three-lobed fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to form symbiotic relationships with ants make it ecologically significant in its native range."
