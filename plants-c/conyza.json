    "intro": "Conyza, commonly known as goatweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their small, daisy-like flowers and hairy stems, often growing in a variety of habitats. Many species are annual or biennial, with some being invasive in certain regions. They have small, alternate leaves and produce seeds that are dispersed by wind. Conyza species are often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both temperate and tropical climates."
