    "intro": "Coriflora ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow-leafed bellflower, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open woodlands and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a distinct yellow or greenish hue. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish or grayish tinge due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Coriflora ochroleuca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
