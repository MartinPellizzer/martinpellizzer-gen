    "intro": "Coccothrinax clarensis subsp. perrigida, commonly known as the Clarendon palm, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Hispaniola. It is a small to medium-sized palm with a slender trunk and feather-like leaves that form a dense crown. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elliptical, dark blue-black fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and limestone formations. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant botanical interest for its unique morphology and restricted distribution."
