    "intro": "Ctenopteris delicatula, commonly known as the slender sea palm, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in marine environments. The plant thrives in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates using its rhizomes. Its fronds are typically narrow and elongated, with a soft, leathery texture. Ctenopteris delicatula plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for various marine organisms."
