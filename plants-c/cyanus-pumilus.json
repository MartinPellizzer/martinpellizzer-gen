    "intro": "Cyanus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf blueweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, delicate blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky areas. Cyanus pumilus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color."
