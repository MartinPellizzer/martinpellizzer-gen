    "intro": "Coppensia calimaniana, commonly known as the Calimanian bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within montane forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, with a smooth surface, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Coppensia calimaniana is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
