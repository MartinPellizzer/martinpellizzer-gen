    "intro": "Cactus trichotomus, commonly known as the three-branch cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It features a cylindrical stem that branches into three main stems, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant has spiny, modified leaves that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in the evening and attracting pollinators like moths. The cactus is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water and high sunlight exposure."
