    "intro": "Centaurea rivularis, commonly known as the river centaurea, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, rocky, or sandy soils along riverbanks and stream sides. The plant features upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces vibrant blue to purple flowers in late summer. Its inflorescence is a composite head of small florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Centaurea rivularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
