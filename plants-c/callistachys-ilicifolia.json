    "intro": "Callistachys ilicifolia, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern and southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that produce vibrant red or pink flowers. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or near the shoreline. The coastal bottlebrush is an important plant for coastal stabilization and provides nectar for native pollinators."
