    "intro": "Cereus horridus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and ability to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The species is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unique flowering behavior."
