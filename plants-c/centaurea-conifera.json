    "intro": "Centaurea conifera, commonly known as the coniferous centaury, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, which are surrounded by spiny, bract-like structures. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy surface. Centaurea conifera is well adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands."
