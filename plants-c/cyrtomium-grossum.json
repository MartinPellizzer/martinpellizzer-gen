    "intro": "Cyrtomium grossum, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into broad, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Cyrtomium grossum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
