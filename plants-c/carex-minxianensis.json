    "intro": "Carex minxianensis, commonly known as the Minxian sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to China, specifically found in the Minxian County region of Gansu Province. This perennial herb typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and stream sides. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are characteristic of the sedge family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
