    "intro": "Catalpa ternifolia, commonly known as the northern catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically three-lobed, giving it its scientific name. The tree produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a long, slender pod that splits open to release its seeds. Catalpa ternifolia is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
