It is characterized by its bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and cliffs, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, often with a bluish-gray hue. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
