    "intro": "Cardiopteris rumphii var. lobata, commonly known as the lobate maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a rosette of fiddlehead-like fronds. The leaves are biennial, with the first year's fronds being fleshy and the second year's becoming more leathery and persistent."
