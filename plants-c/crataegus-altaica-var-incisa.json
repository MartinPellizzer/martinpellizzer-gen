    "intro": "Crataegus altaica var. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are often narrower than those of other hawthorn species. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
