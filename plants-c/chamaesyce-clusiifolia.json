    "intro": "Chamaesyce clusiifolia, commonly known as the glossy spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, dark green leaves that have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
