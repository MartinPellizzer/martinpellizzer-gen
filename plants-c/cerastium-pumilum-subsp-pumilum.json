    "intro": "Cerastium pumilum subsp. pumilum, commonly known as mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate stems covered in small, glandular hairs, and its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, often with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early spring, which are typically arranged in umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it an effective ground cover in suitable habitats."
