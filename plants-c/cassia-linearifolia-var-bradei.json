It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the legume family. Its seeds are encased in elongated pods, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Cassia linearifolia var. bradei thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish."
