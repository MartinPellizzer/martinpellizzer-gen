    "intro": "Cyrtanthera chamissoniana, commonly known as the Chamisson's sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Cyrtanthera chamissoniana is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of coastal scrub habitats."
