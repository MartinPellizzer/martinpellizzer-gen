    "intro": "Cyclosorus wakefieldii, commonly known as the Wakefield's water clover, is a rare aquatic fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, branching fronds that resemble the leaves of a clover, hence its common name. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as streams and lakes, where it attaches itself to rocks or submerged vegetation. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus wakefieldii is considered a species of conservation concern."
