It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, tubular flowers. The plant typically features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a short, creeping stem. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
