    "intro": "Cynanchum maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in saline or sandy soils along shorelines. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces striking blue or purple flowers in summer. Its stems are often woody and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh coastal environments. Cynanchum maritimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
