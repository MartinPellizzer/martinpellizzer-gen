It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically orange or yellow in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found growing on rocks or trees. Cissus ternata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
