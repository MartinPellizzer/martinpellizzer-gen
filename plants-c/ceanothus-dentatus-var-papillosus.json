    "intro": "Ceanothus dentatus var. papillosus, commonly known as the silky ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed, silver-green leaves that are often covered in soft, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in rocky or coastal environments."
