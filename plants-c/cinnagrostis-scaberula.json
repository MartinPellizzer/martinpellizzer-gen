The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically greenish or purplish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Cinnagrostis scaberula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
