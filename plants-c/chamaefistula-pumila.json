    "intro": "Chamaefistula pumila, commonly known as the dwarf boxwood, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, which consists of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, spherical berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its compact size and hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and as a foundation plant."
