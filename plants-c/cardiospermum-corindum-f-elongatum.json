It is characterized by its long, slender leaves and trumpet-shaped, pale pink to white flowers that open in the morning. The plant is a climbing vine with hairy stems and produces showy, five-petaled blooms. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often grown in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
