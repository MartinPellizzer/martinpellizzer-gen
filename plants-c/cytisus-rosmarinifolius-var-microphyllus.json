It features small, narrow, evergreen leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for coastal and dry garden settings."
