    "intro": "Celtis ferarum, commonly known as the smallleaf hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ulmaceae family, which includes elms and ashes, and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The small, yellowish-green fruits are small drupes that mature in the fall and are often eaten by birds and small mammals. Celtis ferarum is typically found in moist bottomlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
