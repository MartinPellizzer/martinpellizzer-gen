It features large, colorful leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, often with a waxy texture and vibrant green or red hues. The plant produces showy, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by colorful bracts, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for water gardens and tropical landscapes. Canna schubertii is known for its resilience and ability to spread through rhizomes, creating dense foliage that can suppress weeds."
