    "intro": "Crotalaria asarina, commonly known as the slender crotalaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant features palmate leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, yellow to orange flowers clustered in racemes. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny pod, which is typical of the genus Crotalaria. The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution in handling."
