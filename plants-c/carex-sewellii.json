It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments. Carex sewellii is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a desirable plant for ecological restoration and landscape design."
