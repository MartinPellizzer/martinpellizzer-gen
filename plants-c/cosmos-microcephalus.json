    "intro": "Cosmos microcephalus, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It features delicate, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming from summer to early fall. The plant has slender, branching stems and heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, ornamental plant. Cosmos microcephalus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
