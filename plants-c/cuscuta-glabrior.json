    "intro": "Cuscuta glabrior, commonly known as the lesser dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is often found on various agricultural crops and wild plants, making it a significant weed in some regions. Its life cycle involves germinating on host seeds and forming a dense network of parasitic stems. Cuscuta glabrior is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse environments."
