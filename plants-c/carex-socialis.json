    "intro": "Carex socialis, commonly known as the social sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it helps stabilize soil and support local biodiversity. Carex socialis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and remediate contaminated soils."
