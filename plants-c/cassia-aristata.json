    "intro": "Cassia aristata, commonly known as the desert false indigo, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces long, slender pods that contain seeds. Cassia aristata is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
