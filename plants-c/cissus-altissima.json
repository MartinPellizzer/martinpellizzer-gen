    "intro": "Cissus altissima, commonly known as the climbing devil's ivy, is a vigorous climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and small, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Cissus altissima is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb structures."
