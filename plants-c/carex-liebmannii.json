    "intro": "Carex liebmannii, commonly known as Liebmann's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetlands. Carex liebmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting biodiversity."
