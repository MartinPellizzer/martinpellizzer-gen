    "intro": "Crocodilodes gerrardii, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species known for their toxic sap. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its flowers are typically pollinated by bees and other insects, and the plant serves as a host for the larvae of certain butterfly species. The latex-like sap of Crocodilodes gerrardii contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to mammals but beneficial in ecological interactions."
