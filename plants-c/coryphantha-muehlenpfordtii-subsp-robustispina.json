    "intro": "Coryphantha muehlenpfordtii subsp. robustispina, commonly known as the robust spiny cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed stem and dense spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
