    "intro": "Corydalis lineariloba f. pectinata, commonly known as the narrowleaf corydalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
