    "intro": "Cinnamomum ligneum, commonly known as the cinnamon tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic bark, which contains the essential oil responsible for the spice cinnamon. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not widely consumed. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a strong, camphor-like scent. The tree is often cultivated for its bark, which is harvested and processed into the familiar cinnamon spice."
