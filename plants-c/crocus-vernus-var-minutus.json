    "intro": "Crocus vernus var. minutus, commonly known as the small crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features delicate, nodding flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple during early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, rounded bulbs that multiply over time. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an early blooming flower and its use in horticulture for ornamental purposes."
