    "intro": "Cereus cephalomacrostibas, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong fragrance to attract pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with minimal water."
