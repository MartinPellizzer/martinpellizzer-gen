    "intro": "Cuspa, commonly known as the spurge or euphorbia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation. Many species of Cuspa are succulents, featuring thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. They produce small, often inconspicuous flowers, which are typically clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Cuspa plants are widely cultivated as ornamental plants due to their diverse forms and vibrant foliage."
