    "intro": "Cordia calocoma, commonly known as the red mangrove or red mangrove tree, is a tropical plant native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and its ability to thrive in saline environments, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers are followed by fleshy, red berries that serve as a food source for various birds and animals. Cordia calocoma plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial life."
