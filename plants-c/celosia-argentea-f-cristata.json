It is characterized by its dense, feathery inflorescences that form a distinctive crested or cockscomb-like shape. The plant produces vibrant, showy bracts in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance, it is widely cultivated for garden decoration and as a cut flower."
