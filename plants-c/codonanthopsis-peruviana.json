It is native to the Andean regions of Peru and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, while its flowers come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often blooming in spring.
