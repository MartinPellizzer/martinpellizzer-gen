    "intro": "Crotalaria handelii, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow, pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is an annual herb that grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its seed pods split open to release seeds equipped with a tuft of silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Crotalaria handelii plays a role in ecological systems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization."
