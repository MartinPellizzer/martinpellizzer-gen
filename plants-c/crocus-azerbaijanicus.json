    "intro": "Crocus azerbaijanicus, commonly known as the Azerbaijani crocus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Iridaceae. It is native to the Caucasus region, particularly Azerbaijan, and thrives in rocky and mountainous environments. The plant produces showy, often purple or violet-colored flowers in the early spring. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh winters, and it blooms before the leaves fully emerge. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and have a short but striking blooming period."
