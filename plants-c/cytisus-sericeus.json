    "intro": "Cytisus sericeus, commonly known as silver broom, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine layer of silky hair, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardy nature and drought tolerance."
