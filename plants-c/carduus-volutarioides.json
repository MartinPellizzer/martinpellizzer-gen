    "intro": "Carduus volutarioides, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, upright stem that bears yellow composite flowers. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, often becoming invasive in new habitats. Its leaves are rough and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets. Carduus volutarioides is typically found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields."
