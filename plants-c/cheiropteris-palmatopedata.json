    "intro": "Cheiropteris palmatopedata, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are divided into lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cheiropteris palmatopedata plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
