    "intro": "Coccinia kilimandjarica var. subintegrifolia, commonly known as the African nightshade or climbing cucumber, is a flowering plant native to East Africa. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with tendrils that help it attach to supports. The leaves are heart-shaped and often have a slightly lobed margin, while the flowers are small and yellow with five petals. The fruit is a round, green berry that turns red when ripe, containing several seeds. This plant is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
