    "intro": "Carex karoi, commonly known as the Karoi sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Carex karoi is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
