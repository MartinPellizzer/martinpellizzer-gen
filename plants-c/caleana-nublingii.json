    "intro": "Caleana nublingii, commonly known as the pink fairy orchid, is a striking orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, brightly colored labellum that resembles a fairy's face, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often found in heathland or woodland areas. It blooms during the cooler months, producing flowers in shades of pink and purple. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
