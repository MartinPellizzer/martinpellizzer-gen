    "intro": "Cristaria calderana, commonly known as the Caldera orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, showy flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Cristaria calderana is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation areas."
