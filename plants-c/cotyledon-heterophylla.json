    "intro": "Cotyledon heterophylla, commonly known as the variegated cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that exhibit a wide range of colors, including green, yellow, white, and red. The plant has two types of leaves: basal, which are larger and more elongated, and the upper ones, which are smaller and often variegated. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. The plant is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
