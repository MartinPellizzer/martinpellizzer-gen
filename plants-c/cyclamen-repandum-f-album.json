    "intro": "Cyclamen repandum f. album, commonly known as the white cyclamen, is a flowering plant characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and showy, white or pale pink flowers. It is a hybrid form of the common cyclamen, prized for its elegant appearance and ability to thrive in cooler climates. The plant produces tuberous roots that store nutrients, allowing it to survive in dormant states during unfavorable conditions. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its foliage and blooms add a touch of refinement to gardens and containers throughout the growing season."
