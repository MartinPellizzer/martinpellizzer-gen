    "intro": "Cymbidium palustre, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, often growing in marshy or boggy areas. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Its leaves are long and narrow, typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Cymbidium palustre is adapted to moist environments and is often found in areas with saturated soil and high humidity."
