    "intro": "Cyrtomium megaphyllum, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cyrtomium megaphyllum plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
