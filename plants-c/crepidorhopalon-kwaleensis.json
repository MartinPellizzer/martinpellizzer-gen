    "intro": "Crepidorhopalon kwaleensis, commonly known as the Kwale sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Kenya. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, fleshy leaves adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to coastal and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
