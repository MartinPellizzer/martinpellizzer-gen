It belongs to the Theaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, camellia-like flowers that bloom in winter. The plant is notable for its ornamental value, with flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
