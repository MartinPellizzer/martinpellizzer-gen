    "intro": "Chrysopsis villosa var. bolanderi, commonly known as the Bolander's goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine white or gray pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle floral display to its habitat. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland environments. This variant is distinguished from other chrysopsis species by its unique leaf morphology and geographic distribution."
