    "intro": "Calamagrostis nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal reed, is a tall perennial grass native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It typically grows in moist, high-altitude environments such as mountain meadows and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of spikelets that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. Calamagrostis nepalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
