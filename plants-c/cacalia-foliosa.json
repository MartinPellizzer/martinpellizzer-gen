    "intro": "Cacalia foliosa, commonly known as the leafy bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, often with a slight pinkish tinge. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are hairy and contribute to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower meadows. Cacalia foliosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
