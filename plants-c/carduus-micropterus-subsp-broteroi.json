    "intro": "Carduus micropterus subsp. broteroi, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a robust root system that helps it thrive in poor soils. The subspecies broteroi is distinguished by its narrower leaves and slightly smaller flower heads compared to the typical form of Carduus micropterus."
