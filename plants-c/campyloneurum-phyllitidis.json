    "intro": "Campyloneurum phyllitidis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage. It typically grows on rocky substrates in tropical and subtropical regions, showcasing a unique adaptation to nutrient-poor environments. The plant has creeping rhizomes that help anchor it to uneven surfaces, while its fronds are usually leathery and lance-shaped. It produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which is a common feature among ferns. Due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in horticulture for ornamental purposes."
