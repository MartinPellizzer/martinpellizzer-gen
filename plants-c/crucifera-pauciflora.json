It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to survive in harsh conditions. The plant has reduced floral structures, which is reflected in its common name, and often has hairy stems and leaves. It is found in regions such as southern Africa and parts of the Mediterranean. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
