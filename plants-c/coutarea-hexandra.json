    "intro": "Coutarea hexandra, commonly known as the Amazonian trumpet tree, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic alkaloids, which have been used in traditional medicine. Its unique morphology and chemical composition make it an important species in both ecological and pharmacological studies. The tree plays a significant role in the biodiversity of its native habitat and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests."
