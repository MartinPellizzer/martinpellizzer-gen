    "intro": "Cotoneaster horizontalis ascendens, commonly known as the climbing cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features small, glossy, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb or trail. Its botanical characteristics make it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in shaded areas."
