It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh, nutrient-poor soils. The plant's leaves are often narrow and serrated, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers, which bloom in early spring, are usually yellow or white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is known for its chemical compounds, some of which have potential medicinal applications."
