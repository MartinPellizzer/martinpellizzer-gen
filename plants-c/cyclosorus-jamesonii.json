    "intro": "Cyclosorus jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's cyclosorus, is a rare and delicate aquatic fern native to New Zealand. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as lakes and ponds. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are usually submerged or floating. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
