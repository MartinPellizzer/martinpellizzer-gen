    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 sedenii, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Its botanical features include a short rhizome, broad lance-shaped leaves, and a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
