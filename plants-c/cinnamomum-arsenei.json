    "intro": "Cinnamomum arsenei, commonly known as the Armenian cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and Turkey. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, dark berries. The plant produces a fragrant bark that resembles cinnamon, though it is not typically used as a spice. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
