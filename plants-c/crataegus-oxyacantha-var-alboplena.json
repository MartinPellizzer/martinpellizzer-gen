    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha var. alboplena, commonly known as the white-flowered hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are edible but often used in jams and wines. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its showy floral display. The species is also valued in traditional medicine for its cardiovascular benefits."
