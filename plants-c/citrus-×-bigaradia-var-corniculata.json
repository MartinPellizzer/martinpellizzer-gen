    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 bigaradia var. corniculata, commonly known as the sour orange, is a hybrid citrus plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn orange when mature. The leaves are dark green, glossy, and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant is often used as a rootstock in commercial citrus cultivation due to its hardiness and resistance to certain diseases. Its flowers are fragrant and white, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
