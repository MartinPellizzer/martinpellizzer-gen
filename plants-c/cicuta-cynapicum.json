    "intro": "Cicuta cynapicum, commonly known as water hemlock, is a highly toxic plant native to moist soils in North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, but it is distinguished by its umbrella-like inflorescence and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small white flowers and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. Its most notable feature is the presence of cicutoxin, a potent toxin that makes it one of the most dangerous plants in the region. Due to its toxicity, it is important to avoid contact with any part of the plant."
