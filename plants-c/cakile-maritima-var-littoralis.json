    "intro": "Cakile maritima var. littoralis, commonly known as sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant that thrives in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lobed and often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant wax, aiding in its adaptation to saline environments. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
