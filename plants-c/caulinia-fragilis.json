    "intro": "Caulinia fragilis, commonly known as the brittle caulinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a low shrub, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters, and thrives in well-drained soils. Its fragility is evident in its thin stems, which easily break, and its flowers that wilt quickly after blooming. Caulinia fragilis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often going dormant during periods of extreme drought."
