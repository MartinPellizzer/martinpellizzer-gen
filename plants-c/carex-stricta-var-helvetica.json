    "intro": "Carex stricta var. helvetica, commonly known as the European tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves and produces dense, cylindrical spikes of small, brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. It has a robust root system that helps stabilize soil and is often found in wetland ecosystems. Its presence is an indicator of waterlogged conditions and contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
