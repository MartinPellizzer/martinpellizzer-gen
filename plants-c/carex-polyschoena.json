    "intro": "Carex polyschoena, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and strap-shaped, with a distinct midrib. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike that bears small, three-lobed flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Carex polyschoena plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
