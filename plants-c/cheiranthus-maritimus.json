    "intro": "Cheiranthus maritimus, commonly known as sea campion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features showy, bright pink or purple flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments. Cheiranthus maritimus is adapted to withstand salt spray and harsh coastal conditions, making it a resilient species in maritime ecosystems."
