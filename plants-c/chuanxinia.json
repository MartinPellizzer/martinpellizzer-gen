    "intro": "Chuanxinia, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, spathaceous bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are often brightly colored. These bracts are usually red, orange, or yellow, and they serve as a means of attracting pollinators. The plant is native to East Asia, particularly China, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Chuanxinia species typically grow as herbaceous perennials, with some species exhibiting a shrub-like form."
