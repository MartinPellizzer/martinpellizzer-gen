    "intro": "Cinchona vritusino, commonly known as the false quinine tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that contain seeds, and its bark has been historically used in traditional medicine. However, it is less well-known than other cinchona species for its medicinal properties. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
