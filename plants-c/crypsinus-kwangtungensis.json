    "intro": "Crypsinus kwangtungensis, commonly known as the Guangdong cryptsine, is a rare flowering plant native to southern China. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are typically ovate with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
