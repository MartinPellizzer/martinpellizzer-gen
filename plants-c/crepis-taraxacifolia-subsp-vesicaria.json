    "intro": "Crepis taraxacifolia subsp. vesicaria, commonly known as the bladderleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flower heads that are surrounded by pale green bracts. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a distinctive bladdery appearance due to the presence of inflated, bladder-like structures. This subspecies is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun."
