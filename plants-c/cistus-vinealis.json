    "intro": "Cistus vinealis, commonly known as rock rose or Portuguese heather, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, evergreen leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. Cistus vinealis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to support local wildlife."
