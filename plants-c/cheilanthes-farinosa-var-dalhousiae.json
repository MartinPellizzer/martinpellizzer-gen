    "intro": "Cheilanthes farinosa var. dalhousiae, commonly known as the Dalhousie's rockcap, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This variety is often found in mountainous and coastal areas where it forms dense, low-growing colonies."
