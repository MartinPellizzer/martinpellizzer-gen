    "intro": "Chuquiraga insignis var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved chuquiraga, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, dense clusters of yellow flowers. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in high-altitude areas with well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andes. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
