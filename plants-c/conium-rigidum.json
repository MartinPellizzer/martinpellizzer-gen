    "intro": "Conium rigidum, commonly known as hemlock, is a toxic plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and small, greenish-white flowers that grow in umbrella-like clusters. The leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded areas. Due to its highly poisonous nature, it is considered a dangerous weed and should be handled with care."
