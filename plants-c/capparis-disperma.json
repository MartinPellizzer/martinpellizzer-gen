    "intro": "Capparis disperma, commonly known as the desert caper, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Capparis disperma is well adapted to survive in extreme temperatures and low precipitation."
