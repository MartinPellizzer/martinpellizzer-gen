    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 ausserdorferi, commonly known as the Austrian thistle, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple to pink flower heads that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open areas, often found in mountainous regions of Central Europe. Its leaves are lance-shaped with rough, serrated edges, and the plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
