It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often variegated with pale green or white markings. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture. Cissus retivenia is also valued for its ability to climb and its potential medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
