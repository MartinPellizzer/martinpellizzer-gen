    "intro": "Cereus funkii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to produce large, fragrant flowers at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a strong, sweet scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Cereus funkii is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
