    "intro": "Cotyledon orbiculata, commonly known as the elephant's foot or buffalo horn plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, and often hairy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, and they can develop a reddish or purple hue when exposed to direct sunlight. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
