    "intro": "Coelandria andreemillariae, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, intricate floral structures. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are often pale or greenish in color, which helps it blend with its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
