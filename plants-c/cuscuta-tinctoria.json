    "intro": "Cuscuta tinctoria, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that begins with seeds germinating on the surface of host plants. The plant's stems are slender and twining, allowing it to wrap around and attach to its host. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and has been historically used for its red dye-producing properties. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants."
