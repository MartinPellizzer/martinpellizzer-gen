    "intro": "Chisocheton sogerensis, commonly known as the Soger's chisocheton, is a species of flowering plant in the family Meliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually greenish-yellow in color, and its fruits are woody capsules containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
