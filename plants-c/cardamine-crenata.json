    "intro": "Cardamine crenata, commonly known as the notched water-cress, is a small flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has trifoliate leaves with a distinctive notched or serrated edge, and it produces small white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its roots are often used in traditional herbal medicine, and it is also valued as a food plant for certain insect species. Cardamine crenata plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity."
