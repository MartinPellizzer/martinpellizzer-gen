    "intro": "Carex vesiculosa var. congesta, commonly known as the clustered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It has fibrous roots and narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
