    "intro": "Carex fracta, commonly known as the brokenleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green with a distinctive, slightly rough texture. Carex fracta typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to its ecological role in supporting insect life."
