    "intro": "Cousinia glaucopsis, commonly known as the blue-flowered cousinia, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in dense, silvery-gray hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-green hue, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptation. Cousinia glaucopsis is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
