It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found growing on rocky shores or sandy beaches. Its flowers bloom in late summer and early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Chavica maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
