    "intro": "Catimbium muticum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many areas where it is non-native."
