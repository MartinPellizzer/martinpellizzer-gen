    "intro": "Croton daphniphylloides, commonly known as the silver croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with silver and green patterns on its broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
