    "intro": "Cakile maritima var. hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean coast. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky coastal environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is often found in maritime ecosystems."
