    "intro": "Cardamine scutata subsp. regeliana, commonly known as Regel's watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five sepals and petals, typical of the genus Cardamine. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its subspecies status reflects adaptations to specific ecological conditions, making it a notable example of botanical specialization."
