    "intro": "Cardamine tuberosa var. velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features basal leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its tuberous roots are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to watercress. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland floors."
