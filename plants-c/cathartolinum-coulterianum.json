    "intro": "Cathartolinum coulterianum, commonly known as the Coulter's cathartolinum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is native to specific regions in the southwestern United States, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
