    "intro": "Cirsium echinatum var. willkommianum, commonly known as the Willkomm's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features a robust, spiny stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with dense, sharply pointed bracts. The plant produces large, showy purple to violet flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a single, terminal capitulum. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with a rough, hairy texture, and are often covered in spines. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
