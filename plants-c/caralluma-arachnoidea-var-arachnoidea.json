    "intro": "Caralluma arachnoidea var. arachnoidea, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, spiny stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming at night. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, reducing water loss through transpiration. This species is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
