    "intro": "Chaenopleura hypoleuca, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds with white veins that stand out against the green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. The botanical features of Chaenopleura hypoleuca make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of its native habitat."
