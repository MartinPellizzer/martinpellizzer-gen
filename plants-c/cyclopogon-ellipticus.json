    "intro": "Cyclopogon ellipticus, commonly known as the elliptic cyclopogon, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with spikelets that are often difficult to distinguish without a magnifying lens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
