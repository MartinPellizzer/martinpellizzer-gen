It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its striking color and unique morphology make it a notable species in ecological and botanical studies."
