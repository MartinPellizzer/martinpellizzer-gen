    "intro": "Carex longerostrata var. exaristata, commonly known as the long-beaked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
