    "intro": "Ceropteris calomelanos var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a variant of the common water fern native to Southeast Asia. It is a aquatic fern that thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
