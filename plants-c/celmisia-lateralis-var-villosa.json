It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. The flowers bloom in spring and attract various pollinators, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
