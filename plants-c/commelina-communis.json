    "intro": "Commelina communis, commonly known as spiderwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Commelinaceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which are often surrounded by three white or pale green bracts that resemble spider legs, giving it its common name. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, three-lobed leaves and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in wet soils. Spiderwort is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a common weed in disturbed areas."
