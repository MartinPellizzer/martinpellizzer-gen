    "intro": "Convolvulus lactescens, commonly known as the milkweed vine, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Convolvulus lactescens is often found growing along rocky outcrops and in disturbed soils, showing adaptability to harsh environments."
