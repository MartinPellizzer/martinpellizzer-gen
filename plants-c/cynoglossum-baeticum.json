It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy texture, and it is often found in open woodlands and along mountainous regions. Cynoglossum baeticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
