It features compound leaves with rounded lobes and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale blue. The plant thrives in partial to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and can be trained to climb trellises or walls. Clematis obtusifolia is relatively low maintenance but benefits from regular pruning to encourage flowering."
