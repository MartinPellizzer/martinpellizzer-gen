    "intro": "Chenopodium flavum, commonly known as yellow goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist soils along streambanks and wet meadows. The plant has alternate, ovate to rhomboidal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. The seeds are small, dry, and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
