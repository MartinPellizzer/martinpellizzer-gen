    "intro": "Ceratozamia whitelockiana, commonly known as the White's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia, and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces both male and female cones, which are typically separate on the same individual, a feature known as monoecious reproduction. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a significant component of its ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
