    "intro": "Capsella drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's knotweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by spherical seed pods that burst open to disperse seeds. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
