    "intro": "Capnoides decumbens, commonly known as the creeping capnoid, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its small, opposite leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, clustered in small inflorescences, and bloom during the wet season."
