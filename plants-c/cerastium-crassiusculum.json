    "intro": "Cerastium crassiusculum, commonly known as woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, fuzzy gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
