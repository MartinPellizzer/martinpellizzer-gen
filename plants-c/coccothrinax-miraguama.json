    "intro": "Coccothrinax miraguama, commonly known as the Miraguama palm, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Isle of Pines. It is a small to medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with a slender trunk and a crown of pinnate leaves. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish trunk and the presence of a basal rosette of leaves at the base. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces dark blue, fleshy fruits that are edible. This palm is well adapted to coastal and limestone habitats, showing resilience to salt spray and wind."
