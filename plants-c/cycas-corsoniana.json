    "intro": "Cycas corsoniana, commonly known as the Corson's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Guam in the Pacific. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and dense, feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Cycas corsoniana is adapted to grow in coastal and limestone soils, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and collection, it is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
