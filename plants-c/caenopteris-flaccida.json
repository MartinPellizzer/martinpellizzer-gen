    "intro": "Caenopteris flaccida, commonly known as the drooping wood fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, drooping fronds that are typically light green to brown in color. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves, or fronds, are pinnately compound, with a soft, leathery texture. Caenopteris flaccida thrives in humid, shaded woodlands and is often found growing on decaying logs or in rocky crevices."
