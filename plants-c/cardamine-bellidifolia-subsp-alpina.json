    "intro": "Cardamine bellidifolia subsp. alpina, commonly known as alpine watercress, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas. It has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in alpine meadows and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
