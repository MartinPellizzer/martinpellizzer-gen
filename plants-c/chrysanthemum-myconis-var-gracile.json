    "intro": "Chrysanthemum myconis var. gracile, commonly known as the slender chrysanthemum, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of China. It features finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers with a central disc surrounded by ray florets, blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and prolonged flowering period."
