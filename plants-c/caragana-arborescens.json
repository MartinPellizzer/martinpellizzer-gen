    "intro": "Caragana arborescens, commonly known as the tree pea or yellow larch, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold climates of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and compound leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in spring, followed by pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating poor soils and cold temperatures. Caragana arborescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in erosion control."
