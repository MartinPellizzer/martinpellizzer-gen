    "intro": "Crocus aphyllus, commonly known as the naked-crocus, is a species of flowering plant in the iris family. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only a single flower emerging from a bulbous stem. The plant produces a striking violet or purple flower with six petals and three sepals. It typically blooms in early spring and is native to parts of southern Europe and the Middle East. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
