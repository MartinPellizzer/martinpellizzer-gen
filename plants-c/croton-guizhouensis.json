    "intro": "Croton guizhouensis, commonly known as the Guizhou croton, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Guizhou Province in China. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage that varies from green to red and purple. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
