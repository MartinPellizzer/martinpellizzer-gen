    "intro": "Cynanchum edule, commonly known as edible milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves that are usually lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in umbels, which are followed by follicles containing toxic, milky sap. While the plant is named for its edibility, caution is advised as some parts may be harmful if not prepared properly. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
