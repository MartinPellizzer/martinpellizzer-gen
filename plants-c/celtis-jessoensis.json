    "intro": "Celtis jessoensis, commonly known as the Japanese hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Ulmaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, red-brown fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. Celtis jessoensis is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in forested areas, shrublands, and along stream banks. Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a valuable component of its native ecosystems."
