    "intro": "Cyclosorus brittoniae, commonly known as the Britton's cyclosorus, is a rare fern species native to the United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of its leaves, which are arranged in a distinctive circular pattern. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
