    "intro": "Calceolaria ascendens var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular calceolaria, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, hooded flowers that resemble small cups, with a distinctive bilobed lower lip. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are usually hairy and glandular, which helps in reducing water loss in its arid habitat. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
