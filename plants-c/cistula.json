    "intro": "Cistula, commonly known as the rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Plantaginaceae. It consists of about 100 species, predominantly found in Mediterranean regions and parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. These plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their aromatic, often hairy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Cistula species are adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often thriving in dry, sunny environments. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
