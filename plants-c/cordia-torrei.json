    "intro": "[WRONG START] Codia torrei, commonly known as the yellow cordia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by orange to red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Cordia torrei thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens and xeriscaping. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate salt spray, making it suitable for coastal environments."
