The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in rocky or loamy soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting early-season pollinators."
