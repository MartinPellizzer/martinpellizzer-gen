    "intro": "Cheilanthes speciosissima var. elata, commonly known as the elegant cliffbrake, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green, leathery fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive pale midrib. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found on cliffs or in crevices, where it receives ample sunlight. Its spore-bearing structures, or sori, are arranged in two rows along the underside of the fronds. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in arid gardens due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
