    "intro": "Chamaecytisus blockianus, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has slender, woody stems covered in fine, silky hairs, and its leaves are narrow, leathery, and evergreen. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used for erosion control and as a ground cover in arid environments."
