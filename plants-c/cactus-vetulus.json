    "intro": "Cactus vetulus, commonly known as the old man of the south, is a distinctive succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. Overall, Cactus vetulus is a hardy and visually appealing plant well adapted to desert conditions."
