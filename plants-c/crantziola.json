    "intro": "Crantziola, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Native to regions in Africa and Asia, it thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
