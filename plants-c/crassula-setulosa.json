    "intro": "Crassula setulosa, commonly known as the wooly crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, upright growth with dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are fleshy and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. This hardy plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its low maintenance requirements."
