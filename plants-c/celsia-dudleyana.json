    "intro": "Celsia dudleyana, commonly known as Dudley's celsia, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers. The plant features showy, blue to violet blossoms that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
