It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its attractive, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas or botanical gardens. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
