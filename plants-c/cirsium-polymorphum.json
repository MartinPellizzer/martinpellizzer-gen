    "intro": "Cirsium polymorphum, commonly known as the variable thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its spiny, lance-shaped leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are covered in stiff, glandular hairs, which contribute to its defensive properties against herbivores. Cirsium polymorphum is often found in subalpine and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
