    "intro": "Cyrtostemma, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their striking, often bioluminescent flowers that emit a faint glow in the dark. Cyrtostemma species typically grow as herbaceous perennials or shrubs, with hairy stems and small, alternate leaves. They are valued in horticulture for their unique appearance and are often cultivated in shaded, moist environments."
