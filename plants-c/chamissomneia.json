    "intro": "Chamissomneia, commonly known as the \"moonflower of the Andes,\" is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, pale white flowers that open only at night. The plant has a compact, herbaceous structure with hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Chamissomneia produces small, bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain bird species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
