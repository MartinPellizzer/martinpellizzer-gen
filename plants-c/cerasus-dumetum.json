    "intro": "Cerasus dumetum, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or European dwarf cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically red or black when mature, though they are not as widely cultivated as other cherry species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and hedging. Cerasus dumetum is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
