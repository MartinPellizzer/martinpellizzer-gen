    "intro": "Camissonia hilgardii, commonly known as the Hilgard's camissonia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheats and sorrels. This species is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny areas such as meadows and slopes."
