    "intro": "Cyathea arnecornelii, commonly known as the Arnold's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome is thick and stores nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. The fronds are typically evergreen and contribute to the plant's ornamental value in horticulture."
