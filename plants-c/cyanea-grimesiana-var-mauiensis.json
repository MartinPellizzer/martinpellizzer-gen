    "intro": "Cyanea grimesiana var. mauiensis, commonly known as Maui's sea hibiscus, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family, characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or rocky soils with ample sunlight. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting local pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of Hawaiian ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
