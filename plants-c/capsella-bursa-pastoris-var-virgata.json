    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris var. virgata, commonly known as the velvetleaf chickweed, is a variant of the common weed species Capsella bursa-pastoris. It is characterized by its hairy, heart-shaped leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its reproductive strategy involves producing small, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds easily through wind. The botanical features of this variant make it adaptable to various environments, contributing to its widespread distribution."
