    "intro": "Croton serratifolius f. tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly croton, is a tropical shrub characterized by its distinctive, serrated leaves covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a rough texture due to the presence of the tomentose pubescence. The flowers are small and clustered, often hidden within cup-like structures called cyathia, which is a common feature in the Euphorbiaceae family. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value, though it can be toxic if ingested."
