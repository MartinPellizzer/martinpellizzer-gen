    "intro": "Coffea nodosa, commonly known as the nodding coffee. It is a small evergreen shrub native to Madagascar, characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive nodding flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee. It is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal. Due to its unique appearance and limited cultivation, it is considered a rare and less commercially significant species compared to other coffee plants."
