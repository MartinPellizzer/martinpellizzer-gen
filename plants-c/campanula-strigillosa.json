    "intro": "Campanula strigillosa, commonly known as the rough bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically hairy and have a rough texture, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Campanula strigillosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
