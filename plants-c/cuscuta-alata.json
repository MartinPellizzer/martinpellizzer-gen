    "intro": "Cuscuta alata, commonly known as the winged dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is characterized by its wing-like structures on its stems, which give it its common name. It is found in various regions, including North America, and can parasitize a wide range of plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants."
