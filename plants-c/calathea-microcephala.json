    "intro": "Calathea microcephala, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, patterned leaves that change color and orientation throughout the day, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent humidity and well-draining soil. Its foliage displays intricate patterns in shades of green, silver, and pink, making it a popular ornamental plant. Calathea microcephala is relatively low maintenance but sensitive to temperature fluctuations and overwatering."
