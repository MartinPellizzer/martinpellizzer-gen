    "intro": "Cypella linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cypella, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its linear, grass-like leaves are arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Cypella linearis is often used in coastal gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value."
