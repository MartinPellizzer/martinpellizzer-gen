    "intro": "Conopodium stenocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruit burrweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, compound leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, dry fruits that are often covered in hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
