    "intro": "Corynemyrtus corynantha, commonly known as the yellow box, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy on top and paler underneath. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters during spring, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and woodland habitats. Corynemyrtus corynantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
