    "intro": "Carex arenaria var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate sand sedge, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically silver-gray in color, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize sandy soils, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
