    "intro": "Couthovia pachyantha, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its elongated, silver-gray leaves that reflect sunlight, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale blue, often blooming during the cooler months. Its root system is adapted to store moisture, allowing it to survive prolonged dry periods. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts."
