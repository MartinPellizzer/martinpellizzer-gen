    "intro": "Ceropegia decumbens, commonly known as the string of hearts, is a trailing plant native to South Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or yellow, often with a distinctive hood-like structure. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Ceropegia decumbens is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
