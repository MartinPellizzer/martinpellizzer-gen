    "intro": "Cousinia assasinorum, commonly known as the assassin's thorn, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh environments with its deep root system and succulent leaves that store water. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is avoided by grazing animals and has a limited ecological role in its native range."
