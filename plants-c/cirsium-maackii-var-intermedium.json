    "intro": "Cirsium maackii var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features spiny, glaucous leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pinkish-blue flowers in a spherical shape, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along streambanks. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural or natural habitats."
