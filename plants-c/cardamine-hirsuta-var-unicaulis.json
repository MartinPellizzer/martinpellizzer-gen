    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. unicaulis, commonly known as the single-stemed water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, calcareous habitats. It features basal leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet having a serrated margin. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring. Its unique characteristic is the presence of a single, unbranched stem, distinguishing it from other varieties of Cardamine. This variant is often found in stream banks and wet meadows, where it thrives in cool, shaded environments."
