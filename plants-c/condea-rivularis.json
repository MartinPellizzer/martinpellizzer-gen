    "intro": "Condea rivularis, commonly known as the river thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear yellow, dandelion-like composite flowers. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, clay-rich soils. Condea rivularis plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
