    "intro": "Chthamalia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered rockweed, is a marine red alga found in intertidal zones along the Pacific coast of North America. It typically grows on rocky substrates and is characterized by its branching, filamentous thallus. The plant has a distinctive two-flowered structure, with small, clustered reproductive structures called conceptacles. It plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms. Chthamalia biflora is adapted to withstand tidal forces and fluctuating salinity levels, making it a resilient component of rocky shore communities."
