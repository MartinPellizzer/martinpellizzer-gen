    "intro": "Cassandra calyculata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cassava, is a variant of the cassava plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and a woody stem that becomes fibrous as it matures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by round, green fruits that turn yellow when mature. Its roots are the primary edible part, used in various culinary preparations across its native regions. This variety is valued for its adaptability to different soil types and its role in both subsistence and commercial agriculture."
