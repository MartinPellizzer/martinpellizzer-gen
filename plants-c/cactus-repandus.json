    "intro": "Cactus repandus, commonly known as the clustered cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, providing a compact appearance. The plant features spines that vary in length and color, serving as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cactus repandus is well adapted to harsh desert environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
