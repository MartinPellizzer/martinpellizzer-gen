    "intro": "Calystegia palmatopinnata, commonly known as the broad-leaved morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a palmate-pinnate venation pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or white, blooming in the morning. Its rapid growth habit makes it both ornamental and potentially invasive in certain environments. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its spread."
