    "intro": "Collare-stuartense dracoceps, commonly known as the Stuart's dragonhead, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, spiky inflorescence and vibrant blue to purple flowers, which bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a compact, herbaceous growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
