    "intro": "Cissus violaceoglandulosa, commonly known as the purple glandular cissus, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive purple-tinged stems and small, heart-shaped leaves with glandular structures. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
