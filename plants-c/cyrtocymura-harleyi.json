It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
