    "intro": "Cyperus panamensis var. ramiger, commonly known as the Panama sedge, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its dense, clump-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. This variant is notable for its distinctive branching structure, which distinguishes it from other members of the Cyperus genus."
