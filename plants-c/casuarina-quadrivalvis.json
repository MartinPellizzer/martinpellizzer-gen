    "intro": "Casuarina quadrivalvis, commonly known as the coastal casuarina, is a hardy, evergreen shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like foliage that resembles the appearance of a pine tree. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It produces woody, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Casuarina quadrivalvis is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
