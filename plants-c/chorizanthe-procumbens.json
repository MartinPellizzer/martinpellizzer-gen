    "intro": "Chorizanthe procumbens, commonly known as desert sand verbena, is a low-growing annual plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, adapted to withstand harsh desert conditions. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Chorizanthe procumbens is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
