    "intro": "Clintonia udensis, commonly known as the white-flowered Clintonia, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has lance-shaped leaves that are often matted together at the base. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Clintonia udensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
