    "intro": "Cuscuta chrysocoma, commonly known as golden dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant is often found growing on various host species, including shrubs and trees, in a variety of habitats. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can sometimes cause damage to its host plants, though it is not typically considered a major agricultural pest."
