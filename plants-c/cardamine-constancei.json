    "intro": "Cardamine constancei, commonly known as the Constant's watercress, is a rare and delicate member of the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, kidney-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its leaves are often submerged or partially submerged, adapting to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
