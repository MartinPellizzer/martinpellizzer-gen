    "intro": "Cyperus perennis, commonly known as the everlasting grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, three-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or damp environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Cyperus perennis is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its tolerance to fluctuating water levels. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a natural water filter."
