    "intro": "Cruzeta vermicularis, commonly known as the creeping crosswort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to South America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in the spring. Its root system is fibrous and can spread extensively, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. Cruzeta vermicularis is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
