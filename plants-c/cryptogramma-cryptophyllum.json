    "intro": "Cryptogramma cryptophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cryptogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Cryptogramma cryptophyllum is primarily distributed in the southern United States and parts of Mexico."
