    "intro": "Cypripedium insigne, commonly known as the noble lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that resemble a cascade of hair. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Cypripedium insigne is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also of interest to botanists due to its ecological and evolutionary significance."
