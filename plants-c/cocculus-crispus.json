    "intro": "Cocculus crispus, commonly known as the prickly morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with wavy edges and produces showy, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant has distinctive, spiny stems and is often found in woodland areas or along fences. Its fruit is a rough, warty capsule that splits open to release seeds. Cocculus crispus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
