    "intro": "Carex riparia subsp. chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean riparian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It typically grows in moist, often riparian environments such as riverbanks and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in dense clumps, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in wet or semi-aquatic conditions, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems. Its botanical features make it well-suited for ecological restoration projects in wetland habitats."
