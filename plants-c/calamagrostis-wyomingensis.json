    "intro": "Calamagrostis wyomingensis, commonly known as Wyoming grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open plains and grasslands. Wyoming grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in late summer, contributing to its ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
