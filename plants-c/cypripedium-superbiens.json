This perennial herbaceous plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense clusters of showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The leaves are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and the plant produces a single, elongated flower spike. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
