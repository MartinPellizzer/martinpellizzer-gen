    "intro": "Campanula persicifolia var. lasiocalyx, commonly known as the velvet bellflower, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, often with a white throat. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring through early summer."
