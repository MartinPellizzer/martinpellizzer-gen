    "intro": "Commiphora sarandensis subsp. moyaleensis, commonly known as the Moyale myrrh tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by the secretion of a resinous gum. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Its resin, known as moyale myrrh, has been traditionally used in incense and medicinal applications. The species is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes."
