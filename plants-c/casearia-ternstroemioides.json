    "intro": "Casearia ternstroemioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved casearia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
