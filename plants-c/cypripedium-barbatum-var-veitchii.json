    "intro": "Cypripedium barbatum var. veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. The plant features a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces a single, upright stem with a few broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific insects, and it thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
