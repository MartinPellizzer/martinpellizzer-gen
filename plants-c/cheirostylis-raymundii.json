    "intro": "Cheirostylis raymundii, commonly known as the Raymond's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescence and striking, pale yellow to white flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its botanical features include narrow, linear leaves and a unique floral structure that resembles a ghostly apparition. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a critically endangered species."
