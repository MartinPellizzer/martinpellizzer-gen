    "intro": "Corylus avellana f. fuscorubra, commonly known as the red-hair hazel, is a cultivar of the hazel tree characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown foliage. This variety exhibits unique leaf coloration, with young leaves appearing reddish-purple before maturing to a deep green. The plant produces small, edible nuts similar to those of the common hazel, though its ornamental value is often more appreciated than its culinary use. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil. The red-hair hazel is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in gardens and landscapes."
