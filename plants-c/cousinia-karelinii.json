    "intro": "Cousinia karelinii, commonly known as the Karakoram hawk's-beak, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Cousinia karelinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
