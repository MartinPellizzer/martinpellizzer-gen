    "intro": "Cornopteris latibasis, commonly known as the broad-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically bipinnate. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered into sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Cornopteris latibasis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in natural habitats."
