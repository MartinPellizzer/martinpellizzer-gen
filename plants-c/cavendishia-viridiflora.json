    "intro": "Cavendishia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapted to its arid environment. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with greenish veins, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature common in many cacti. Cavendishia viridiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
