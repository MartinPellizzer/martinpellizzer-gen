    "intro": "Ctenopteris immersa, commonly known as the water hakea, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in water, adapting to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The plant has a creeping rhizome that helps it spread across wetland environments, forming dense colonies. Its spores are produced in sori that are covered by a thin, membranous indusium, typical of many ferns. Ctenopteris immersa thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater, making it a common sight in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams."
