    "intro": "Cnicus eriocephalus, commonly known as the goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with a fuzzy, hairy center that resembles a beard, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are alternate, lobed, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Cnicus eriocephalus is an annual or biennial plant that produces small, oval-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
