    "intro": "Castilleja rustica, commonly known as the Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid red bracts that resemble paintbrush strokes. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to parasitize the roots of nearby host plants, such as grasses and shrubs. Its flowers are typically tubular and are pollinated by bees and other insects. Castilleja rustica thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows and open woodlands."
