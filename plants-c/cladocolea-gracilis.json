    "intro": "Cladocolea gracilis, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock faces or in humid forest understories. Its small, spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of ferns. Cladocolea gracilis is known for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
