    "intro": "Cirsium cryptocephalum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and silvery-gray, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a spherical inflorescence. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Cirsium cryptocephalum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
