    "intro": "Calanthe liukiuensis, commonly known as the Ryukyu calanthe, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and features showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette, and its inflorescence consists of a single, upright spike bearing several flowers. Calanthe liukiuensis thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
