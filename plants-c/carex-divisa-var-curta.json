    "intro": "Carex divisa var. curta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-pollinated flowers, and it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting wetland ecosystems. Carex divisa var. curta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in diverse wetland conditions."
