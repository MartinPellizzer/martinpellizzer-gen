    "intro": "Cyathea subuliformis, commonly known as the slender sword fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a narrow, needle-like shape that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Cyathea subuliformis plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
