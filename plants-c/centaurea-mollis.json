    "intro": "Centaurea mollis, commonly known as the sweet centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers and spiny, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Centaurea mollis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
