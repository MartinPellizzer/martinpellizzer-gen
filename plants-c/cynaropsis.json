    "intro": "Cynaropsis, commonly known as the milkweed tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, often yellow or orange flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including livestock. Cynaropsis species typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their drought-resistant features. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine."
