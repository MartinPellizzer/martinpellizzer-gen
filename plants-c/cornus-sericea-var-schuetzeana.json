    "intro": "Cornus sericea var. schuetzeana, commonly known as Schuetze's silky dogwood, is a variant of the silky dogwood native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small white flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas and wetlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
