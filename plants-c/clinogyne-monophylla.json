It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant is characterized by its single, broad, lance-shaped leaf and its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Clinogyne monophylla thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.
