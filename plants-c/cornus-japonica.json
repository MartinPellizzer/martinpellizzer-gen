    "intro": "Cornus japonica, commonly known as the Japanese dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its showy, white or pink bracts that appear in early spring, often mistaken for flowers. The plant has simple, opposite, elliptical leaves that turn vibrant shades of red or orange in the fall. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by red berries, which are an important food source for birds. Cornus japonica thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens."
