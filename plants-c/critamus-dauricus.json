    "intro": "Critamus dauricus, commonly known as the Daurian yellowwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountains of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Betulaceae, which includes birches and alders, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant produces small, winged fruits that disperse via wind, a common adaptation in its native habitat. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation projects."
