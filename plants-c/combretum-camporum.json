    "intro": "Combretum camporum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
