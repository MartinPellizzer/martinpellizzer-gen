    "intro": "Cleisostoma scolopendrifolium, commonly known as the spider-leaf orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
