    "intro": "Ctenopteris suprasculpta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea holly, is a species of cycad from the family Cycadaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of southern China, the Philippines, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves with a feathery appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a leathery texture, adapted to withstand salty air and wind. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody, cone-like structures that contain seeds."
