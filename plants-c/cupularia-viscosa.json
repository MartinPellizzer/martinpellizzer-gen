    "intro": "Cupularia viscosa, commonly known as the sticky cupularia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. The sticky secretions on its leaves may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and pests."
