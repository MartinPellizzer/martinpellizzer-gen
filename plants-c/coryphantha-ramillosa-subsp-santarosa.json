    "intro": "Coryphantha ramillosa subsp. santarosa, commonly known as Santa Rosa hedgehog cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a dense cluster of cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is well adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in landscaping."
