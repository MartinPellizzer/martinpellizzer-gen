    "intro": "Correllia montana, commonly known as the mountain coralroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in coniferous or mixed forests. Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed forest ecosystems."
