    "intro": "Crotalaria friesii, commonly known as the yellow crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Crotalaria friesii is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in certain agricultural contexts."
