    "intro": "Clivia gardenii var. citrina, commonly known as the Citrine Clivia, is a striking evergreen perennial native to South Africa. It features dark green, strap-like leaves that form a dense rosette, and produces clusters of bright yellow, bell-shaped flowers during the winter months. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardens and shaded outdoor spaces. Its vibrant blooms and foliage make it an excellent addition to any botanical collection."
