    "intro": "Cogswellia gormanii, commonly known as the Gorman's cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a dense, spiny covering that helps protect it from herbivores and intense sunlight. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
