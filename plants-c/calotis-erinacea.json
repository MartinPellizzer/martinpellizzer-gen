    "intro": "Calotis erinacea, commonly known as the woolly calotis, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant features a hairy, spherical stem covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a dense, spherical cluster at the top of the stem. Calotis erinacea is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
