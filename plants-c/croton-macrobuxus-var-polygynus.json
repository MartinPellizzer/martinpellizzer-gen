    "intro": "Croton macrobuxus var. polygynus, commonly known as the African croton, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along riverbanks. The plant has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, though its toxicity requires caution in handling."
