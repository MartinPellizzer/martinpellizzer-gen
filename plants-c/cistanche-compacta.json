    "intro": "Cistanche compacta, commonly known as the desert tuber or Indian rhubarb, is a parasitic plant native to arid regions of Asia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on species of the genus Hedera. Its structure consists of a fleshy, branched stem covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers and is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to its unique biology and habitat, it is often found in sandy soils and rocky areas."
