It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and clusters of yellow, pendulous flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. Its botanical features make it valuable for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
