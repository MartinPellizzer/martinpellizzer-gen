    "intro": "Crocus vernus var. bicolor, commonly known as the double crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to Europe. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers with two rows of petals, typically in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears the blooms in early spring. Its leaves are grass-like and emerge after the flowers have faded. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings."
