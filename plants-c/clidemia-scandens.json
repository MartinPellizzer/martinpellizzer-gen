It is a woody vine that typically grows along forest edges and in disturbed areas, often climbing or trailing along the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are heart-shaped, hairy, and have a silvery underside, giving it a distinctive appearance.
