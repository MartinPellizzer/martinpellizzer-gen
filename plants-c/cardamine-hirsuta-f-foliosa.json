    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta f. foliosa, commonly known as the hairy watercress, is a variant of the common watercress species. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland areas. It produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in a raceme, which are followed by small, round seed pods. The foliage is often used in salads or as a garnish due to its peppery flavor."
