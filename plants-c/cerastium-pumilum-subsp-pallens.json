    "intro": "Cerastium pumilum subsp. pallens, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically forms dense mats of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes."
