    "intro": "Cerastium diffusum var. sennenii, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are oval, hairy, and arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. This species is often found in disturbed habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
