    "intro": "Centropogon grandis, commonly known as the giant spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Centropogon grandis is often found in marshy areas and is adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils."
