    "intro": "Casuarina humilis var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the coastal casuarina, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like foliage and small, woody cones that contain the seeds. The plant is adapted to sandy, saline soils and is often found in coastal dunes and estuarine environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife. Its growth habit and resilience make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
