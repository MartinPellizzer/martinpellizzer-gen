    "intro": "Caroxylon pillansii, commonly known as the Pillans's boerma. It is a succulent shrub native to South Africa, characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically small and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Caroxylon pillansii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
