    "intro": "Capsella exotica, commonly known as the exotic catchweed. It is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, white or purple flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
