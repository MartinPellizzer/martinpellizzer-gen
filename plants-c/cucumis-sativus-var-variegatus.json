    "intro": "Cucumis sativus var. variegatus, commonly known as the variegated cucumber, is a botanical variant of the common cucumber. It is characterized by its distinctive mottled or variegated leaf patterns, which result from genetic mutations affecting chlorophyll distribution. The plant typically grows as an annual vine, producing cucumbers that are often smaller and more flavorful than standard varieties. Its foliage provides shade, which can help regulate temperature and moisture in the soil. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes as well as for its edible fruit."
