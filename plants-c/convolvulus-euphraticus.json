It is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, yellow or white flowers with five petals. The plant has hairy, creeping stems that often form dense mats, allowing it to thrive in disturbed soils and rocky habitats. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Convolvulus euphraticus is adapted to survive in drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
