    "intro": "Carpinus turczaninovii var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the ovalleaf hornbeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Far East. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm long and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins during early spring, followed by small, round nuts enclosed in a woody husk.

The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and hardy nature."
