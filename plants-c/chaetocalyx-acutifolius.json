It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are deeply lobed and have a sharp, pointed appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or near water sources. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
