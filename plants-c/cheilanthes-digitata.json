    "intro": "Cheilanthes digitata, commonly known as the fingered rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often adorned with fine, finger-like projections. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent-like leaves. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. Cheilanthes digitata is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal."
