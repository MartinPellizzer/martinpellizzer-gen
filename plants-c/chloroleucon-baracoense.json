    "intro": "Chloroleucon baracoense, commonly known as the Baracoense daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, exhibiting adaptations to salt spray and wind exposure. Its bright yellow flowers bloom during the dry season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
