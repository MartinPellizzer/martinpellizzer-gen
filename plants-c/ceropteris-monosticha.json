    "intro": "Ceropteris monosticha, commonly known as the single-veined water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green and have a single central vein. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. Ceropteris monosticha plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
