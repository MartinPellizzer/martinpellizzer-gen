    "intro": "Convolvulus arvensis var. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf field bindweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, pale yellow flowers with five petals and a distinctive spurred shape, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be invasive in agricultural areas. Its rapid growth and extensive root system make it a persistent weed in cultivated fields."
