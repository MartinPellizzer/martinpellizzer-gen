    "intro": "Carex rostellifera, commonly known as the rosette sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it forms dense clumps that help stabilize soil. Carex rostellifera plays a vital role in providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
