    "intro": "Coffea glabra, commonly known as the African coffee or the slender coffee, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries containing two seeds. These seeds, when roasted and ground, can be used to make coffee, though it is less commonly cultivated than other coffee species. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
