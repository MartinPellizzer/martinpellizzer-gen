    "intro": "Claytonia spathulata var. disciformis, commonly known as the broad-leafed spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with rosettes of broad, waxy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers with showy, rounded petals that resemble a saucer shape. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. This variety is closely related to other Claytonia species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
