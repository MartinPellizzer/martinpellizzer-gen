    "intro": "Cyathea firmula, commonly known as the firmula tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and enabling it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Cyathea firmula is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is valued for its ability to create a lush, tropical appearance in gardens."
