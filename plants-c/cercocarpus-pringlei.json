    "intro": "Cercocarpus pringlei, commonly known as the Sierra sand verbena, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, woody fruits called\u575a\u679c (nuts) that are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
