    "intro": "Carpobrotus concavus, commonly known as the coast fig, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, prostrate stems and broad, waxy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant orange flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky areas. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
