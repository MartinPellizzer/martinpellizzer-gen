It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant features white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring.

Copiapoa alticostata is adapted to arid conditions, storing water in its thick stem and relying on minimal rainfall for survival."
