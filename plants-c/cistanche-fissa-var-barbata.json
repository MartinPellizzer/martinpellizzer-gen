    "intro": "Cistanche fissa var. barbata, commonly known as the hairy parasitic sandmat, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from its host plants while also performing photosynthesis. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia, it thrives in sandy soils and often grows on shrubs and trees. The plant has fleshy, yellowish stems and produces small, pale flowers. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported tonic and rejuvenating properties."
