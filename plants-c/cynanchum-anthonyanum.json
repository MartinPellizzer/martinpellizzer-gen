    "intro": "Cynanchum anthonyanum, commonly known as Anthony's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in umbels, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems and a slow growth cycle. Cynanchum anthonyanum is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine."
