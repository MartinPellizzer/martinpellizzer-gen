    "intro": "Calycopteris floribunda, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, compact foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a grayish-green hue that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Calycopteris floribunda is known for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
