    "intro": "Cerberiopsis, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is native to the coastal regions of Australia and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to saline environments. Cerberiopsis species are shrubs or small trees, often with woody stems and a sprawling growth habit. Their flowers, which can be pink, red, or yellow, bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
