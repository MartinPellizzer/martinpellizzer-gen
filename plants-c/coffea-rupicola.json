    "intro": "Coffea rupicola, commonly known as the rock coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the highlands of Ethiopia and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red berries containing two seeds, which are used to make a unique type of coffee. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found growing on rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coffea rupicola is considered a rare and endangered species."
