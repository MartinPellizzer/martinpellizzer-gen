    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe floribunda, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a protective shield-like structure around its stems. The plant produces small, bright yellow spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for tropical terrariums and greenhouses. Due to its ornamental value and rarity in the wild, it is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
