    "intro": "Ceratophyllum granulosum, commonly known as the spiked watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that give it a unique, feathery appearance. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are clustered in spike-like formations, which are often submerged or just at the water's surface. Ceratophyllum granulosum is a fast-growing plant that can form dense mats, influencing water clarity and aquatic ecosystems. It is often used in pond management for its ability to control algae and provide habitat for aquatic life."
