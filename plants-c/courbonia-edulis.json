    "intro": "Courbonia edulis, commonly known as the edible courbonia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its palm-like appearance with a smooth, slender trunk. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible fruits that are rich in nutrients. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, providing shade and contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat. Courbonia edulis is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its potential as a food source in traditional diets."
