    "intro": "Chlorophytum affine, commonly known as the spider plant, is a member of the Asparagaceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its long, arching leaves that often have a white or yellow stripe down the center. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright orange berries. It is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that thrives in well-drained soil and bright, indirect light. Chlorophytum affine is popular as a houseplant due to its ability to purify indoor air and its ease of propagation through its offsets."
