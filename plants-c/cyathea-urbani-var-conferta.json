    "intro": "Cyathea urbani var. conferta, commonly known as the dense-ferning tree-fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a thick layer of dead fronds, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its role in maintaining forest biodiversity."
