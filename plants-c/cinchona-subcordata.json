    "intro": "Cinchona subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf quinine tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves and produces small, white to pinkish flowers. It is notable for its medicinal properties, as it is a source of quinine, used historically in the treatment of malaria. The tree typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters."
