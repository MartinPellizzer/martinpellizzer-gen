    "intro": "Calosmon benzoin, commonly known as benzoin, is a tropical plant native to the islands of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap, which is often used in perfumery and traditional medicine. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, while the fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds. The resin, known as benzoin gum, is harvested from the tree's trunk and has a sweet, balsamic scent."
