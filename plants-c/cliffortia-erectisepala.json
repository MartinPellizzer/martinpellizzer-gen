    "intro": "Cliffortia erectisepala, commonly known as the upright-leaved cliffortia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often on mountain slopes and cliffs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red in color. Its leaves are narrow and upright, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cliffortia erectisepala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
