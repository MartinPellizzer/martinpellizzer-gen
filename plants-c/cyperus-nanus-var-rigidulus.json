    "intro": "Cyperus nanus var. rigidulus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, thread-like hairs. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive rigid texture that gives the variety its name. The inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikelets that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers."
