    "intro": "Catalpa syringifolia var. aureovittata, commonly known as the golden-banded catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that often display a golden or yellowish stripe along the midrib. The tree produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in long, pendulous clusters. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, fertile soils along riverbanks. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks."
