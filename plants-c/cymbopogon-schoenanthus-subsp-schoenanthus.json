    "intro": "Cymbopogon schoenanthus subsp. schoenanthus, commonly known as the narrowleaf lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that emit a strong lemon scent due to the presence of citral and other volatile oils. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and prefers well-drained soils in full sun. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and digestive properties. It is also cultivated for its essential oils, which are used in perfumes and as a flavoring agent."
