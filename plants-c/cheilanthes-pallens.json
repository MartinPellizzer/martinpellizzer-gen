    "intro": "Cheilanthes pallens, commonly known as the rock fern or stone fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizome and small, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant is adapted to grow on rocky substrates and in crevices, where it can retain moisture in dry environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes pallens is a resilient plant that thrives in low-nutrient soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
