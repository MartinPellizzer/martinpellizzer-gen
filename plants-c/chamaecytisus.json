    "intro": "Chamaecytisus, commonly known as sweet shrub, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These shrubs are native to the Mediterranean region and are characterized by their dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, pea-like flowers. The leaves are typically leathery and glossy, while the stems are often covered in fine hairs. Chamaecytisus species are often used in landscaping for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. They are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen, making them beneficial in soil enrichment."
