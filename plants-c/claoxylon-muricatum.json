    "intro": "Claoxylon muricatum, commonly known as the rough-seeded claoxylon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, bark-like trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
