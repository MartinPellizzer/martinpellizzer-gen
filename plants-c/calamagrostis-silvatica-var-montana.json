    "intro": "Calamagrostis silvatica var. montana, commonly known as mountain wood reed, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features tall, slender culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver on the underside. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in woodland environments."
