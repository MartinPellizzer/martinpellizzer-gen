    "intro": "Chione venosa var. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican ghostflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has a short, upright stem with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
