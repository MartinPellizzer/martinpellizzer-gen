    "intro": "Cuscuta schkuhriana, commonly known as the Schkuhriana dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or yellow in color. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called haustoria, which attach to the host plant and extract water and nutrients. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, often parasitizing shrubs and grasses. Its life cycle involves seed dispersal through the wind, allowing it to colonize new host plants efficiently."
