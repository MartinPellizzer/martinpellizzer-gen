    "intro": "Crepis atribarba var. cytotaxonomicorum, commonly known as the cytotaxonomic crepis, is a rare variant of the crepis genus native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinct morphology, including narrow leaves and small, yellowish flowers. This variant is notable for its unique cytological features, which have led to its classification as a separate taxonomic form. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous areas. Its study is important for understanding genetic diversity and evolutionary relationships within the Crepis genus."
