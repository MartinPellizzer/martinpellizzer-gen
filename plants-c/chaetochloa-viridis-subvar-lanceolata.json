    "intro": "Chaetochloa viridis subvar. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf green hairgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, greenish-brown florets. Its leaves are usually covered with fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
