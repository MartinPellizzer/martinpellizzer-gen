    "intro": "Cereus calcirupicola var. cipoensis, commonly known as the Cipo Cereus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a common trait among many cacti. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in arid, rocky environments. This variety is particularly adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation."
