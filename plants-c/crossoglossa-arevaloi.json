    "intro": "Crossoglossa arevaloi, commonly known as the Arevalo's crossoglossa, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a distinctive cross-shaped lip that sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests where humidity is high. Its flowers are usually small and pale, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Crossoglossa arevaloi is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
