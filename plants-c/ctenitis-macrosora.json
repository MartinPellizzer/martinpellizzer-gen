    "intro": "Ctenitis macrosora, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a striking species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for centuries, making it a long-lived component of its ecosystem. Its fronds are typically light green and have a distinctive, segmented appearance, while its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize the soil. Ctenitis macrosora plays an important role in providing habitat and shade in the understory of tropical forests."
