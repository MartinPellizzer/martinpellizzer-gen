It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves and stems that help it retain moisture in its harsh alpine habitat. It typically grows in rocky soils and open meadows at high elevations. Cerastium cavanillesianum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
