    "intro": "Chelyella gomeziana, commonly known as the Gomezian shield fern, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures are well-developed, with sporangia arranged in clusters on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Chelyella gomeziana is considered a species of conservation concern."
