    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 sennenii, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Cirsium vulgare and Cirsium horridulum, resulting in a plant with distinctive, spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers. The species is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its robust growth and showy flowers make it a notable ornamental plant, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
