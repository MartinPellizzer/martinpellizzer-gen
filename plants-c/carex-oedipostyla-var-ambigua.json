    "intro": "Carex oedipostyla var. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, and it thrives in full to partial sunlight. This variety is distinguished by its subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Carex oedipostyla."
