    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis lenticellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironwood, is a member of the Fagaceae family, characterized by its hard, durable wood and evergreen foliage. It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces small, chestnut-like fruits that are encased in a spiny husk, which splits open to release winged seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), with a prominent midrib and a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Cyclobalanopsis lenticellata is valued for its ecological importance and is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
