It has a distinctive branching structure that resembles the antlers of a stag, hence its common name. The plant grows in dense mats on rocky substrates, often in intertidal zones. It thrives in nutrient-rich waters and plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine organisms. Its color ranges from dark purple to reddish-brown, depending on the depth and light conditions."
