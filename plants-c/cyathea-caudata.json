    "intro": "Cyathea caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed tree fern, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant grows slowly and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in its natural habitat. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting the plant's vertical growth. Cyathea caudata is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its distinctive appearance and air-purifying qualities."
