    "intro": "Cactus opuntia var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf prickly pear, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its thick, succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The broad leaves, which are more pronounced than in other Opuntia species, contribute to its unique appearance and ecological role."
