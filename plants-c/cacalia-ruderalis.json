It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in abandoned fields, making it a common weed in such environments. It produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Cacalia ruderalis is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its resilience to environmental stress."
