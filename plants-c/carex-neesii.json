    "intro": "Carex neesii, commonly known as the Nees' sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex neesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
