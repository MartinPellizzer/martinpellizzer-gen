It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its sweet, juicy flesh and a single, hard pit. The fruit develops from a five-lobed flower and typically ripens in late summer to early autumn. This variety is prized for its flavor and is widely cultivated for both fresh consumption and processing into jams and canned fruit."
