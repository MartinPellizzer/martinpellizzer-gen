    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 hybridum, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
