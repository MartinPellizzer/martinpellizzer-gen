    "intro": "Cereus lindmanii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night and close by dawn. These flowers are typically borne at the tips of the stems and are known for their striking appearance. Cereus lindmanii is a popular choice for desert gardens due to its low maintenance and dramatic floral display."
