    "intro": "Clinostigma savoryanum, commonly known as the Armenian rock cress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are pinnately divided with a slightly hairy surface. Clinostigma savoryanum is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. It is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine."
