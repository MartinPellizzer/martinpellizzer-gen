    "intro": "Cyclopogon bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored cyclopogon, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, two-toned flowers that are typically pink and white, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshy areas near freshwater sources. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
