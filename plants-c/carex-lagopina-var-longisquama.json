    "intro": "Carex lagopina var. longisquama, commonly known as the long-squama sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, three-ranked spikelets, which are usually green to reddish in color. This variety is distinguished by its elongated, scale-like bracts and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological value."
