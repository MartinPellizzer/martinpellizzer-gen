    "intro": "Chrysothamnus occidentalis, commonly known as the western goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-green foliage and produces small, yellow flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The western goldenbush is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping."
