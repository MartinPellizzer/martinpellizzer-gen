It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from yellow to red. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.

Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
