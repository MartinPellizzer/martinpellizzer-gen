It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it a hardy species. Its seeds are sometimes used as a food source by both humans and livestock in certain regions."
