    "intro": "Cardamine savensis var. glabra, commonly known as smooth water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in shallow water habitats. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless leaf surfaces, setting it apart from other Cardamine species."
