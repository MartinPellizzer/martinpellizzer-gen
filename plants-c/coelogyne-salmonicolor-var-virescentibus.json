    "intro": "Coelogyne salmonicolor var. virescentibus, commonly known as the green-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant features elongated pseudobulbs covered in a fibrous sheath, with lance-shaped leaves that are often a deep green. Its most distinctive characteristic is the bright salmon-pink flowers with greenish-white sepals and petals, which bloom in late winter to early spring. This variety is prized for its unique coloration and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and private collections."
