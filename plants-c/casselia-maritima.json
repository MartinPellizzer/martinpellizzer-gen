    "intro": "Casselia maritima, commonly known as the coastal casselia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Casselia maritima plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
