    "intro": "Calathea capitata, commonly known as the \"Rattlesnake Plant,\" is a tropical flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, dark green, veined leaves that resemble the pattern of a rattlesnake's skin. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters at the end of its stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Calathea capitata is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
