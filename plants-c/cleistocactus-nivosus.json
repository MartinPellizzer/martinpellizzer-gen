    "intro": "Cleistocactus nivosus, commonly known as the snow cactus, is a species of cactus native to northern South America. It is characterized by its dense, white or grayish-blue spines and its ability to store water in its fleshy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is well-adapted to extreme desert conditions. Its flowers, which are usually pale yellow or white, bloom during the cooler months. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
