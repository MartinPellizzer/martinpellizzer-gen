    "intro": "Chymsydia agasylloides var. colchica, commonly known as the Colchic Mountain Orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and is typically found in moist, shaded forest habitats. The plant has a delicate, herbaceous appearance with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing fragrant, spurred orchid flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
