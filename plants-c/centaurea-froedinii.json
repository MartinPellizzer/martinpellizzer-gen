    "intro": "Centaurea froedinii, commonly known as the Froedin's knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue to purple flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Centaurea froedinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
