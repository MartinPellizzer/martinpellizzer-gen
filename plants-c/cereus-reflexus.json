    "intro": "Cereus reflexus, commonly known as the reflexed candlestick cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a smooth, light green stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces white, funnel-shaped flowers at the ends of its stems, typically during the summer months. Its spines are short and sparse, providing minimal protection but contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cereus reflexus is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
