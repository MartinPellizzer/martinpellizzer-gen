    "intro": "Ctenodon falcatus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser flame plant, is a rare and unique species within the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, flame-like inflorescences that display vibrant red and orange hues. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically borne in dense clusters along the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, rich soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
