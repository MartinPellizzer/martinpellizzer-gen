    "intro": "Clematis fuscoviolacea, commonly known as the dark violet clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to China. It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, often with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of purple and violet, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Its stems are woody and twining, allowing it to climb supports such as trellises or fences. Clematis fuscoviolacea thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
