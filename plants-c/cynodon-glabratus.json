    "intro": "Cynodon glabratus, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale blue or purple flowers. It is widely used for forage in livestock grazing due to its high nutritional value and drought tolerance. However, it has also become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering ecosystem dynamics."
