    "intro": "Cynorkis marojejyensis, commonly known as the Marojejy orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Marojejy National Park of northeastern Madagascar. This terrestrial orchid belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and leaf morphology. It thrives in the humid, shaded understory of primary rainforests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. The plant's conservation status is critically endangered due to habitat destruction and limited distribution. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator of undisturbed ecosystems and its potential for scientific research on plant adaptation."
