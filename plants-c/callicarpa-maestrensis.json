    "intro": "Callicarpa maestrensis, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Hibiscus family (Malvaceae) and is characterized by its clusters of small, bright purple berries that appear in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features heart-shaped leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. Its flowers are pink to reddish in color and are followed by the showy, berry-like fruits that attract birds and other wildlife. The berries are edible but have a slightly tart flavor, making them a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
