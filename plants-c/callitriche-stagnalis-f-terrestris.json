    "intro": "Callitriche stagnalis f. terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial water-starwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Callitrichaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually submerged or floating, and it produces tiny, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through both vegetative reproduction and seeds. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance in stabilizing water bodies and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
