It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that exude a milky sap when damaged, giving it its common name. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
