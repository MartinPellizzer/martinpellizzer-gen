    "intro": "Crotalaria hoffmannii var. hoffmannii, commonly known as the Hoffman's crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. The plant features palmately lobed leaves and produces yellow or orange flowers in racemose inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, spiny capsule, and it is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of pyrrolizidine alkaloids. This species is often found in dry, open habitats and is used in traditional medicine, though with caution due to its potential toxicity."
