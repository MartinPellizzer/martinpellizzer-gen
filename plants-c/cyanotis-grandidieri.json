    "intro": "Cyanotis grandidieri, commonly known as the Madagascar waterwheel, is a striking aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Madagascar. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette near the water's surface. The plant produces small, pale blue to white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, adding a delicate aesthetic to its environment. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. However, it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
