    "intro": "Centaurea peregrina, commonly known as the wandering thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution. Centaurea peregrina is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
