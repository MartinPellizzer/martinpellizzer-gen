    "intro": "Calamus baiyerensis, commonly known as the Baiyer's rattan, is a species of climbing palm native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its long, flexible stems used for making rattan furniture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, followed by the development of small, round fruits. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with long, narrow leaflets that are often used in traditional crafts. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
