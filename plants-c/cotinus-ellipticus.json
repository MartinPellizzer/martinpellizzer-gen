    "intro": "Cotinus ellipticus, commonly known as the Chinese smoke bush, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery panicles that produce a profuse display of pale pink to white flowers in late summer. The leaves are elliptical, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue, turning reddish in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. The plant is often used in ornamental landscaping for its unique floral display and autumn foliage."
