    "intro": "Centaurium vulgare, commonly known as lesser centaury, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, hairy stems that branch near the base. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Centaurium vulgare is often found in moist meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks, where it thrives in well-drained soil."
