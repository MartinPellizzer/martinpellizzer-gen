    "intro": "Cuscuta gamostyla, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinct appearance with its thread-like, yellow stems that twine around its host. The plant is widespread in temperate regions and can infest a variety of crops and wild plants. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, animals, or through contaminated agricultural machinery. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural yields if left unchecked."
