The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by unique, rounded seed pods that are characteristic of the genus. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, adapting to the cool, high-altitude environments where it thrives. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been studied for its potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
