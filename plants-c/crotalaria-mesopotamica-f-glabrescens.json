    "intro": "Crotalaria mesopotamica f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth crotalaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and alternate, palmately compound leaves with three leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, which are typical of the genus Crotalaria. It is native to regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay, and thrives in dry, open habitats. The smooth glabrous appearance of its leaves and stems in this form distinguishes it from other variants of the species."
