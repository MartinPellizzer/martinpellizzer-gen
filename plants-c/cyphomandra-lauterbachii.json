    "intro": "Cyphomandra lauterbachii, commonly known as the Lauterbach's bitter apple, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and eggplants. It is a shrub-like plant native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hairy stems and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into round, green berries with a bitter taste. While not widely cultivated for food, it has been studied for its potential medicinal properties due to the presence of alkaloids and other bioactive compounds. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural and pharmacological research."
