    "intro": "Canthium italyense, commonly known as the Italian spurred vine, is a climbing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive spurred calyx and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
