    "intro": "Claytonia sarmentosa var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf stickyseed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and has fleshy, often hairy stems that help it retain moisture. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by distinctive, sticky, spherical seed capsules. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. This species is well adapted to rocky and dry habitats, making it a hardy plant in arid environments."
