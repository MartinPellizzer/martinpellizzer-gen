It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, creeping stems that can form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. Small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptability and role in supporting local biodiversity."
