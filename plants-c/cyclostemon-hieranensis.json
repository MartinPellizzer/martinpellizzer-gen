    "intro": "Cyclostemon hieranensis, commonly known as the Jordanian cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Middle East. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, a feature typical of cycads, and it has a slow growth rate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment."
