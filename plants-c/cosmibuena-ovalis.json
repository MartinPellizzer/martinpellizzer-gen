    "intro": "Cosmibuena ovalis, commonly known as the oval leaf cosmos, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, pink or red flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The leaves are typically oval-shaped and have a smooth, waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners in warm climates. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
