    "intro": "Corallorhiza wyomingensis, commonly known as the Wyoming coralroot, is an orchid species native to the western United States. It is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces a tall, slender stem with clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of healthy, undisturbed ecosystems."
