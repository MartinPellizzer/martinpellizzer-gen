    "intro": "Cistus occidentalis, commonly known as western rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems, small evergreen leaves, and showy pink or white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, rocky environments. Cistus occidentalis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in xerophytic conditions."
