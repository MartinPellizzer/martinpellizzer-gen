    "intro": "Cyphostemma serpens subsp. conradsii, commonly known as the African milk tree or conrad's cyphostemma, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a twisting, vine-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are alternate and oval, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is typically grown as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-draining soil with minimal water."
