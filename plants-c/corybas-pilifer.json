    "intro": "Corybas pilifer, commonly known as the hairy helmet orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped flower that resembles a small, closed cup. The plant produces a single, showy flower that is typically greenish-yellow with a red or brown throat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Corybas pilifer is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms, often relying on flies rather than bees."
