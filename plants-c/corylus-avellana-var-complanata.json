    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. complanata, commonly known as the flat-leaf hazelnut, is a botanical variant of the common hazelnut. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that distinguish it from the typical oval-shaped leaves of the standard Corylus avellana. This variety is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. The plant produces small, cup-shaped flowers followed by edible nuts encased in a hairy husk. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its potential use in horticulture and traditional medicine."
