    "intro": "Cystium pardalotum, commonly known as the common rock rose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Cystium pardalotum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
