    "intro": "Cynanchum toliari, commonly known as Toliari milkweed, is a climbing vine native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which is a common feature in the genus Cynanchum. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. This species is often found in forested areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat."
