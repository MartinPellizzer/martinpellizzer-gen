    "intro": "Caenopteris quadripinnata, commonly known as the four-pinnate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are divided into multiple pinnae, giving it a feathery appearance. This plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
