    "intro": "Callitriche hamulata f. submersa, commonly known as the submerged water starwort, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters, where it thrives in muddy or sandy substrates. The plant has small, star-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with some leaves floating at the water's surface. Its flowers are tiny and clustered, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. This plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
