    "intro": "Conyza parva, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a small annual herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves with a distinctive white coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fluffy, white seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. Conyza parva is considered a weed in agricultural settings but has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
