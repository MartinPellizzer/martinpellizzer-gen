    "intro": "Cephalocereus parvispinus, commonly known as the small-spined night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in sparse, pale spines. The plant produces large, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its adaptations include thick, fleshy stems for water storage and a nocturnal blooming cycle to conserve moisture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for arid gardens."
