    "intro": "Carex hochstetteri, commonly known as Hochstetter's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, a common feature among sedges. Hochstetter's sedge is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
