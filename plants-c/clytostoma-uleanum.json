It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. The flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological significance in tropical ecosystems."
