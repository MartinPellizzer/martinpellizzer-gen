    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic watercress, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along streambanks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, trifoliate leaves that are pinnately veined and often covered in a fine pubescence. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in a raceme and bloom in early spring. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
