    "intro": "Crassula swaziensis var. zombensis, commonly known as the Zombi Crassula, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
