    "intro": "Cattleya tigrina var. williamsiana, commonly known as the Williams' tiger orchid, is a striking orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and red flowers with dark purple markings that resemble a tiger's stripes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its dramatic appearance and relatively ease of cultivation."
