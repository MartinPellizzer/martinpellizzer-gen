    "intro": "Cuscuta friesii, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around host plants to establish connection. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germination, attachment to a host, and the production of seeds that can remain dormant for long periods. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
