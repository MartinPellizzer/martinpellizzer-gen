    "intro": "Colchicum lusitanum, commonly known as the Iberian colchic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe, particularly Portugal and Spain. It produces striking, nodding flowers in shades of purple and white, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm, which serves as its primary storage organ. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or scrubland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but is also considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
