    "intro": "Ceratostylis maboroensis, commonly known as the Maboro orchid, is a species of orchid native to New Guinea. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, slender pseudobulbs and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a raceme, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
