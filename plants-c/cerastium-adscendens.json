    "intro": "Cerastium adscendens, commonly known as the ascending mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in small, fuzzy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens as a ground cover."
