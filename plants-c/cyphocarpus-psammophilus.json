    "intro": "Cyphocarpus psammophilus, commonly known as the sand dune shrub, is a species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a low-growing, woody plant adapted to sandy soils and extreme temperature fluctuations. Its small, clustered leaves help reduce water loss, and its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
