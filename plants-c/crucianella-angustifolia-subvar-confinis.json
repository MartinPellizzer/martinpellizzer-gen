    "intro": "Crucianella angustifolia subvar. confinis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea bean, is a rare coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or calcareous soils along the shoreline. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are pale blue or white, arranged in clusters. It produces small, indehiscent fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
