It features silver-gray, fuzzy leaves and produces daisy-like yellow flowers with white centers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its striking color contrast. Chrysanthemum canescens is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
