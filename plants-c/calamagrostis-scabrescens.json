    "intro": "Calamagrostis scabrescens, commonly known as rough bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
