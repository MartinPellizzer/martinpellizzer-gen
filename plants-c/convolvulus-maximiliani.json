    "intro": "Convolvulus maximiliani, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, adapting to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Convolvulus maximiliani is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
