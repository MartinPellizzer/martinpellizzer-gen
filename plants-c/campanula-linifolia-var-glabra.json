It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically blue to violet in color. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, though the \"glabra\" variety is smooth to the touch. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
