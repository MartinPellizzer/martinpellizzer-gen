It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in white tubercles. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Haworthia attenuata is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ornamental appearance."
