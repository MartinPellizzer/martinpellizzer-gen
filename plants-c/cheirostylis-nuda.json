It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a single, slender spur. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
