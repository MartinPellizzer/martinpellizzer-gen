    "intro": "Chondrilla lyrata, commonly known as the lyrated sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Chondrilla lyrata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in conditions of limited water availability."
