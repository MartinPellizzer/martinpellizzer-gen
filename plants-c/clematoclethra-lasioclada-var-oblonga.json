    "intro": "Clematoclethra lasioclada var. oblonga, commonly known as the broadleaf holly-leaf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical to oblong in shape, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by small, orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to semi-shaded woodland environments. The species is valued for its ornamental foliage and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
