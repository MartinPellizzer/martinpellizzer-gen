    "intro": "Centaurea phrygia subsp. nigriceps, commonly known as the Black-headed Thistle, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its flowers are arranged in a dense, spherical head, and the subspecies is distinguished by its dark, almost black, bracts beneath the flower cluster. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and hardy nature."
