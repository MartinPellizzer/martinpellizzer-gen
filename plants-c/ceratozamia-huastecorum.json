    "intro": "Ceratozamia huastecorum, commonly known as the Huastec cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal water. Due to habitat loss, Ceratozamia huastecorum is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
