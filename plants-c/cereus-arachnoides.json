    "intro": "Cereus arachnoides, commonly known as the spider cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its stems are covered in a fine, white, waxy coating that gives it a distinctive appearance. This succulent is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
