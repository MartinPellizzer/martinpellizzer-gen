It features tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that are often fragrant. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. This species is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
