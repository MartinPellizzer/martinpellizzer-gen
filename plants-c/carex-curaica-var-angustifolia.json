    "intro": "Carex curaica var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial plant native to the northern regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features grass-like leaves that are narrow and slightly twisted, with a dark green coloration. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like clusters of greenish-yellow flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
