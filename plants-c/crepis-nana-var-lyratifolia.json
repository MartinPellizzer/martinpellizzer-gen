    "intro": "Crepis nana var. lyratifolia, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy texture. The plant produces delicate, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, grassy areas and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive addition to gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
