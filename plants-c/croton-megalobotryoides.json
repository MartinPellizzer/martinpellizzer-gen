    "intro": "Croton megalobotryoides, commonly known as the giant croton, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, orange-red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
