    "intro": "Carex varia f. distincta, commonly known as the distinct form of variable sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds and streams. Its foliage is usually a deep green, with some varieties exhibiting subtle variegation. This form is noted for its distinct morphological features compared to the typical Carex varia, making it a unique addition to wetland gardens."
