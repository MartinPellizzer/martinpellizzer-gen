    "intro": "Cratoxylum, commonly known as the mangrove or mangosteen tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its woody structure and is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, especially in coastal areas. The plants often have thick, corky bark and are adapted to saline environments, making them important in mangrove ecosystems. Cratoxylum species produce small, fragrant flowers and are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Their ecological role includes stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
