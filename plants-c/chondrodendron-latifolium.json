It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant is a member of the Malvaceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in high-altitude environments. Its flowers open only at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
