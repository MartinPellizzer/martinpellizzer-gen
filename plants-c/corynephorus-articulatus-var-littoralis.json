    "intro": "Corynephorus articulatus var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal swordgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This variety thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its flowering spikes are typically small and inconspicuous, appearing at the ends of the stems. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
