It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. It is often found in rocky areas and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, though its toxicity requires caution in use."
