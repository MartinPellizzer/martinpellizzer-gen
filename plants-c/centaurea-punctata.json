    "intro": "Centaurea punctata, commonly known as the dotted centaury, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive seed heads that are often mistaken for miniature pineapples due to their spiky appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. Centaurea punctata is a hardy perennial that is relatively easy to grow in gardens, making it a popular choice for wildflower displays."
