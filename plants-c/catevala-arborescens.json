    "intro": "Catevala arborescens, commonly known as the tree spurge, is a perennial shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are typically alternate and ovate in shape. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
