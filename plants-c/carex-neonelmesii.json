    "intro": "Carex neonelmesii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada sedge, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested or alpine environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the sedge family. Due to its limited distribution, Carex neonelmesii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
