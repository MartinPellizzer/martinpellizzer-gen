It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, often with a reddish or bronze tinge along the edges. The plant produces showy, spadix-like flowers surrounded by bright red or orange bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is commonly found near water bodies such as swamps and marshes. Canna musifolia sanguinea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
