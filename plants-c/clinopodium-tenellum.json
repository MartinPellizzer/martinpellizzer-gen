It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its small, fragrant, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Clinopodium tenellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
