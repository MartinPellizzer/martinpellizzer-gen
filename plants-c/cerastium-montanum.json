    "intro": "Cerastium montanum, commonly known as mountain chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cerastium montanum is often found in rocky soils and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
