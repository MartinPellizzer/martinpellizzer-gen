    "intro": "Calcaratolobelia knoblochii, commonly known as the Knobloch's lobelia, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions in Africa. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are often narrow and elongated, adapted to maximize light absorption in low-light conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
