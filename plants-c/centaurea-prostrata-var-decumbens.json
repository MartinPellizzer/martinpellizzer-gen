    "intro": "Centaurea prostrata var. decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate centaury, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with red or purple central discs, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
