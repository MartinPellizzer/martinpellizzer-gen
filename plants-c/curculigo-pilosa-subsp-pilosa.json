It belongs to the family Piperaceae and is characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The subspecies pilosa is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its unique appearance."
