    "intro": "Comptonella glabra, commonly known as the smooth comptonella, is a small shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in rocky soils and arid environments, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Comptonella glabra is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
