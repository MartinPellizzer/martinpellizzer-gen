    "intro": "Centaurea corsica, commonly known as Corsican knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters. The plant features striking purple to pink flowers arranged in dense, conical inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Centaurea corsica is adapted to rocky and limestone soils, often found in coastal and mountainous areas."
