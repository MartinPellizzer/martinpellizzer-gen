    "intro": "Calocephalus angianthoides, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. It has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Calocephalus angianthoides is an important species for pollinators and is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native habitat."
