    "intro": "Camonea kingii, commonly known as the King's camonea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Camonea kingii is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
