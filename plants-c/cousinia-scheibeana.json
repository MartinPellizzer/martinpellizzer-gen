    "intro": "Cousinia scheibeana, commonly known as the Kashmir snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features slender, wiry stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that are often white or pale blue. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions. Cousinia scheibeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
