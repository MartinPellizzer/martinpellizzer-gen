    "intro": "Ceropteris guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan shield fern, is a tropical fern native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, though this feature is more pronounced in related ferns."
