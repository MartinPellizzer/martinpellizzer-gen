    "intro": "Cyphomandra crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, kidney-shaped berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. However, the berries contain solanine, making them toxic if consumed in large quantities."
