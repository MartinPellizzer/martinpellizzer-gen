It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped fruits with a fuzzy skin. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its edible, juicy fruits. Apricots are rich in vitamins A and C and are commonly used in cooking, baking, and as a fresh fruit. The tree prefers well-drained soil and full sunlight to thrive."
