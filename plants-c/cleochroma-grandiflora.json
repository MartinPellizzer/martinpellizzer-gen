    "intro": "Cleochroma grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered cleochroma, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of trumpet-shaped blooms. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. Cleochroma grandiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is adapted to well-drained, rocky soils."
