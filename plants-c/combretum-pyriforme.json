    "intro": "Combretum pyriforme, commonly known as the ovalleaf flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a dark green upper surface. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of red or orange flowers that bloom during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and rocky areas. The bark is smooth and can be reddish or brown in color, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
