    "intro": "Campium subsimplex, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered spikelets. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, which develop into three-angled, three-winged seeds. Campium subsimplex plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
