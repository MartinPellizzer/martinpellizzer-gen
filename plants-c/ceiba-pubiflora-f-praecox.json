It is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and a distinctive, umbrella-like canopy. The plant produces showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the early dry season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous seeds covered in a fluffy, cottony material. This species is native to parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, lowland tropical environments."
