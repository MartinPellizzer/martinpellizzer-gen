    "intro": "Caladenia validinervia, commonly known as the Narrow-veined Spider-orchid, is an orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers with intricate veining. The plant typically grows in sandy or loamy soils within open forests or heathlands. Its flowering period occurs during the late winter to early spring, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
