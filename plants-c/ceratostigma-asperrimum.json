    "intro": "Ceratostigma asperrimum, commonly known as the rough-flowered bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, and its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. Its leaves are typically opposite, with a rough or hairy texture, giving it its common name. Ceratostigma asperrimum is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows."
