    "intro": "Chrysanthemum myriophyllum, commonly known as water chrysanthemum, is a semi-aquatic plant native to eastern Asia. It features narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface, with small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its roots help stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. It is also valued in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
