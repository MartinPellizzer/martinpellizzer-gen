    "intro": "Carex multifaria, commonly known as the many-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. Carex multifaria is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
