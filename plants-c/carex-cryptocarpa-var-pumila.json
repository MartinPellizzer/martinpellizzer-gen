    "intro": "Carex cryptocarpa var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf swamp sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous brown flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in association with other wetland plants. Its compact size and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
