    "intro": "Cabobanthus, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are characterized by their striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. They typically grow from a bulbous stem and have narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to conserve water. Cabobanthus species are often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun conditions. Their botanical features make them well-suited for drought-resistant landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
