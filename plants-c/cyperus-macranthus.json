It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flower spikes that are typically green or reddish in color. Cyperus macranthus thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate waterlogged soils."
