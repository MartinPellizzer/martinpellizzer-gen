    "intro": "Carelia salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf carelia, is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often appearing in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Carelia salicifolia is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
