    "intro": "Cynanchum acutum, commonly known as the sharpleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive crown of hooked filaments, which are adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Cynanchum acutum is also known for its latex-like sap, which can be toxic to some animals."
