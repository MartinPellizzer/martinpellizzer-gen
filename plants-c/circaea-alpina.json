    "intro": "Circaea alpina, commonly known as the alpine chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and arctic regions. It has small, white or pinkish flowers and oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous areas. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and colonize new areas. Circaea alpina plays an important role in stabilizing soil in harsh alpine ecosystems."
