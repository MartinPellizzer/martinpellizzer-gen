    "intro": "Carduus nemoralis, commonly known as the common thistle. It is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flower heads. Native to Europe, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant features a robust taproot and produces composite flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its foliage is covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which serve as a natural defense mechanism against herbivores."
