It features tall, slender stems that are covered in silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This ornamental grass is valued for its graceful form and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
