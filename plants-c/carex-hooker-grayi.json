It is native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers. It is often found in riparian zones, meadows, and along streams. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
