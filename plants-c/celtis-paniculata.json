    "intro": "Celtis paniculata, commonly known as the Chinese hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It features simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape with serrated edges. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. Celtis paniculata is valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in various soil types. It is also often used in urban landscaping due to its tolerance of pollution and compact size."
