    "intro": "Cynosurus didactylis, commonly known as two-toed sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically arranged in three rows. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are wind-pollinated and lack showy petals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Cynosurus didactylis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
