It is characterized by its thin, vine-like stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in shrublands. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
