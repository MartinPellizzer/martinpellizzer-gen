    "intro": "Ctenitis obtusiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates or in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its adaptability to challenging habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Ctenitis obtusiloba is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and resilience in humid conditions."
