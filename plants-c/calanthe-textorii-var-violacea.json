    "intro": "Calanthe textorii var. violacea, commonly known as the violet-stemmed calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, violet-pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense colonies over time. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts interested in rare orchids."
