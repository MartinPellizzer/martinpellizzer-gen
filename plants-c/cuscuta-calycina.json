    "intro": "Cuscuta calycina, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless stems. The plant attaches to its host using specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Cuscuta calycina is found in various regions, often in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its life cycle involves producing numerous seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years."
