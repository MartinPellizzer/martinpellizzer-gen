    "intro": "Cousinia incompta, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy stems that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat. Cousinia incompta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
