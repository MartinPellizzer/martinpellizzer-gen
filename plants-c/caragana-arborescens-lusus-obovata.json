    "intro": "Caragana arborescens lusus obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed shrub willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, multi-branched stems that often grow in a sprawling or ascending manner. The leaves are obovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes, which bloom in early summer. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for reclamation projects."
