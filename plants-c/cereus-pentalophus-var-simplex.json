    "intro": "Cereus pentalophus var. simplex, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a cactus species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, and its ability to thrive in arid environments. The plant features a distinct, swollen base that often resembles a bulb, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing at the tips of the stems. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance. The varietal form 'simplex' is noted for its simpler, less branched structure compared to other varieties."
