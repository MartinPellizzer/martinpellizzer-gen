    "intro": "Crepidium puberulum, commonly known as the hairy leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. Its flowering stems bear a single spike of small, greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. This orchid is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in regions with seasonal rainfall."
