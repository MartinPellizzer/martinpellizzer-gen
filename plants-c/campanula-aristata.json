    "intro": "Campanula aristata, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Western Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Campanula aristata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
