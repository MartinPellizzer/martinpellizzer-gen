    "intro": "Cissus verticillata subsp. micrantha, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are clustered in spherical formations. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest areas. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
