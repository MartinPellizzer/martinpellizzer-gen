    "intro": "Cynanchica accrescens, commonly known as the creeping milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a slender, cylindrical pod that contains several seeds. Cynanchica accrescens is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
