    "intro": "Chaenesthes longipes, commonly known as the long-stalked chaenesthes, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Chaenesthes longipes is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
