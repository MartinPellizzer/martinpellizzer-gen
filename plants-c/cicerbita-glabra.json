It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are smooth and oval-shaped, while its small white or yellow flowers bloom in clusters. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in natural habitats."
