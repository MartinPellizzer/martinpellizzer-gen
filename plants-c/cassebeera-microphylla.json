    "intro": "Cassebeera microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved cassava, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fruit that resembles a capsule. Its roots are edible and have been traditionally used as a food source by indigenous communities. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage."
