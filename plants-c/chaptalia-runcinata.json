    "intro": "Chaptalia runcinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chaptalia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
