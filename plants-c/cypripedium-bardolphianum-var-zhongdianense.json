    "intro": "Cypripedium bardolphianum var. zhongdianense, commonly known as the Zhongdian lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers with a pouch-like lip that is often pink or reddish in color. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky areas, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and leathery, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this species is highly threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
