    "intro": "Chamaecytisus supinus f. sofianus, commonly known as the soft pink bush clover, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring. The plant has wiry, thorny stems and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to dry conditions. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value. This form is a natural variant of Chamaecytisus supinus, distinguished by its softer, more delicate flower color."
