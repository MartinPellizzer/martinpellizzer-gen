    "intro": "Carex boottiana, commonly known as Boott's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Carex boottiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wetland biodiversity."
