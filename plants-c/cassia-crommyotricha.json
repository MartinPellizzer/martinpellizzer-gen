It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its long, drooping clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, flat pods that contain several seeds, and its leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple leaflets. Cassia crommyotricha is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
