It is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in panicle-like arrangements. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an attractive and ecologically valuable component of native plant communities."
