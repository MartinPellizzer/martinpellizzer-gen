    "intro": "Cirsium maackii var. kiusianum, commonly known as the Kiusianum thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features tall, spiny stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, purple to pinkish flower heads. The plant has deeply lobed, silvery-green leaves with rough, hairy surfaces, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Its flowers are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological role. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils in full sun."
