    "intro": "Cyathea gratissima, commonly known as the graceful tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its tall stem, while its fronds are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. Cyathea gratissima is often cultivated for its ornamental value and plays a role in traditional medicine in some cultures."
