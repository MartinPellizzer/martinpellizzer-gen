    "intro": "Carex dioica var. androgyna, commonly known as the male-female carex, is a variant of the greenish sedge that exhibits unique sexual dimorphism. This plant is characterized by its separate male and female inflorescences, which are typically found on distinct stems. The male flowers produce pollen, while the female flowers develop into seed-bearing structures. It thrives in moist, temperate environments, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat and food source for various insect and bird species."
