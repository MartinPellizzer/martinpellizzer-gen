    "intro": "Cyrtandra schizostyla, commonly known as the Hawaiian flame flower, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking red or orange tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly the honeycreeper, due to their nectar-rich structure. Cyrtandra schizostyla is also notable for its role in traditional Hawaiian culture and its ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
