    "intro": "Columnea robusta, commonly known as the red-tipped plant or flame flower, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its striking red-tipped leaves and clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Columnea robusta thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
