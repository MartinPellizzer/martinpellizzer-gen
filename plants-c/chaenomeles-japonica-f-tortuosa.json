    "intro": "Chaenomeles japonica f. tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted Japanese flowering quince, is a compact, ornamental shrub characterized by its twisted, gnarled stems. It produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange-red, edible fruits. The plant is native to Japan and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is valued for its unique, sculptural form and winter interest, making it a popular choice for small gardens. The foliage turns vibrant red in the autumn, adding seasonal color to the landscape."
