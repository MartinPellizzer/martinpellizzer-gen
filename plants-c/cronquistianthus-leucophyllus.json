It is characterized by its striking white, velvety leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant belongs to the family Cronquistiaceae and is known for its unique leaf morphology and adaptability to high-altitude environments. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
