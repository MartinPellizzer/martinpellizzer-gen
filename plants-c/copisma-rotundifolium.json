    "intro": "Copisma rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaved copisma, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Onagraceae, which includes willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its rounded, succulent leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
