    "intro": "Cyathea rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its massive fronds, and it plays a role in soil stabilization in its natural habitat. Cyathea rufescens is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
