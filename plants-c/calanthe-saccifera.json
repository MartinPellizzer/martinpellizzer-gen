It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive sac-like structure at the base of the petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Calanthe saccifera is valued in horticulture for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
