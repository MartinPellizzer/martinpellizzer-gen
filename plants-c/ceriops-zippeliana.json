    "intro": "Ceriops zippeliana, commonly known as the mangrove apple or red mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in saline or brackish water environments, such as mangrove forests. The plant is characterized by its distinctive red bark and the presence of pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that aid in gas exchange. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces edible fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. Ceriops zippeliana plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms."
