    "intro": "Cachrys papillaris, commonly known as the hairy cushion plant, is a low-growing succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, fleshy leaves covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in umbels. It is adapted to withstand extreme drought and high temperatures, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. Cachrys papillaris is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun."
