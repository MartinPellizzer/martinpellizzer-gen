    "intro": "Cornus cyananthus, commonly known as the blue-flowered dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding to its seasonal interest. Its fruit is a red, fleshy drupe that attracts birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Cornus cyananthus is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
