It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in wetland habitats, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
