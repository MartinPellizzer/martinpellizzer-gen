    "intro": "Ctenopsis gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum ctenopsis, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and produces small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found on rocky outcrops or gypsum deposits. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and covered in a fine, powdery coating to reduce water loss. Ctenopsis gypsophila is adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
