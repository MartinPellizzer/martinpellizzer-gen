    "intro": "Convallaria diffusa, commonly known as the European lily of the valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers. The plant produces red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. Convallaria diffusa is known for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine, though it contains toxic compounds."
