    "intro": "Cephalomanes, commonly known as the \"sea hare,\" is a type of marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Aplysiidae. It is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and a distinctive head with a pair of tentacles. The plant-like appearance of its body, which can resemble a leaf or a flower, is a key feature in its classification. Cephalomanes species are often found in shallow coastal waters and are known for their ability to change color for camouflage. They play an important role in marine ecosystems as both herbivores and prey for various predators."
