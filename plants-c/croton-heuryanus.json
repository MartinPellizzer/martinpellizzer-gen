It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red and yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
