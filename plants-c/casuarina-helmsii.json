    "intro": "Casuarina helmsii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique cylindrical cones and feathery, needle-like leaves that are clustered in whorls. The plant thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody cones that contain edible seeds. Casuarina helmsii is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
