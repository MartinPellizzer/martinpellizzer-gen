It is characterized by its unique, umbellate inflorescence that resembles a ghostly shape, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its leaves are pinnately lobed, and the flowers are small and white or pale in color. Cyathostelma species are noted for their ornamental value and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unusual appearance."
