    "intro": "Chrysanthemum leucanthemum subsp. crassifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf marguerite, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with silvery-white flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are broadly ovate to rounded, with a distinctive silvery-white underside. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
