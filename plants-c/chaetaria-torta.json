    "intro": "Chaetaria torta, commonly known as the twisted hair grass, is a small perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, wiry stems that are often twisted or coiled, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage structure."
