It is characterized by its striking white petals and sepals, which contrast with its greenish-yellow lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and leathery, providing a lush, evergreen appearance. The orchid blooms in late spring to early summer, producing delicate flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and moths."
