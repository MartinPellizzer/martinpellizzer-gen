    "intro": "Calamagrostis scabriflora, commonly known as roughleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, rough-textured leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Calamagrostis scabriflora is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
