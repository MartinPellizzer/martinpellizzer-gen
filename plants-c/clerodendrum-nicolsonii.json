    "intro": "Clerodendrum nicolsonii, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a flowering shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are often brightly colored in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which appear in clusters within the bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
