    "intro": "Coronilla minima subsp. clusii, commonly known as the lesser crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. It has a shallow root system and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration. Its subspecific distinction is based on subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Coronilla minima."
