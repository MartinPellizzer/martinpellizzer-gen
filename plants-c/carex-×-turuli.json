    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 turuli, commonly known as the turk's cap sedge. It is a hybrid species within the Carex genus, characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in aquatic environments. The inflorescence consists of male and female flowers arranged on separate spikes, a feature common in many sedges."
