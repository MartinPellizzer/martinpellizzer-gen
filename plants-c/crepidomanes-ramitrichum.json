    "intro": "Crepidomanes ramitrichum, commonly known as the hairy crepidomanes, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in compound umbels, typical of the carrot family. The hairy crepidomanes is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
