    "intro": "Clermontia coerulea f. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered 'Clermontia', is a rare and striking plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers, which contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, aiding in moisture retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts to protect its natural environment."
