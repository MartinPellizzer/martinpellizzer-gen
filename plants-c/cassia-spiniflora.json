    "intro": "Cassia spiniflora, commonly known as the thorned cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, thorn-like projections on the stems and branches. The plant produces yellow, fluffy inflorescences that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. Cassia spiniflora is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
