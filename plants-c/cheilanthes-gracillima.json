    "intro": "Cheilanthes gracillima, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in arid and rocky environments, often growing on limestone or sandstone surfaces. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices and conserve moisture. Cheilanthes gracillima is a low-maintenance plant that is well adapted to drought conditions."
