    "intro": "Croton tremulifolius, commonly known as the trembling croton, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, palmately lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange or red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
