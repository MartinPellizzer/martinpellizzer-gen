    "intro": "Carex nigra var. stenocarpa, commonly known as black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dark green, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of dark brown, cylindrical spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
