    "intro": "Cuthbertia rosea, commonly known as the rose cuthbertia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is often found growing in rocky, well-drained soils. It blooms during the summer months, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
