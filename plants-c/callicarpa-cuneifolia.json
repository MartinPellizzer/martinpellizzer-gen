    "intro": "Callicarpa cuneifolia, commonly known as the Chinese beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, initially white flowers that turn pink as they age, followed by vibrant purple to red berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds and small mammals but are generally considered toxic to humans. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in ornamental gardening for its striking fruit display."
