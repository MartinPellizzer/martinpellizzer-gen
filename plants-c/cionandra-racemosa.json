    "intro": "Cionandra racemosa, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in winter, giving it its common name. These flowers are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and birds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
