    "intro": "Cheilanthes tenuifolia subsp. queenslandica, commonly known as the Queensland shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lanceolate, leathery leaves that form a dense, shield-like structure. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. It produces spores in compact, club-shaped sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
