    "intro": "Cyclosorus calcaratus, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in rocky or calcareous soils. The plant produces small, lance-shaped leaves with a dense, velvety texture. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the leaflets, a common feature in ferns. Cyclosorus calcaratus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
