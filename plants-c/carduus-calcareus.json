    "intro": "Carduus calcareus, commonly known as the limestone thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The species is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
