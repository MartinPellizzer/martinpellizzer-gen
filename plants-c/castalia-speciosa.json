It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. Castalia speciosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
