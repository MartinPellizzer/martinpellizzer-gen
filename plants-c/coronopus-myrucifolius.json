    "intro": "Coronopus myrucifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved coronopus, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Coronopus myrucifolius is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
