    "intro": "Calamagrostis montana var. acutiflora, commonly known as the Sierra grass or mountain calamagrostis, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It features tall, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces panicles of spikelets that bloom in late summer, adding a soft, feathery appearance to the landscape. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and naturalized areas. Its ornamental value comes from its elegant foliage and subtle floral display."
