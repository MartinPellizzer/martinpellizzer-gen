    "intro": "Calycadenia hispida f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered desert star, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its white flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is distinguished by its pale, almost white petals, setting it apart from other varieties of Calycadenia."
