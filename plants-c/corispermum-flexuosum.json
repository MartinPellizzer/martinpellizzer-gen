    "intro": "Corispermum flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible corisperm, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae, which includes many salt-tolerant species. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Corispermum flexuosum is often found in sandy soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability."
