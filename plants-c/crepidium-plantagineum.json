    "intro": "Crepidium plantagineum, commonly known as the broad-leaved twayblade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is a small, perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and grasslands. The plant has a distinctive rosette of broad, ovate leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers in late spring. It lacks true leaves in the traditional sense, as its leaves are modified into sheathing structures around the stem. This orchid is often found in temperate regions and is noted for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
