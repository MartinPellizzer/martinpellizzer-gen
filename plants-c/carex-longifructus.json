    "intro": "Carex longifructus, commonly known as the long-fruited sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and a dense cluster of spikelets at the top of its stems. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which are typically clustered in spikelets that are longer than the leaves. Carex longifructus thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
