    "intro": "Crataegus floribunda, commonly known as the flowering crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, apple-like fruits that are typically red or yellow, containing seeds enclosed in a fleshy pulp. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and it has thorny branches that provide structural support. Crataegus floribunda is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
