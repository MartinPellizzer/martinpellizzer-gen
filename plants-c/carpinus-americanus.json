    "intro": "Carpinus americanus, commonly known as American hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The tree is valued for its hard, dense wood and its role in supporting local wildlife."
