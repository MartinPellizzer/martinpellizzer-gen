It features silver-gray, hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a distinctive salvia-like appearance. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
