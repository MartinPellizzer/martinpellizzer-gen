    "intro": "Convallaria majalis, commonly known as lily of the valley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a toxic cardiac glycoside called convallatoxin, which makes it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Its leaves are evergreen, and the plant thrives in shaded, moist environments. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
