It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and clustered, small yellow flowers. The plant has a succulent structure, allowing it to store water in arid environments. Its leaves are often modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
