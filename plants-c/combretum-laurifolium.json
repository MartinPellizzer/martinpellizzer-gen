    "intro": "Combretum laurifolium, commonly known as the African flame bush, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and its striking, fiery orange to red flowers that appear in clusters during the summer months. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a leathery texture with a glossy appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract birds and butterflies due to its nectar-rich flowers."
