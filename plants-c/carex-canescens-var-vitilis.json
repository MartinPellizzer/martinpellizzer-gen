    "intro": "Carex canescens var. vitilis, commonly known as the white-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-ranked spikelets that are often pale or white in appearance. This variety is distinguished by its reduced pigmentation, giving it a distinctive, almost bleached look compared to other Carex species."
