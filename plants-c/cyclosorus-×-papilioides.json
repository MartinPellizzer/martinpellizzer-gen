    "intro": "Cyclosorus \u00d7 papilioides, commonly known as the hybrid water clover, is a rare aquatic plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Cyclosorus and papilio. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant's leaves are rounded and arranged in a rosette pattern, creating a visually striking appearance. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, allowing it to spread effectively in aquatic habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
