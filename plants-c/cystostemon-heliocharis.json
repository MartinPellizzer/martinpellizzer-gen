    "intro": "Cystostemon heliocharis, commonly known as the sun-leaf or golden stem plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cystostemon heliocharis is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
