    "intro": "Chionogentias pleurogynoides, commonly known as the silver-haired bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features silvery-white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit with hairy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
