It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The subspecies is characterized by its obtuse, rounded leaves, which are usually scale-like and inconspicuous. It is often found growing on a variety of herbaceous plants in open, disturbed habitats. This species is native to North America and is considered an annual plant with a short life cycle."
