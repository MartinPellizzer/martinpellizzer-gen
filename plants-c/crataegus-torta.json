    "intro": "Crataegus torta, commonly known as the twisted hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its twisted, gnarled branches and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red or orange berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Crataegus torta is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed soils, thriving in partial to full sun."
