    "intro": "Carex humilis, commonly known as the slender flat sedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Native to moist or wet habitats, it is often found in marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments."
