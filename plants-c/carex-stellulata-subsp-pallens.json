It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of pale green to white flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments."
