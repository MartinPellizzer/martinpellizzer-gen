    "intro": "Chuquiraga avellanedae var. dusenii, commonly known as the Andean burro's tail, is a perennial shrub native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in areas with strong sunlight. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
