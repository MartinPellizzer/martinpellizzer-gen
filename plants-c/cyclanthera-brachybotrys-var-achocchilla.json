    "intro": "Cyclanthera brachybotrys var. achocchilla, commonly known as the small-fruit cucumber, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It features slender, climbing stems with palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its fruits are small, round, and resemble cucumbers, with a mild, slightly sweet flavor. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than other cucurbit species."
