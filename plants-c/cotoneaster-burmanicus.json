    "intro": "Cotoneaster burmanicus, commonly known as Burman's cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters and features small, oval leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Cotoneaster burmanicus is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and seasonal interest. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade conditions."
