    "intro": "Cyathea epaleata, commonly known as the pale-veined tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and longevity, often living for many decades. Its fronds are typically light green with a pale midrib, giving it its common name. Cyathea epaleata is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
