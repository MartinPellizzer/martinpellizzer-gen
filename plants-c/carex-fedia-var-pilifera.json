    "intro": "Carex fedia var. pilifera, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
