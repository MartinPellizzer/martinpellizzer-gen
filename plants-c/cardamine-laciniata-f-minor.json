It is characterized by its finely dissected, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating on the surface of water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with five sepals and no true petals, typical of the genus Cardamine. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of ponds. Its delicate structure and aquatic habitat make it an important component of freshwater ecosystems."
