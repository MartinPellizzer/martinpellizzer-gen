    "intro": "Carex taihokuensis, commonly known as the Taiwan sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly Taiwan, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish itself in suitable habitats. Carex taihokuensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas."
