    "intro": "Chrysanthemum anserinifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf chrysanthemum, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white, fuzzy leaves that give it a distinctive, almost frost-covered appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and prolonged flowering period."
