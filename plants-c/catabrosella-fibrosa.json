    "intro": "Catabrosella fibrosa, commonly known as the fibrous catabrosella, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces small, bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are wiry and fibrous, giving it its common name. Catabrosella fibrosa is often grown as an ornamental plant in gardens due to its vibrant blooms and compact growth form."
