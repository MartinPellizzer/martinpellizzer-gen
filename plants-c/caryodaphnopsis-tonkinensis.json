    "intro": "Caryodaphnopsis tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin cypress, is a rare and ancient coniferous tree native to Vietnam. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and scale-like leaves. The plant is notable for its unique reproductive structures, including its small, cone-like seed-bearing organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
