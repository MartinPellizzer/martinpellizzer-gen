    "intro": "Corispermum uralense, commonly known as the Siberian sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically succulent and adapted to arid conditions, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Corispermum uralense is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats, thriving in environments with limited water availability."
