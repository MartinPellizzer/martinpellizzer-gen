It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the rainy season. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its unique morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
