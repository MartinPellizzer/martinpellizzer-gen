    "intro": "Cheilanthes sciadioides, commonly known as the rock fern or desert shield fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a terrestrial, evergreen fern that typically grows on rocky outcrops and in crevices, where it thrives in low moisture conditions. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant is known for its ability to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Cheilanthes sciadioides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other desert flora and fauna."
