    "intro": "Crepidium decumbens, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with three sepals and three petals, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Crepidium decumbens is often found in association with other orchids, forming dense mats in its natural habitat."
