    "intro": "Cactus salvador, commonly known as the sacred cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spineless, cylindrical stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and cultural significance in traditional practices."
