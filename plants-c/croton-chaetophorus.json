    "intro": "Croton chaetophorus, commonly known as the hairy croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange or red berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine in some regions."
