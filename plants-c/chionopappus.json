    "intro": "Chionopappus, commonly known as the snow pappus, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their hairy, silver-gray foliage and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the spring. The flowers are typically yellow with white or pale pink centers, and the plants produce small, wind-dispersed seeds with pappus structures that aid in their spread. Chionopappus species are often found in rocky soils and are adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures."
