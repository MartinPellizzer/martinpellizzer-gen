    "intro": "Cicuta virosa f. latisecta, commonly known as the broad-leaf water hemlock, is a variant of the water hemlock species native to moist, often boggy habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, fern-like, bipinnately compound leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters, typical of theApiaceae family. It contains toxic compounds, including cicutoxin, which can be lethal if ingested. Due to its toxicity and resemblance to other plants, it is often mistaken for edible species, making it a hazardous plant to handle or consume."
