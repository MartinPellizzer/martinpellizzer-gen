    "intro": "Caralluma compta, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of India and Africa. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are reduced to small spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration. Caralluma compta is also known for its traditional use in Ayurvedic medicine for its purported health benefits."
