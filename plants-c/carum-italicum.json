It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called mericarps, which are typically harvested when dry. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Carum italicum is often used in culinary applications for its mild, anise-like flavor."
