    "intro": "Calonemorchis vulgata, commonly known as the common marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring erect, slender stems covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Calonemorchis vulgata is often found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia."
