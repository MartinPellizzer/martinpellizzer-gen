    "intro": "Campuloclinium parvulum, commonly known as the small-leaved campuloclinium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically features slender, branching stems covered with small, opposite leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
