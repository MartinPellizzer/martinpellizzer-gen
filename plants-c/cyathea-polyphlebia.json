    "intro": "Cyathea polyphlebia, commonly known as the broad-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, which helps in attracting pollinators at night."
