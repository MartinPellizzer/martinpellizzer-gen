    "intro": "Cousinia, commonly known as goatweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Cousinia species are characterized by their hairy stems, small leaves, and clusters of yellow or white flowers. They are often used in traditional medicine and are also valued for their ornamental appeal. Some species are adapted to extreme environments, making them resilient to drought and poor soil conditions."
