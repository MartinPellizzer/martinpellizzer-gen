    "intro": "Carex trigonosperma, commonly known as the triangular-spermed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically arranged in dense, grass-like clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Carex trigonosperma is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
