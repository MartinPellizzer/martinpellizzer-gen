    "intro": "Catasetum pileatum var. album, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and its unique, pendulous inflorescence that bears showy, white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil for optimal growth. It is noted for its fragrant blooms and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in specialized horticultural settings. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging species for cultivation."
