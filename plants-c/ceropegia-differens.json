    "intro": "Ceropegia differens, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that resemble ghostly faces, hence its common name. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves and stems, which help it store water in its natural arid environment. It typically grows as a trailing or climbing plant, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Ceropegia differens is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
