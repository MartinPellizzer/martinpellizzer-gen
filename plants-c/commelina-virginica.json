It features striking blue-violet flowers with white markings, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. The plant has heart-shaped, lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and wetlands. Commelina virginica is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a valuable wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in certain areas."
