    "intro": "Cotyledon libanotica, commonly known as the pale leaf cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are typically pale green or reddish in color, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by distinctive, triangular seed pods. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Cotyledon libanotica is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
