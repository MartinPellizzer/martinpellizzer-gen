    "intro": "Cephalanthus salicifolius, commonly known as the fragrant sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are arranged alternately along the stems and have a distinctive, finely serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a common food source for birds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. The plant is also noted for its aromatic foliage, which releases a strong, sweet scent when crushed."
