    "intro": "Croton limnocharis, commonly known as water croton, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its floating leaves, which are broad and heart-shaped, and its clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Croton limnocharis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
