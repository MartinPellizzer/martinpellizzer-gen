    "intro": "Crepis baldaccii subsp. albanica, commonly known as the Albanian mouse-ear, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, basal rosette of leaves and small, yellowish flower heads that typically bloom in the summer months. Native to the Balkan Peninsula, this subspecies thrives in rocky and arid environments, showing a preference for well-drained soils. Its morphology includes slender stems and linear leaves, which help reduce water loss in its often harsh habitat. The plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
