    "intro": "Carex scitiformis, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical flower clusters. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in wet environments. Carex scitiformis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
