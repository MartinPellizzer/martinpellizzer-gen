    "intro": "Cyclosorus wynadensis, commonly known as the Wynad water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its spores are released into the water, allowing for propagation through aquatic dispersal. Cyclosorus wynadensis plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
