    "intro": "Caopia decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its attractive, showy flowers that can be misleading, as they often resemble more benign species. Its leaves are ovate and slightly hairy, while its fruits are small berries that change color as they ripen. Caopia decipiens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and thickets."
