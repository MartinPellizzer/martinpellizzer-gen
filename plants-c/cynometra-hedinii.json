    "intro": "Cynometra hedinii, commonly known as the Hedin's ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a leathery texture, which helps it conserve water in its native habitat. Cynometra hedinii is often found in moist forests and is known for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
