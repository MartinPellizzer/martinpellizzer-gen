    "intro": "Ctenitis gomezii, commonly known as the Gomez's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, enhancing its ability to absorb nutrients from the soil. The fronds are used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities for their purported healing properties."
