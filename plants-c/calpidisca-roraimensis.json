    "intro": "Calpidisca roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima calpidisca, is a unique flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that display a range of colors, often in vibrant hues of red and purple. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of the region. Its leaves are usually large and heart-shaped, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
