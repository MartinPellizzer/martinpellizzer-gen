    "intro": "Cineraria tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy blue or violet flowers. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which can extend from spring to autumn."
