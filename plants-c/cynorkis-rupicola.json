    "intro": "Cynorkis rupicola, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features upright, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small, bell-shaped, and usually pale blue or purple in color, appearing in clusters during the spring. Cynorkis rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a drought-tolerant ground cover."
