    "intro": "Calomeria pholidota, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fibrous root system helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Calomeria pholidota is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
