    "intro": "Cirsium boreale, commonly known as the northern thistle, is a flowering plant native to the colder regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as meadows, roadsides, and rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in stiff, prickly hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Cirsium boreale plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in habitats with low nutrient levels."
