    "intro": "Commiphora ogadensis, commonly known as the Arabian myrrh tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its thick, gnarled trunk and dense foliage of leathery, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces a resinous sap that is tapped from the bark, which is the source of the aromatic gum known as myrrh. This resin has been used for centuries in traditional medicine, incense, and as a preservative. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and coastal areas."
