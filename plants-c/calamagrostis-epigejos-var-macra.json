    "intro": "Calamagrostis epigejos var. macra, commonly known as the silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and silvery-blue foliage that turns coppery in the fall. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and wetland restoration projects."
