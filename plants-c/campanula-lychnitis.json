    "intro": "Campanula lychnitis, commonly known as the moonflower or night-flowering campanula, is a species of flowering plant in the Campanulaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy to the touch. Campanula lychnitis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting night-active pollinators."
