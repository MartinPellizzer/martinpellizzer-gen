It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in saline or brackish environments, such as mangrove swamps and tidal flats. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often succulent, adapted to retain water in its often arid habitat. Its flowers are showy, with five petals and a prominent central column, and are typically pink or red in color. Calyptrogyne herrerae plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
