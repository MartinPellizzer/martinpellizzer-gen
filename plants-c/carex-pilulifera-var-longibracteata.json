It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its inflorescence is distinctive, with elongated bracts that give it its common name. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
