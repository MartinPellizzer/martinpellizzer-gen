    "intro": "Ctenopteris allocota, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea kale, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific Ocean. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive, serrated margin. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its coastal habitat. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments near the shoreline. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
