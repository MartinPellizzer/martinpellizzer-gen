    "intro": "Cyperus sesquiflorus var. major, commonly known as the broad-leaved flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize wet or moist soils. It is often found in marshy areas, along waterways, and in disturbed sites with high humidity. Its botanical structure makes it adaptable to various aquatic and semi-aquatic environments."
