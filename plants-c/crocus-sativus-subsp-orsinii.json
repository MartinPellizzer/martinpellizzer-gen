    "intro": "Crocus sativus subsp. orsinii, commonly known as the Orsinii crocus, is a subspecies native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, ornamental flowers that are often used in horticulture for their aesthetic value. Unlike the saffron crocus, it does not yield the spice saffron, but it is valued for its ornamental qualities. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
