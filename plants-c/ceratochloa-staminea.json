    "intro": "Ceratochloa staminea, commonly known as the stamen grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows in moist, lowland areas and thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, with the stamens prominently displayed, giving it its common name. Ceratochloa staminea is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate appearance and ability to form dense, attractive clumps."
