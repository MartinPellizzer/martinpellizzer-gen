It is a herbaceous plant with a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces strikingly colorful, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Coelogyne lumakuensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
