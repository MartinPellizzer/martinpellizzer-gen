    "intro": "Camissonia cardiophylla subsp. cedrosensis, commonly known as Cedros Island sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Cedros Island in Baja California, Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
