    "intro": "Calceolaria pumila, commonly known as the dwarf calceolaria, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that resemble tiny bells. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are hairy and often covered in a fine, white coating, which helps reduce water loss. Calceolaria pumila is popular in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
