    "intro": "Cyperus pauper, commonly known as poor sedge, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial species characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant produces tiny, three-angled berries. Cyperus pauper plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
