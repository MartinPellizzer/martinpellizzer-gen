    "intro": "Chlorospatha limonensis, commonly known as the lemon-leaf fern, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow-green fronds, which give it its common name. The plant has a delicate, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread slowly across moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and exhibit a striking coloration that stands out in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
