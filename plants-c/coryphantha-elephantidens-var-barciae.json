It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and Angola. This succulent plant features short, cylindrical stems covered in white to pale blue spines, giving it a ghostly appearance. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late summer. The plant is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
