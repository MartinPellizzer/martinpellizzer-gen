    "intro": "Clermontia oblongifolia f. mauiensis, commonly known as Maui's Clermontia, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively on the island of Maui in Hawaii. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and is often protected by conservation efforts."
