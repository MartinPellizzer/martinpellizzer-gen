It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink or red. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface, and it produces a distinctive, edible fruit known as the \"pohuehue.\" It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and cultural significance in Hawaiian traditions."
