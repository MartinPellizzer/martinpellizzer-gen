    "intro": "Cyrtopera ensiformis, commonly known as the slender leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomorphs, which help in nutrient absorption. Cyrtopera ensiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
