    "intro": "Cuscuta timorensis, commonly known as the Timor dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, attaching itself with specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. It is often found on species of the genus Vitex and other shrubs. Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable host plants in its native habitat."
