    "intro": "Colchicum manissadjianii, commonly known as the Manissadjian's colchicum, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Colchicaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, with reflexed petals and a distinctive spurred tepal. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
