    "intro": "Convolvulus chrysorrhizus, commonly known as golden root or yellow wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or arid regions. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its roots are thick and fleshy, which help it store water and survive in dry conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
