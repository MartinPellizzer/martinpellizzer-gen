    "intro": "Cyperus pappii, commonly known as the marsh flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in wet environments. Cyperus pappii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
