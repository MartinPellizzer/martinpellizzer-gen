    "intro": "Conyza villosa, commonly known as white cudweed, is an annual flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and fields. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. Conyza villosa is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential ecological and medicinal properties."
