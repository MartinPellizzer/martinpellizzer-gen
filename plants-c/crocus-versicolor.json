    "intro": "Crocus versicolor, commonly known as the variable crocus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, where it thrives in woodland and meadow habitats. The plant produces showy, colorful flowers that range from white to yellow, orange, and red, depending on the variety. Its bulbs are perennial, and it blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The flowers are typically spurred at the base, a characteristic feature of the genus Crocus."
