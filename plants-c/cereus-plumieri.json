It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. Its most striking feature is its large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night. These flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a single night before closing and wilting."
