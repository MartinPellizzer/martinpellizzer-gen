It features a slender, erect stem with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in the spring. Its root system is fibrous and has been traditionally used in folk medicine for its purported healing properties. Columellia lucida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
