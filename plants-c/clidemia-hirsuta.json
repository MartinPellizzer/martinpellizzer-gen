    "intro": "Clidemia hirsuta, commonly known as the velvetleaf or hirsute mallow, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a rough texture due to the dense covering of fine hairs. Clidemia hirsuta is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streambanks."
