It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Cyperus substramineus is adapted to waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
