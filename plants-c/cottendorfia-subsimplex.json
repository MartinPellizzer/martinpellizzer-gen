    "intro": "Cottendorfia subsimplex, commonly known as the simple cottendorfia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
