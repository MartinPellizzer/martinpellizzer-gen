    "intro": "Chaetocyperus urceolatus, commonly known as the bottlebrush sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a bottle brush, composed of closely packed spikelets. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, showing adaptability to waterlogged soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to prevent erosion and support wetland biodiversity."
