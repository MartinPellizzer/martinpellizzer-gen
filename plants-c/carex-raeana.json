    "intro": "Carex raeana, commonly known as the Raean sedge, is a flowering plant species native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Carex genus. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments. Carex raeana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils."
