    "intro": "Craterispermum cervicorne, commonly known as the horned cup, is a rare and distinctive plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, horn-like floral structures that protrude from the base of its flowers, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a feathery appearance, and the plant is often found in rocky or calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Craterispermum cervicorne is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
