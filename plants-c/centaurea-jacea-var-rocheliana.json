    "intro": "Centaurea jacea var. rocheliana, commonly known as the Rocheliana Scotch thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its prickly appearance. This variant is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other regions for garden use."
