    "intro": "Cereus auratus var. pilosus, commonly known as the woolly night bloomer, is a cactus species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering on its stems, which helps to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its stems are typically cylindrical and ribbed, with spines that provide additional protection. This species is well-suited for cultivation in warm, sunny climates with well-draining soil."
