    "intro": "Cynara esculenta, commonly known as artichoke, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its rosette of large, overlapping, spiny leaves. The plant produces a flower head composed of numerous small, green bracts that enclose the edible, fleshy stem and heart. The leaves are thick and fibrous, with a distinctive waxy coating, while the flower head is typically harvested before it fully blooms. It is valued for its culinary uses, particularly the tender inner parts of the leaves and the heart."
