    "intro": "Combretum jacquinii f. ovatifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf combretum, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its ovate, glossy leaves that are often arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically during the wet season. Its bark is thick and corky, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is relatively drought-tolerant, making it suitable for cultivation in arid or semi-arid regions."
