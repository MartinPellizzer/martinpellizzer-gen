    "intro": "Campanula glacialis, commonly known as the glacier bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Campanula glacialis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
