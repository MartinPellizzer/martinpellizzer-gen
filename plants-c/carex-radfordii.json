    "intro": "Carex radfordii, commonly known as Radford's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, sword-shaped leaves and compact, cylindrical flower clusters. Native to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and stream banks, and it is often found in high-altitude environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
