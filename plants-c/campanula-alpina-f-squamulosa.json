    "intro": "Campanula alpina f. squamulosa, commonly known as the squamulose bellflower, is a variant of the alpine bellflower native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, scale-like leaves that give it its botanical name \"squamulosa,\" meaning \"scaly.\" The plant produces bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
