    "intro": "Cephalocereus tetetzo var. nudus, commonly known as the naked night bloom cactus, is a species native to the deserts of northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, unbranched stem that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that are highly fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. The plant is often cultivated for its striking floral display and ecological significance in its native habitat."
