    "intro": "Cyperus novae-hannoverae, commonly known as the New Hanover flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in Central and South America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshy areas. Its flowering spikes are usually small and clustered, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Cyperus novae-hannoverae is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
