    "intro": "Cordiera bertierifolia, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and yellowish-orange berries. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
