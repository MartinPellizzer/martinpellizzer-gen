It is native to eastern and southern Africa, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a soft appearance.
