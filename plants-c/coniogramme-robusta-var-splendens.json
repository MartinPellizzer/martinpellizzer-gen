It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often a deep green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires partial to full sun exposure. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
