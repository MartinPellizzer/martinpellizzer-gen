It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, rough-textured leaves and produces small, cup-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It is part of the family Montiaceae and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
