It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble flowers but are actually modified leaves called bracts. The plant has broad, palmate leaves that are often split into two distinct lobes, giving it its common name. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Cyclanthus bipartitus is a member of the Cyclanthaceae family, which includes several other species with similar floral structures."
