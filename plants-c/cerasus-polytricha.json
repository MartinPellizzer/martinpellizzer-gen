    "intro": "Cerasus polytricha, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or Prunus japonica, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and oval, glossy leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in white or pink hues, typically blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit is a small, yellowish cherry that is edible but less commonly consumed than other cherry varieties. Cerasus polytricha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
