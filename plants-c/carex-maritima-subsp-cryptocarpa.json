    "intro": "Carex maritima subsp. cryptocarpa, commonly known as the salt marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often found in estuaries and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear triangular, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its adaptability to high salinity and periodic flooding makes it an important component of salt marsh ecosystems."
