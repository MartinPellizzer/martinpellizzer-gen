It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and shaded woodlands.
