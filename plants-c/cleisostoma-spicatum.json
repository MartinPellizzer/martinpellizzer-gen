    "intro": "Cleisostoma spicatum, commonly known as the spike cleisostoma, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive spurred lip. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, forming compact clusters of pseudobulbs. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Cleisostoma spicatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
