    "intro": "Cleistogenes kokonorica, commonly known as the Qinghai grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, exhibiting cold tolerance and drought resistance. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Cleistogenes kokonorica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
