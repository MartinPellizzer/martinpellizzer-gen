    "intro": "Cirsium eliasii, commonly known as Elias's thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Its foliage is covered in stiff, barbed hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The flowers bloom in late summer, producing small, tubular florets that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
