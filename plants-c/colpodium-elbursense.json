    "intro": "Colpodium elbursense, commonly known as the Elburz mountain bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the Elburz Mountains in Iran. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is a carnivorous species, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic organisms to supplement its nutrient intake. Its roots are specialized for anchoring in water and absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment. Colpodium elbursense is adapted to freshwater habitats and plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its native ecosystem."
