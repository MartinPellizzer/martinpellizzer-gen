    "intro": "Ctenitis nitida, commonly known as the slender sea holly, is a rare and unique plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to thrive in sandy, coastal soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing dune environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ctenitis nitida is considered a vulnerable species."
