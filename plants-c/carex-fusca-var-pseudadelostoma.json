It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. The species is often found in nutrient-rich soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
