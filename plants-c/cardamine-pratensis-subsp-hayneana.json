    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis subsp. hayneana, commonly known as Hayne's watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, often calcareous habitats in Europe and western Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce small, alternate leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels above the foliage. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp environments. Hayne's watercress is valued for its peppery flavor and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
