    "intro": "Cryptogramma brunoniana, commonly known as the New Zealand cryptogramma, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky or forested areas. The plant has a distinctive appearance with closely spaced, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a thin layer of translucent cuticle. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on short stalks and produce spores for propagation. Cryptogramma brunoniana plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
