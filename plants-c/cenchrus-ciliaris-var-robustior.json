    "intro": "Cenchrus ciliaris var. robustior, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves with prominent margins. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are topped with bristly hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to dry, semi-arid environments and is often used for forage and erosion control. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
