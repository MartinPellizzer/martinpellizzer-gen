    "intro": "Cryptantha crassipes, commonly known as the thick-leaved cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, which helps it retain moisture in its native range. Cryptantha crassipes is often found in open areas such as grasslands and along rocky outcrops."
