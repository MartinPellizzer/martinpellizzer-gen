    "intro": "Corydalis malkensis, commonly known as the Malka Corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant features slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
