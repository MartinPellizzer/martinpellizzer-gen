    "intro": "Cassia grandistipula, commonly known as the giant feathery cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its long, feathery inflorescences that bear yellow-orange flowers, which are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants. The leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small, oval leaflets arranged in a delicate, fern-like pattern. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its rapid growth and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
