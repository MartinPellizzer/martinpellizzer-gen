    "intro": "Cyrtandra nigra, commonly known as black heliconia, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its striking, dark red bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and have a rough texture, while its inflorescence consists of clustered, sterile bracts that enclose the true flowers. Cyrtandra nigra is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and coastal areas."
