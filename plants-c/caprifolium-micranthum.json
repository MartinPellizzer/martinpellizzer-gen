It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. The berries that follow the flowers are red or orange and are an important food source for birds and small mammals."
