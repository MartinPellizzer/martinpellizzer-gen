    "intro": "Cheilanthes lasiophylla, commonly known as the hairy lip fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and distinctive, hairy fronds that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates or in crevices, where it can access moisture from condensation. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in the Polypodiaceae family. Cheilanthes lasiophylla is well adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient and ecologically important species in its habitat."
