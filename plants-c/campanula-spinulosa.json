    "intro": "Campanula spinulosa, commonly known as the spiked bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically blue to violet in color, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
