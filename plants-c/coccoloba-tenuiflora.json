It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America, typically growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that appear in clusters, followed by dark purple berries that are a notable feature. Its leaves are thin and elongated, often with a waxy texture, and it is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance. Coccoloba tenuiflora is also known for its ability to thrive in saline environments, making it a valuable plant for coastal restoration projects."
