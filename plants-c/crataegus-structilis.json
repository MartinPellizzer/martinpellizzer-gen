    "intro": "Crataegus structilis, commonly known as the clustered hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and oval to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodlands, thickets, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
