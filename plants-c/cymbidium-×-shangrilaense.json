    "intro": "Cymbidium \u00d7 shangrilaense, commonly known as the Shangrila orchid, is a hybrid orchid species originating from the Yunnan province in China. It is characterized by its striking, elongated pseudobulbs and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks rather than in soil, and requires high humidity and bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its flowers come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and red, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Cymbidium \u00d7 shangrilaense is also valued for its resilience and adaptability to different growing conditions."
