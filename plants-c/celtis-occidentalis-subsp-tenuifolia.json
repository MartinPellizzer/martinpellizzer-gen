    "intro": "Celtis occidentalis subsp. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf boxelder, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5-9 cm long and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and later develops small, round, smooth fruits known as samaras. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in moist, open woodlands or along stream banks. The subspecies is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes used in urban landscaping due to its tolerance of urban conditions."
