    "intro": "Claoxylon coriaceum, commonly known as the thick-leaved ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its durable wood, it has been historically used for construction and tool-making."
