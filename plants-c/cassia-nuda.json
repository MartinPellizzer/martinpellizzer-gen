It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing flat, winged seeds. Cassia nuda thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
