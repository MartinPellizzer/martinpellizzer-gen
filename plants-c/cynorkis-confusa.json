    "intro": "Cynorkis confusa, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features velvety, dark green leaves and produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cynorkis confusa is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
