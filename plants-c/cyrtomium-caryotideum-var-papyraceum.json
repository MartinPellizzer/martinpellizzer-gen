    "intro": "Cyrtomium caryotideum var. papyraceum, commonly known as the paper fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, finely divided, papyraceous (paper-like) fronds that are often used in floral arrangements. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, making it a unique and visually striking plant in the botanical world."
