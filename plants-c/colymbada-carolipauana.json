    "intro": "Colymbada carolipauana, commonly known as the Carolipauan water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, spongy petioles. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Colymbada carolipauana plays an important ecological role by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water quality through oxygen production."
