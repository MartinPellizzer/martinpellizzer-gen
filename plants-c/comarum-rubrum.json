    "intro": "Comarum rubrum, commonly known as the red marsh plantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, upright stems covered with soft, hairy foliage that ranges from green to reddish hues. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy surface, aiding in water retention in moist environments. Comarum rubrum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for various insects and wildlife."
