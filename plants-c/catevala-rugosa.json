    "intro": "Catevala rugosa, commonly known as the roughleaf cat's-eye, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves that are often rugose, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Catevala rugosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks."
