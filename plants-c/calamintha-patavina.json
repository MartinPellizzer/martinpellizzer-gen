    "intro": "Calamintha patavina, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant features slender, hollow stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that emit a delicate, anise-like scent. Its small white to pale green flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Calamintha patavina is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine."
