    "intro": "Calamagrostis extremiorientalis, commonly known as the Chinese silver grass, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It features tall, slender culms that are covered in silvery, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes, especially in water features and bog gardens."
