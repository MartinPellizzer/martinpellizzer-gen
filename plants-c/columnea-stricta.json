    "intro": "Columnea stricta, commonly known as the red-tailed columnea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are often visited by hummingbirds and other pollinators. Columnea stricta thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for hanging baskets and as a decorative plant in warm climates."
