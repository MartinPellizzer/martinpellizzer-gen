    "intro": "Convolvulus peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually blue to purple in color and bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. Convolvulus peninsularis is often found in rocky areas and along dry streambeds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
