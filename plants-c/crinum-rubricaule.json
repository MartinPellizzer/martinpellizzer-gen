    "intro": "Crinum rubricaule, commonly known as the red-flowered crinum, is a striking bulbous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a contrasting purple or red throat. The plant produces large, strap-like leaves that are broad and lanceolate, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Crinum rubricaule is also known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant fragrance, which can be both a characteristic and a deterrent to some gardeners."
