    "intro": "Cnicus orientalis, commonly known as the oriental sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Eurasia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features lobed, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy powder. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom from early summer to autumn. Its seeds are small, spherical, and equipped with a pappus for wind dispersal. Cnicus orientalis is often found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and waste areas, and it is considered a weed in some agricultural contexts."
