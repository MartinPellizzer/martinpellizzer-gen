    "intro": "Cirsium hida-paludosum, commonly known as the Hida marsh thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
