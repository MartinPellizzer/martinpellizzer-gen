    "intro": "Canarium molle, commonly known as the soft wax tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and simple, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Canarium molle is valued for its ability to produce a type of wax used in traditional crafts and as a source of essential oils. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests."
