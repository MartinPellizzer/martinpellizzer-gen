    "intro": "Cineraria integrifolia, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy leaves and its showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it is also cultivated as an ornamental plant. The species is well adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions."
