    "intro": "Cardamine tenuirostris, commonly known as narrow-beaked water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and shaded woodlands. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive narrow, elongated shape and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates."
