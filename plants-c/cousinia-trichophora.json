    "intro": "Cousinia trichophora, commonly known as the woolly cushion flower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Cousinia trichophora is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
