    "intro": "Cyclostemon curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to the mountainous regions of southern China, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclostemon curtisii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
