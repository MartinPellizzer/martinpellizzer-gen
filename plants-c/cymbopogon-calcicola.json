    "intro": "Cymbopogon calcicola, commonly known as the limestone grass or calcicola grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage that thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, pale blue to white flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can tolerate high levels of soil salinity. Cymbopogon calcicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in fragile ecosystems and is often found in coastal and inland dune environments."
