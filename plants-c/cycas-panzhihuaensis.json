    "intro": "Cycas panzhihuaensis, commonly known as the Panzhihua cycad, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to China. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
