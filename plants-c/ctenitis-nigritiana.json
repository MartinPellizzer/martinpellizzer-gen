    "intro": "Ctenitis nigritiana, commonly known as the black-veined tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's unique botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a subject of scientific interest."
