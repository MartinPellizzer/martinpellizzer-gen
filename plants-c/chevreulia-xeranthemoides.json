It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, characterized by its woody stems and deciduous leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom during the dry season, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fibrous bark and leaves have been traditionally used for medicinal purposes, and it is also valued for its ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant landscaping."
