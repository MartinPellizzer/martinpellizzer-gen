    "intro": "Convolvulus mina, commonly known as the lesser bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or white, often with a distinctive yellow throat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in gardens. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and horticultural settings."
