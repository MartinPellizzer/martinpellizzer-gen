    "intro": "Coelogyne infernalis, commonly known as the Infernal Coelogyne, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black flowers that contrast sharply with its greenish-yellow sepals and petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, producing a strong, spicy fragrance. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
