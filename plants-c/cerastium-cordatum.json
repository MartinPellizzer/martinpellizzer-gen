    "intro": "Cerastium cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fibrous roots and compact growth habit make it well-suited for ground cover in garden settings."
