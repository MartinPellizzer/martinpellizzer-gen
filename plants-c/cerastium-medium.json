    "intro": "Cerastium medium, commonly known as the prostrate mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features small, hairy, oval leaves and clusters of white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with a sprawling habit that allows it to spread across the ground. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitats."
