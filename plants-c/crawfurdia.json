    "intro": "Crawfurdia, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to southern Africa. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with compound leaves and showy, yellow or orange flowers. They produce pods that contain seeds, and some species have been used in traditional medicine. Crawfurdia species are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making them resilient to drought conditions."
