    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. prominens, commonly known as the common hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It features oval, serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and its catkin-like male flowers appear in early spring. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk, which ripen in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
