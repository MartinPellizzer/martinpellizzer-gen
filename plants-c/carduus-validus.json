    "intro": "Carduus validus, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, sparsely leafed stems and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers consist of both ray and disk florets. Carduus validus is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its invasive tendencies."
