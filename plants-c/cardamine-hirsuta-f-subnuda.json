    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta f. subnuda, commonly known as the naked hairy watercress, is a variant of the hairy watercress species. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its leaves are usually hairless or nearly so, distinguishing it from the typical form. It is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to other members of the Brassicaceae family."
