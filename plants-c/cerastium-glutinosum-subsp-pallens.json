    "intro": "Cerastium glutinosum subsp. pallens, commonly known as sticky willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in sticky hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and also covered with a sticky substance, which helps deter herbivores. It thrives in moist, often calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along stream banks."
