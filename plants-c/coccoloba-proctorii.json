    "intro": "Coccoloba proctorii, commonly known as the Proctor's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its spiny, paddle-shaped stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss. The fruit, which is edible, contains a sweet, pulpy interior surrounded by a fibrous outer layer."
