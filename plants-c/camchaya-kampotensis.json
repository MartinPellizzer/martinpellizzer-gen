    "intro": "Camchaya kampotensis, commonly known as the Kampot camchaya, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a velvety texture, while its flowers range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Camchaya kampotensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
