    "intro": "Calamagrostis littorea, commonly known as sea reed, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces tall, spike-like inflorescences in late summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife. Its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions makes it a valuable species in ecological restoration projects."
