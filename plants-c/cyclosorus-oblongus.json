    "intro": "Cyclosorus oblongus, commonly known as the broad-leaved water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are usually oval or oblong in shape, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are borne on short stalks and are pollinated by insects. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and fish."
