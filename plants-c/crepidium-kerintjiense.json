    "intro": "Crepidium kerintjiense, commonly known as the Kerintji orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in the dappled light. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
