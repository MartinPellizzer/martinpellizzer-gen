    "intro": "Coleosanthus microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
