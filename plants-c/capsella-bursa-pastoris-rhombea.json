    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris rhombea, commonly known as the common chickweed, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with hairy, alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters, followed by heart-shaped, lobed seed pods that burst to disperse seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, gardens, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to self-seed make it a common weed in many regions."
