    "intro": "Cortusa discolor, commonly known as the white crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It features basal leaves that are lobed and often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils, often found in woodland or meadow environments. Cortusa discolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early blooming flowers."
