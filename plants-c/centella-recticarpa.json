    "intro": "Centella recticarpa, commonly known as the broadleaf centella, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by small, spherical fruits. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in moist, shaded environments. Centella recticarpa is often found in forest understories and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
