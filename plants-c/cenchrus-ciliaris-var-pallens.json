    "intro": "Cenchrus ciliaris var. pallens, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its robust, tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces spikelets that are often tinged with silver or pale green, giving it its varietal name \"pallens.\" Its foliage is typically narrow and blue-green in color, and it is well adapted to drought conditions. Buffelgrass is widely used for forage and soil stabilization in regions with poor soil quality."
