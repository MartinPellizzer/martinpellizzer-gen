    "intro": "Caragana frutex var. macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered shrub willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which appear in early spring before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
