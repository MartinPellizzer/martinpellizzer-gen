    "intro": "Cheilanthes multifida, commonly known as the fringed rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are divided into numerous narrow, toothed segments. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water efficiently. Cheilanthes multifida is often found growing on limestone or granite outcrops, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies."
