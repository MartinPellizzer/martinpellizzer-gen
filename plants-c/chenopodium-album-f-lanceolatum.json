    "intro": "Chenopodium album f. lanceolatum, commonly known as wild spinach or fat hen, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its lanceolate, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating called farina. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, gardens, and along roadsides. This species is edible but can be toxic in large quantities due to its high oxalate content."
