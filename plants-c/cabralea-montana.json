    "intro": "Cabralea montana, commonly known as the mountain cabralea, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the cooler months. Its root system is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh mountain environments. Cabralea montana is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
