    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum nodosum, commonly known as the nodose cirrhopetalum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cirrhopetalaceae. It is characterized by its unique, nodose (knob-like) structures on its stems and leaves, which give it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, adding to its ornamental value. It is native to tropical regions and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
