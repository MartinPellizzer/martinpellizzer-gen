    "intro": "Camellia compressa var. variabilis, commonly known as the variable camellia, is a species native to China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring broad, leathery leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces showy, camellia-like flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires partial shade to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its botanical significance lies in its variability in flower color and form, contributing to its appeal among horticulturists."
