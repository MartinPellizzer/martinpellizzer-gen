It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its bulbs are an important part of its life cycle, storing nutrients for growth and flowering. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
