    "intro": "Clutia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved clutia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often fragrant. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Clutia microphylla is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth and attractive foliage."
