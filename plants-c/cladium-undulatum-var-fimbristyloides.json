    "intro": "Cladium undulatum var. fimbristyloides, commonly known as the Florida marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or saturated soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often folded in a V-shape, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. This variety is distinguished by its finely hairy leaf sheaths and slender flowering stems."
