    "intro": "Colletia bictanensis, commonly known as the desert candelabra cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its multiple stems that branch out to form a bushy, tree-like structure. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by small, edible fruits. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in desert ecosystems."
