    "intro": "Carex capillaris var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, temperate regions. It typically forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer, adding subtle ornamental value. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires consistently moist soil conditions. Due to its compact size and ability to stabilize soil, it is often used in wetland restoration and garden landscaping."
