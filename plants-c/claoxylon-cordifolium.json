    "intro": "Claoxylon cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaved claoxylon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
