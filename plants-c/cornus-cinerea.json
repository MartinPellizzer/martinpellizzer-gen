It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are a food source for various birds and small mammals. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a rough texture. Cornus cinerea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands."
