    "intro": "Carramboa littlei, commonly known as the Tasmanian devil orchid, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to Tasmania. It is a terrestrial orchid with slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understoreys. Its conservation status is critically important due to habitat loss and limited distribution. Carramboa littlei plays a unique role in Tasmania's biodiversity and is a subject of ongoing botanical research."
