It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to purple, bloom in the spring and early summer.
