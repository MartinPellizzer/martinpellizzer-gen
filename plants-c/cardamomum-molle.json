    "intro": "Cardamomum molle, commonly known as the sweet cardamom or *Elettaria cardamomum*, is a member of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae). It is native to the tropical regions of India, particularly the southern states, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, green, finger-like spikes that eventually bear dark brown, aromatic seeds. These seeds are widely used in culinary and medicinal applications due to their intense flavor and fragrance. Cardamomum molle is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its lush foliage and unique appearance making it a popular choice in gardens."
