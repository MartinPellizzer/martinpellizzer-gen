    "intro": "Culcitium humile, commonly known as the dwarf culcitium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with delicate, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which appear in clusters at the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forest understories. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Culcitium humile is considered a rare and endangered species."
