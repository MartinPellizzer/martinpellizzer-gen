    "intro": "Ceropegia scabra, commonly known as the boneless vine, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thin, trailing stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Ceropegia scabra is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to climb or trail."
