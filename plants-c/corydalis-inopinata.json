    "intro": "Corydalis inopinata, commonly known as the Sierra larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and streambanks. The plant produces striking violet to blue flowers with spurred petals, which are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its ability to retain moisture. Corydalis inopinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators and providing habitat for small organisms."
