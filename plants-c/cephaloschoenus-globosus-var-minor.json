    "intro": "Cephaloschoenus globosus var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf swamp cypress, is a small, shrub-like plant native to wetland environments in eastern Australia. It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching a height of up to 30 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, which are typically greenish or brown in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or seasonally flooded areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
