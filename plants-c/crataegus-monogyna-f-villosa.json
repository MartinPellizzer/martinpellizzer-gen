    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna f. villosa, commonly known as the downy hawthorn, is a horticultural form of the common hawthorn. It is characterized by its hairy or pubescent leaves, which distinguish it from the typical form. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by red berries in the autumn. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy in temperate climates. This variety is well-suited for gardens and can thrive in a range of soil types."
