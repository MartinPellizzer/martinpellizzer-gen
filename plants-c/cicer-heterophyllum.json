    "intro": "Cicer heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces legume pods containing several seeds, which are typically small and oval in shape. Cicer heterophyllum is adapted to dry environments and has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a weed in some agricultural contexts."
