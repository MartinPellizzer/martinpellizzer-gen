It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically small and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
