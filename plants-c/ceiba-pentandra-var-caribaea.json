    "intro": "Ceiba pentandra var. caribaea, commonly known as the Royal Mahogany, is a large tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its towering height, often reaching up to 50 meters, and its buttressed roots that help it stabilize in nutrient-poor soils. The tree produces showy, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody pods containing flat, fibrous seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its strength and durability, making it a significant resource in local economies. The plant also plays an important ecological role, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
