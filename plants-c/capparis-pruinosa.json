    "intro": "Capparis pruinosa, commonly known as the white caper, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its pale green, often hairy stems and leaves that are oval-shaped with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, which are typically followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Capparis pruinosa is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its use in culinary applications, particularly in the preparation of capers."
