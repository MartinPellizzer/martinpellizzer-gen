    "intro": "Cochemiea hutchisoniana subsp. louisae, commonly known as the Mexican snowball cactus, is a succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white to grayish-blue foliage that resembles a ball of cotton. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used in rock gardens or as a container plant."
