    "intro": "Castanospermum brevivexillum, commonly known as the short-veined silky oak, is a member of the Sapotaceae family and is native to eastern Australia. It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy, dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a sticky resin, and it is known for its rapid growth rate in suitable conditions."
