It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of smaller leaflets. Cassia trichocraspedon is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
