    "intro": "Chaerophyllum claytonii, commonly known as Clayton's cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in an umbel, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
