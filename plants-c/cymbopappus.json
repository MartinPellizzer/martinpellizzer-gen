    "intro": "Cymbopappus, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a genus of flowering plants native to Australia. These shrubs are characterized by their narrow, linear leaves and distinctive, fluffy seed heads that resemble small clouds. They belong to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and are adapted to arid environments. Cymbopappus species are often found in sandy or rocky soils and are well-suited to dry climates. Their unique appearance and resilience make them popular in native gardens and ecological restoration projects."
