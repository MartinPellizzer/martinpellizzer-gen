    "intro": "Codonoprasum oleraceum, commonly known as garden sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish-purple in color, with a sour taste due to its high oxalic acid content. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Garden sorrel is valued both for its culinary use and as a decorative plant in gardens."
