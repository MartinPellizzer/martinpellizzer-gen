    "intro": "Catasetum pamplonaense, commonly known as the Pamplona orchid, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The flowers are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, spurred labellum that serves as a pollinator trap. It produces a unique type of pollen, known as \"pollinia,\" which is attached to the insect's body for transfer. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations."
