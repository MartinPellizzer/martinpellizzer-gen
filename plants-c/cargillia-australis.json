    "intro": "Cargillia australis, commonly known as the Southern sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has a robust, upright stem with narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Cargillia australis thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and ecological restoration projects."
