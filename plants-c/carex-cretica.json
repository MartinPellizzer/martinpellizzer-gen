    "intro": "Carex cretica, commonly known as the creeping sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex cretica is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
