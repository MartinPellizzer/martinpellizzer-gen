    "intro": "Coccineorchis dressleri, commonly known as the Red Lady's Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers, which are highly ornate and resemble the petals of a lady's dress, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, showy flower spike per plant. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Coccineorchis dressleri is considered a conservation concern."
