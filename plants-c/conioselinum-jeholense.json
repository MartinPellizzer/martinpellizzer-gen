    "intro": "Conioselinum jeholense, commonly known as the Jehol wormwood, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to northern China and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypselae, which are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
