    "intro": "Carex parvispica, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces capsule fruits that contain the seeds. Carex parvispica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
