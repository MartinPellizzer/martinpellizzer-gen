It features small, rounded leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, giving it a dense, foliage-heavy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This variety is particularly noted for its compact growth habit and year-round visual interest."
