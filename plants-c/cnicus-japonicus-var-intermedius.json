It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. This variant is distinguished by its intermediate characteristics between the typical C. japonicus and other related species."
