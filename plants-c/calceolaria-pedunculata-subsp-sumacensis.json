    "intro": "Calceolaria pedunculata subsp. sumacensis, commonly known as the Sumac Mountain slipperwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its distinctive calyces that resemble small slippers, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in cloud forests. Its flowers are usually bright red or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
