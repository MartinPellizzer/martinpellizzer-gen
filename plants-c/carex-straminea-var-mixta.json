    "intro": "Carex straminea var. mixta, commonly known as the mixed sedge, is a perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms compact clumps, with leaves that are typically light green to straw-colored. The plant produces small, spike-like flower clusters that are usually green to brown in color, appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
