    "intro": "Clematis villosa f. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clematis, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China. It features slender, arching stems with small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are densely covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of white and pale blue. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, flowering shrub."
