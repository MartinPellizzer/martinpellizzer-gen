    "intro": "Cymbopogon queenslandicus, commonly known as the Queensland grass or Queensland lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along watercourses. Its essential oils, particularly citral, make it valuable for culinary and aromatic purposes."
