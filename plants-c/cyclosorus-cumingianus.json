    "intro": "Cyclosorus cumingianus, commonly known as the Cuming's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often divided into small, lobed segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds and lakes, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Cyclosorus cumingianus plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
