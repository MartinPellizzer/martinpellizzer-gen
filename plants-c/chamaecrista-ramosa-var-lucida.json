    "intro": "Chamaecrista ramosa var. lucida, commonly known as the shining crownflower, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive silvery-blue appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its small, oblong seeds are encased in a leathery pod that splits open when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
