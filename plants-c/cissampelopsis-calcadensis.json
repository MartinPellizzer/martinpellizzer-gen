    "intro": "Cissampelopsis calcadensis, commonly known as the Madagascar star vine, is a climbing plant native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its thin, wiry stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped white flowers, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
