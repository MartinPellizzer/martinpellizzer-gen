    "intro": "Cerasus longifolius, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or sakura, is a species of flowering plant in the Prunus genus. It is native to Japan and is renowned for its showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 10 meters. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a glossy appearance. The fruit, a small cherry-like drupe, is edible but less commonly consumed compared to other Prunus species."
