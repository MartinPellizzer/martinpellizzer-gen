    "intro": "Cytisus chamaecytisus, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It features slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant is adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
