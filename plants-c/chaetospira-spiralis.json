    "intro": "Chaetospira spiralis, commonly known as the spiral hairworm, is a parasitic nematode with a distinctive coiled body structure. It belongs to the family Sphaerostomataceae and is primarily found in freshwater environments. The adult worms are typically long and slender, with a segmented body that allows for flexible movement. They are known to parasitize various aquatic invertebrates, such as crustaceans and insects. The life cycle of Chaetospira spiralis involves both free-living and parasitic stages, depending on the host and environmental conditions."
