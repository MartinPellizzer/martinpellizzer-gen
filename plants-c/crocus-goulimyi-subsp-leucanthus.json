It features showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, round bulbs that are used for propagation. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and delicate appearance."
