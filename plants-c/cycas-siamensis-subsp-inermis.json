    "intro": "Cycas siamensis subsp. inermis, commonly known as the Siam cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically appearing on separate plants. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in its native range."
