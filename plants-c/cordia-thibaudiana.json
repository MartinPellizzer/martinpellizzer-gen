    "intro": "Cordia thibaudiana, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by woody, orange-red fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in dry woodlands and savannas. The tree is valued for its hard, heavy wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
