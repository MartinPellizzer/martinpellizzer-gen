    "intro": "Cocos arechavaletana, commonly known as the Arechavaleta coconut, is a rare and lesser-known species of coconut palm native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its slender, tall trunk and elongated, narrow leaves that give it a distinct appearance compared to more common coconut varieties. The plant produces small, hairy fruits that contain a single, edible kernel, similar to other coconut species. It thrives in coastal areas with well-drained soil and is adapted to the unique climate of the Canary Islands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
