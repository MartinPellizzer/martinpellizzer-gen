It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit. The fronds are typically narrow and elongated, with a soft, moss-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on rocky substrates. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
