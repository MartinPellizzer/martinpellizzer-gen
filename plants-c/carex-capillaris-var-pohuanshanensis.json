    "intro": "Carex capillaris var. pohuanshanensis, commonly known as the Pohuanshan sedge, is a variant of the slender sedge species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. The botanical features of this variant make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
