    "intro": "Capparis poggei, commonly known as the Sicilian caper, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Capparaceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, edible capers used in culinary applications. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Capparis poggei is also notable for its ability to thrive in rocky and coastal environments."
