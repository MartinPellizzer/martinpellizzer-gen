It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and have a waxy coating. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences near the water's surface.
