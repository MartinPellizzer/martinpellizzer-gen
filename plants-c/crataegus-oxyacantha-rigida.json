    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha rigida, commonly known as the rigid hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features thorny branches and is characterized by its showy white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. The rigid hawthorn is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
