    "intro": "Coccoloba zernyi, commonly known as the Red Mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America, typically found in coastal areas and brackish water environments. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline conditions. It also produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
