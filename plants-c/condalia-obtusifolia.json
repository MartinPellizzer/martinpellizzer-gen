    "intro": "Condalia obtusifolia, commonly known as the African velvetleaf, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by round, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it is considered a weed in some areas."
