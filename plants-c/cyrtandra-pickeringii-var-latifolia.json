    "intro": "Cyrtandra pickeringii var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Its flowers are often visited by native bees and other pollinators, contributing to local biodiversity. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
