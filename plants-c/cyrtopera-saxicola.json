    "intro": "Cyrtopera saxicola, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in rocky, arid environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form, which adheres tightly to rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a smooth or slightly cracked surface. It is often found in Mediterranean and temperate regions, growing on limestone and sandstone substrates. This lichen plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem."
