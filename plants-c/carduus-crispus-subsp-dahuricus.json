    "intro": "Carduus crispus subsp. dahuricus, commonly known as the Siberian thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It features a robust taproot and upright, sparsely branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall. The plant produces large, yellow composite flowers with a distinctive purple-tinged center, surrounded by pale yellow ray florets. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, and are deeply lobed with a wavy margin. This species is known for its aggressive growth and is considered an invasive weed in many regions outside its native range."
