    "intro": "Carex comans, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikelets of brownish flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex comans is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
