    "intro": "Cephalodendron globosum, commonly known as the globe-headed cedar, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Podocarpaceae. It is characterized by its unique, globular-shaped cones that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are densely packed, contributing to its overall compact appearance. The botanical features of Cephalodendron globosum make it an intriguing subject for study in both ecological and evolutionary contexts."
