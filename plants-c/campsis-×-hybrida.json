    "intro": "Campsis \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the scarlet trumpetbush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Campsis radicans (the common flame bush) and Campsis \u00d7 williamsonii. The plant is characterized by its showy, tubular, orange-red flowers that appear in summer, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with serrated margins, and it produces woody, capsule-like fruits containing orange seeds. Campsis \u00d7 hybrida is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
