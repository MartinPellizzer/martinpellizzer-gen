    "intro": "Centella comptonii, commonly known as the African pennywort, is a small, creeping perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of vegetation. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Centella comptonii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
