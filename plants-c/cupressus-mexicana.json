    "intro": "Cupressus mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the highlands of central Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, columnar form and its dark green, scale-like leaves that are arranged in crossed pairs. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
