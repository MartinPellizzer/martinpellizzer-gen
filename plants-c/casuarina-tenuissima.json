    "intro": "Casuarina tenuissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, needle-like leaves that are arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often forming dense thickets. Casuarina tenuissima is valued for its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
