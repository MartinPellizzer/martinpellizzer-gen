    "intro": "Cissus trothae, commonly known as the climbing fig or silver leaf cissus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit and its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery or pale green waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage. Cissus trothae is also valued for its ability to climb and trail, making it suitable for hanging baskets or as a ground cover."
