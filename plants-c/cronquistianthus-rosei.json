    "intro": "Cronquistianthus rosei, commonly known as the rose-flowered cronquist, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Cronquistiaceae family and is characterized by its striking pink to purple petals and dense, clustered inflorescence. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
