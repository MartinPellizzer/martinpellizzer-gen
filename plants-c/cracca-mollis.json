    "intro": "Cracca mollis, commonly known as the slender cracca, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in spring, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. Cracca mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
