    "intro": "Coryanthes mystax, commonly known as the curling hibiscus, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a curling ribbon, with a unique structure that includes a central column and a hood-like lip. The plant produces nectar-rich flowers that attract specific pollinators, such as certain species of bees and flies. Its foliage consists of large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Coryanthes mystax thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
