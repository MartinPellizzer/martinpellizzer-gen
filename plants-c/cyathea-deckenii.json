    "intro": "Cyathea deckenii, commonly known as the Decken's tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a large, evergreen fern that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a rhizome that produces both roots and new shoots, allowing it to form clumps over time. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent and can be used for medicinal purposes in traditional practices. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
