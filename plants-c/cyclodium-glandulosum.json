    "intro": "Cyclodium glandulosum, commonly known as the woolly burr, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces cylindrical, spiny seed pods that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Cyclodium glandulosum is a perennial shrub that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
