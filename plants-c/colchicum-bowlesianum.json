    "intro": "Colchicum bowlesianum, commonly known as the Bowles' autumn crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces striking violet-blue or purple flowers in late summer to early autumn, typically from September to November. The plant has a distinctive, narrow, grass-like foliage that emerges in early spring. Its bulbs contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, often found in woodland edges and rocky areas."
