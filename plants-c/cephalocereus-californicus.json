    "intro": "Cephalocereus californicus, commonly known as the California night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and spines that are typically white or yellow. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its striking floral display makes it a popular choice for desert gardens and botanical collections."
