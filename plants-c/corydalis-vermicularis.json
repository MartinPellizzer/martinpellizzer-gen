    "intro": "Corydalis vermicularis, commonly known as the creeping lousewort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fumariaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is native to regions of Europe and Asia. The plant features slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with two upper petals that curve backward, resembling a louse, hence its common name. Corydalis vermicularis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes."
