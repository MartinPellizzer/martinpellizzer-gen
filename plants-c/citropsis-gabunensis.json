    "intro": "Citropsis gabunensis, commonly known as the Gabon papyrus, is a flowering plant native to Central Africa. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fibrous fruits. It thrives in wetland or swampy environments and is often found in the understory of dense rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
