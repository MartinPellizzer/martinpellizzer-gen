    "intro": "Choerospondias axillaris var. axillaris, commonly known as the Indian chestnut or wild chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnate, with serrated margins. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits. Its bark is rough and fissured, often shedding in flakes as the tree matures. This species is valued for its hard wood and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
