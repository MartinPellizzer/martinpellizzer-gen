    "intro": "Calamagrostis nana, commonly known as dwarf reed or little reed, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, making it a compact and elegant plant suitable for small garden spaces. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces feathery plumes in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Calamagrostis nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
