    "intro": "Cedrela tubiflora var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered cedrela, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, elliptic leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is of interest for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
