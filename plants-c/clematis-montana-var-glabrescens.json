It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale blue, appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it an excellent choice for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
