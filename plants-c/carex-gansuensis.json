It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in a panicle inflorescence. Carex gansuensis is valued for its ornamental potential and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
