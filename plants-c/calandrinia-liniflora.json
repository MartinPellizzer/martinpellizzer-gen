    "intro": "Calandrinia liniflora, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
