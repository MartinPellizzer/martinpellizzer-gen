    "intro": "Crucianella decumbens, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It typically forms dense mats on sandy or rocky soils, often in maritime environments. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers. Its flowers are typically borne on short pedicels and are adapted for wind pollination. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, saline conditions, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
