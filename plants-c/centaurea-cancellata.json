    "intro": "Centaurea cancellata, commonly known as the white centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and can be found in Mediterranean climates. The plant features bright yellow flowers that are surrounded by a ring of white or pale blue bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Centaurea cancellata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
