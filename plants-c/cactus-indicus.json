    "intro": "Cactus indicus, commonly known as the Indian cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan. It is a spiny, succulent plant that stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry environments. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with cylindrical or branching stems covered in sharp spines. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters during the rainy season. The leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and the plant is well adapted to hot, drought-prone climates."
