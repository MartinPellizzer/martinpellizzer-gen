    "intro": "Cenchrus echinoides, commonly known as the roughhairs grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth and narrow, bluish-green leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
