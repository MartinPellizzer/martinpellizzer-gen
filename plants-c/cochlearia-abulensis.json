    "intro": "Cochlearia abulensis, commonly known as the Abulensis Horned Poppy, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with four petals that curve backward, giving it a unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cochlearia abulensis is considered a vulnerable species."
