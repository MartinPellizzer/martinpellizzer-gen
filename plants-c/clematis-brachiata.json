    "intro": "Clematis brachiata, commonly known as the climbing clematis, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia. It features slender, twining stems that can grow up to 10 meters in length, allowing it to climb and spread across supports. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers with a subtle fragrance, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, compound, and often have a delicate, feathery appearance. Clematis brachiata prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
