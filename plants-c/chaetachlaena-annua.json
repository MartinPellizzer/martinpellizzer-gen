    "intro": "Chaetachlaena annua, commonly known as the annual spike moss, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
