    "intro": "Convolvulus erinaceus, commonly known as the hedge bindweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste grounds. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
