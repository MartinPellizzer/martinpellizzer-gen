    "intro": "Cynometra pervilleana, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sterculiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, brown seeds. It is often found in moist, lowland forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
