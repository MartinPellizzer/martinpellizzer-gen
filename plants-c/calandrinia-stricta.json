    "intro": "Calandrinia stricta, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is a small annual herb with erect, branching stems and fleshy, linear leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, which open in the morning and close by midday. Calandrinia stricta is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with succulent leaves and a deep root system to conserve water. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
