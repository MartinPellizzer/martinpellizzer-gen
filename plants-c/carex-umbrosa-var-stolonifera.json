    "intro": "Carex umbrosa var. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in wetland areas. This variety is often found in bogs, swamps, and other wet habitats where it thrives in low light conditions."
