    "intro": "Cyathea lepidoclada, commonly known as the velvet tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a velvety texture. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
