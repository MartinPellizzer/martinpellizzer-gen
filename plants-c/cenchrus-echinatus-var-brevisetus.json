    "intro": "Cenchrus echinatus var. brevisetus, commonly known as the short-bristled sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive drought conditions. This species is often used for soil stabilization and has some traditional uses in local communities."
