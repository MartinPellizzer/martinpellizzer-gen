    "intro": "Caladium schmitzii, commonly known as the Schmitz's arrowleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that display vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it popular in gardens and as a houseplant. Caladium schmitzii is typically propagated through division or tuberous roots, and it blooms with small, inconspicuous white flowers that are not usually visible above the foliage."
