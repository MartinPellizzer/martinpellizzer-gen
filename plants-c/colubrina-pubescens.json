The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The hairy colubrina is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
