    "intro": "Chaptalia hieracioides, commonly known as the common hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of hawksbeard, hence its common name. The yellow flowers bloom in late summer and are followed by fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
