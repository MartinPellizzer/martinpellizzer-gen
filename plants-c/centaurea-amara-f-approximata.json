    "intro": "Centaurea amara f. approximata, commonly known as the bitterweed or bitter centaury, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, erect stems that are often branched and covered with fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, surrounded by pale blue to purplish bracts. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with a rough, glandular surface that contributes to its bitter taste. This variety is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields."
