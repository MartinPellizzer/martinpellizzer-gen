    "intro": "Carex salina var. pseudofilipendula, commonly known as the salt marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety thrives in saline or brackish wetlands, tolerating high salt concentrations and periodic flooding. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in marsh environments. The plant plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
