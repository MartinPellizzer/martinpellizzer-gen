    "intro": "Chimaphila occidentalis, commonly known as the western pinyon. It is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the western United States, typically found in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ability to retain moisture. Chimaphila occidentalis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
