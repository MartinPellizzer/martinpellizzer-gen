    "intro": "Carex incurva var. melanocystis, commonly known as black-tipped sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its dark brown to black bracts give it its distinctive appearance, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments. It is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated conditions."
