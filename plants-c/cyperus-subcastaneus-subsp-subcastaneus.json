    "intro": "Cyperus subcastaneus subsp. subcastaneus, commonly known as the red swamp sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has slender, triangular stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are linear with a waxy surface. It produces small, three-lobed flowers arranged in spikes, which are usually greenish or reddish in hue. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
