    "intro": "Chironia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky chironia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in whorled arrangements, and come in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The sticky secretions from its leaves may play a role in deterring herbivores or trapping small insects."
