    "intro": "Cupania frutescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Brazilian cherry, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. Cupania frutescens is also known for its potential medicinal uses in traditional medicine."
