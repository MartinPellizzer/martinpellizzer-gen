It is characterized by its compact, rock-like appearance, with fleshy, triangular leaves that form a dense, rounded cluster. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Conophytum senarium is often cultivated for its unique aesthetic and low maintenance requirements."
