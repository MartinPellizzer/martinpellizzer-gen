    "intro": "Cyanea stictophylla var. inermis, commonly known as the Hawaiian sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has adapted to the tropical climate with its succulent leaves and fleshy stems. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by water and wind. This variety is distinguished by its lack of spines on the stems, giving it a more delicate appearance compared to other Cyanea species."
