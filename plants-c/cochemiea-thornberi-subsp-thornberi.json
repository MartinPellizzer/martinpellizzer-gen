    "intro": "Cochemiea thornberi subsp. thornberi, commonly known as the Thornber's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in small, spiny areoles, which bear clusters of white, woolly flowers. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and distinctive appearance."
