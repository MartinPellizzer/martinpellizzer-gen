It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it a unique appearance. The plant is a shrub or small tree, typically growing up to 5 meters in height. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a silvery or grayish hue. Ceroxylon niveum is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in cool, humid conditions."
