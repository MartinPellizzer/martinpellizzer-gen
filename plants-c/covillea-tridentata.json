    "intro": "Covillea tridentata, commonly known as the three-lobed milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces pods that contain seeds with silky hairs for wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Covillea tridentata plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators, including butterflies and bees."
