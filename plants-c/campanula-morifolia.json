    "intro": "Campanula morifolia, commonly known as the bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Campanula morifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
