    "intro": "Centella triloba, commonly known as Asiatic pennywort, is a creeping herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread quickly, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil. Centella triloba is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
