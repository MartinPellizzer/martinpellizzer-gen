    "intro": "Ceropegia mammillaris, commonly known as the dwarf string of hearts, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It features succulent, fleshy stems that are often covered in small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ceropegia mammillaris is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
