    "intro": "Cupressus lindleyi var. alba, commonly known as the white Mexican cypress, is a rare and ornamental conifer native to Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its distinctive white to pale blue foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, round cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a landscape specimen. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species in the wild."
