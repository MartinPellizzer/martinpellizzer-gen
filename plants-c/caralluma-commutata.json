    "intro": "Caralluma commutata, commonly known as the Indian figleaf cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and spiny leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a resilient species in harsh climates."
