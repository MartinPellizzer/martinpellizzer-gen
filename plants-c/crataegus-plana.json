    "intro": "Crataegus plana, commonly known as the flatleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are typically 2\u20136 cm in length and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Crataegus plana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also valued for its ecological benefits to wildlife."
