    "intro": "Carex longhiensis, commonly known as the longleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly rough to the touch. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in early summer, adding subtle floral interest to its appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along stream edges. Carex longhiensis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
