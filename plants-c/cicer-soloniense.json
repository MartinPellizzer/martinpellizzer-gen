    "intro": "Cicer soloniense, commonly known as the Solon bean, is a rare and lesser-known legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of many members of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces pods containing small, round seeds that are often used in traditional herbal medicine. Cicer soloniense is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
