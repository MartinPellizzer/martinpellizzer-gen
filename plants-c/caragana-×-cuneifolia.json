The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, followed by pea-like pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating drought, poor soils, and extreme temperatures. Caragana \u00d7 cuneifolia is often used for erosion control and as a ornamental plant in colder regions."
