    "intro": "Croton betiokensis var. haplostylis, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed croton, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It features opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that vary in shape from ovate to elliptic. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
