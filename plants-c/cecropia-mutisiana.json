It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, making it a common sight in secondary forests and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by animals, contributing to its widespread distribution. The tree also has a symbiotic relationship with ants, which protect it from herbivores in exchange for shelter and food."
