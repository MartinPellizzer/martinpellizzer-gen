    "intro": "Carex capillaris f. typica, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes. Native to wetland and marshy environments, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and is often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
