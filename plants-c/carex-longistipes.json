    "intro": "Carex longistipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Carex longistipes is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
