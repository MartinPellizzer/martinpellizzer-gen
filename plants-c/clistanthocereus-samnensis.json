    "intro": "Clistanthocereus samnensis, commonly known as the Sonoran moon cactus, is a flowering cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its striking red or pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a short, thick stem with a distinctive swollen base, which stores water for survival in arid conditions. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
