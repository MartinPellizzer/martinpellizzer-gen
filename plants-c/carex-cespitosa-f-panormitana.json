    "intro": "Carex cespitosa f. panormitana, commonly known as the Panormitana sedge, is a variant of the common sedges, characterized by its compact, clumping growth habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are usually greenish or reddish in hue, typical of the Carex genus. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
