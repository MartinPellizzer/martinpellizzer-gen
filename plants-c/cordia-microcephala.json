    "intro": "Cordia microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed cottonwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and oval-shaped leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in coastal and tropical environments, often growing in sandy or limestone soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
