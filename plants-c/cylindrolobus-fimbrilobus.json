    "intro": "Cylindrolobus fimbrilobus, commonly known as the slender-lobed cypripedium, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical pseudobulbs and showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, erect flower spike with a complex, three-lobed structure. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
