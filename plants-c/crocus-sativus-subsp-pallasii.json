    "intro": "Crocus sativus subsp. pallasii, commonly known as the Pallas' saffron crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking violet to purple flowers with three petals and three sepals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette. While related to the saffron crocus, it is less commonly cultivated for its stigmas, which are used in culinary and medicinal applications."
