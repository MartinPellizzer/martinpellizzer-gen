    "intro": "Calamagrostis menhoferi, commonly known as the Menhofer's reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are usually golden to brown in color. Calamagrostis menhoferi plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
