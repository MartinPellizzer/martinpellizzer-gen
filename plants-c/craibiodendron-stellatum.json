    "intro": "Craibiodendron stellatum, commonly known as the star-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often star-shaped, giving it its common name. It produces small white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked."
