    "intro": "Carterella, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the humid, shaded environment it inhabits. Due to its rarity and unique features, Carterella is of great interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
