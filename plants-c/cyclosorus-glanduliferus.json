    "intro": "Cyclosorus glanduliferus, commonly known as the glandular cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically four-lobed and often covered with tiny glands. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures, including small flowers and fruits, are adapted for water dispersal. Cyclosorus glanduliferus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
