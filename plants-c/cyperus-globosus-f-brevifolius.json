    "intro": "Cyperus globosus f. brevifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved umbrella sedge, is a compact, herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features dense clusters of grass-like leaves that are shorter and narrower than those of the typical species, giving it a unique, compact appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of water bodies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water gardens and bog landscapes."
