    "intro": "Celtis lamarckiana, commonly known as the French hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Ulmaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, spherical berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Celtis lamarckiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate urban environments."
