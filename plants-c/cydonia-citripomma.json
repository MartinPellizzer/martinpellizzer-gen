    "intro": "Cydonia citripomma, commonly known as the golden quince, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It produces fragrant, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by large, fleshy fruits that ripen in late summer. The fruit has a thick, aromatic skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp with a texture similar to a pear. It is often used in cooking, particularly in jams and preserves, due to its high pectin content. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
