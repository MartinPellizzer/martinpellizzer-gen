    "intro": "Ctenitis parvula, commonly known as the small-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Ctenitis parvula is notable for its compact growth habit and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
