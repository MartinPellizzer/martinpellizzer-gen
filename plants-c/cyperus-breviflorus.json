    "intro": "Cyperus breviflorus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in clusters at the base of the plant. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Cyperus breviflorus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
