    "intro": "Cyrtandra wahiawaensis, commonly known as the Wahiawa Cyrtandra, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories on the island of Oahu. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts."
