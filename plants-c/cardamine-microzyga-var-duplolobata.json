It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically lobed. The plant produces small white or yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
