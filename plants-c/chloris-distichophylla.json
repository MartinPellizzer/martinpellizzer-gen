    "intro": "Chloris distichophylla, commonly known as the two-row grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are borne on slender panicles. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Chloris distichophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its fine texture and drought tolerance."
