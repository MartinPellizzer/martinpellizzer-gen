    "intro": "Cissus tenuifolia, commonly known as the creeping grape ivy, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by translucent, waxy berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and vertical gardens. Its ability to climb or trail makes it versatile for various landscaping applications."
