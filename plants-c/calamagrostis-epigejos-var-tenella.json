It features narrow, silver-blue foliage that forms a dense, upright clump, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces delicate, pale green to golden inflorescences that add visual interest in the autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This variety is prized for its low maintenance and ability to add texture and color to gardens."
