It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae, which includes other species known for their vibrant, flame-like flowers. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are bright red and resemble the shape of a kangaroo's paw, hence its common name.
