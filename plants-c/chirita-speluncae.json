    "intro": "Chirita speluncae, commonly known as the cave chirita, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to life in dark, humid cave environments. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate, tubular flowers. The plant relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor cave soils. Its flowering is typically triggered by the presence of specific pollinators that have adapted to the low-light conditions. Due to its restricted habitat, Chirita speluncae is considered endangered and is often found in subterranean ecosystems."
