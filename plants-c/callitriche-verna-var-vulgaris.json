    "intro": "Callitriche verna var. vulgaris, commonly known as early water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic herbaceous plant. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often near the edges of ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often floating or submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are usually oval or lance-shaped. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale blue, and clustered in dense inflorescences, making it a common sight in freshwater habitats. It is an important part of the aquatic ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
