    "intro": "Cyanus pinnatifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blueweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in dry, sunny habitats. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, delicate blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and pinnatifid, meaning they are deeply divided, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. Cyanus pinnatifidus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
