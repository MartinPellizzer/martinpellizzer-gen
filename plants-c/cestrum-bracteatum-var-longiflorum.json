    "intro": "Cestrum bracteatum var. longiflorum, commonly known as the long-flowered cestrum, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically bloom in clusters, often in shades of white, yellow, or pink. The plant is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The plant's rapid growth and seasonal blooming make it a versatile addition to both landscape designs and container gardens."
