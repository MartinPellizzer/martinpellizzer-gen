    "intro": "Coincya rupestris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble those of true ferns. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices and shaded areas, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy layer to reduce water loss. Coincya rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized gardens or as a houseplant."
