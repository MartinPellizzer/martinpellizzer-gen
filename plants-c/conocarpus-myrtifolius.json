    "intro": "Conocarpus myrtifolius, commonly known as the mangrove apple or white mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize shorelines and filter water. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves with a leathery texture and is often found in brackish or saltwater environments. Its small, pinkish flowers are followed by edible, orange-red fruits that contain a single seed. This species plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
