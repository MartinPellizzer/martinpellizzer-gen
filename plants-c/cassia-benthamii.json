    "intro": "Cassia benthamii, commonly known as the yellow cassia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences, which consist of numerous small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Cassia benthamii is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
