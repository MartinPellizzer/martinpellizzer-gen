    "intro": "Coryphantha echinus, commonly known as the spiny hedgehog cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in spines, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its arid habitat. Coryphantha echinus is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a resilient plant in desert environments. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native ecosystem."
