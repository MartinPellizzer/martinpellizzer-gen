    "intro": "Coleogyne ramosissima, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its branching stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features include hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Coleogyne ramosissima is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
