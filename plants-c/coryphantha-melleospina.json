    "intro": "Coryphantha melleospina, commonly known as the honey-tipped cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed stem that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 15 centimeters. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by small, red fruits. Its stems are covered in fine, white spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Coryphantha melleospina is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
