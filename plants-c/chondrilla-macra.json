    "intro": "Chondrilla macra, commonly known as the tall glassworts, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in saline or brackish environments. The plant has succulent, cylindrical stems that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense, terminal clusters and bloom during the summer months. Chondrilla macra is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
