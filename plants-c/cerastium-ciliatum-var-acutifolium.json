    "intro": "Cerastium ciliatum var. acutifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leaved mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves with a hairy texture and serrated edges, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with four petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an effective pioneer species in ecological succession."
