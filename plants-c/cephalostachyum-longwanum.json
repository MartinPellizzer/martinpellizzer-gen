    "intro": "Cephalostachyum longwanum, commonly known as the longwanum clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the spores for reproduction. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
