    "intro": "Cochlearia armoracia var. aquatica, commonly known as water cabbages, is a coastal plant native to the British Isles and parts of northern Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or shingle soils along the shoreline, often in areas subject to tidal influence. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
