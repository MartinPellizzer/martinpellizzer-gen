    "intro": "Coelogyne ambangensis, commonly known as the Ambangensis orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its humid, shaded habitat. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the base of the plant. Coelogyne ambangensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
