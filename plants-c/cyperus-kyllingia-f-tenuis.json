    "intro": "Cyperus kyllingia f. tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flower heads that typically bloom in late summer. The plant prefers wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wetlands, and is native to parts of Asia and Australia. Its morphology includes a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
