    "intro": "Cynanchum tuberculatum, commonly known as the warty milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruit is a follicle that contains several seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots that help it access water from lower soil layers. Cynanchum tuberculatum is also known for its latex-like sap, which can be toxic to some animals and humans."
