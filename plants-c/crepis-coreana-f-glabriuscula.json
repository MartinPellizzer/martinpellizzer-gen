    "intro": "Crepis coreana f. glabriuscula, commonly known as the Korean mouse-ear cichorium, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Korea and thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or grassland habitats. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, though the 'glabriuscula' form has reduced hair, giving it a smoother appearance."
