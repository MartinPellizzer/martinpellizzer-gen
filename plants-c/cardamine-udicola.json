    "intro": "Cardamine udicola, commonly known as the narrowleaf water crowfoot, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are typically submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Cardamine udicola thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. Its presence is often an indicator of clean, oxygen-rich water in its habitat."
