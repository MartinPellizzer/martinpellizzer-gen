It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically brownish in color, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
