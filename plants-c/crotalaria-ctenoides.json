    "intro": "Crotalaria ctenoides, commonly known as the hairy crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or bean family, and is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny pod, and the plant often grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Crotalaria ctenoides is sometimes used in traditional medicine but can be toxic if ingested."
