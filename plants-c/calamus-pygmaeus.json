    "intro": "Calamus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf calamus, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Arecaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a slender, creeping rhizome with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces dark, round berries as its fruit. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
