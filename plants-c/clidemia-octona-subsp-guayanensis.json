    "intro": "Clidemia octona subsp. guayanensis, commonly known as the Guayana mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its ecological role within its native habitat."
