    "intro": "Cryptantha gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, particularly in gypsum-rich environments, and is adapted to drought conditions. Its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit make it well-suited for xeriscaping. Cryptantha gypsophila plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and supports local pollinators."
