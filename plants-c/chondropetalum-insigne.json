    "intro": "Chondropetalum insigne, commonly known as the noble fern, is a perennial fern species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with prominent, tooth-like serrations. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Chondropetalum insigne is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, feathery appearance."
