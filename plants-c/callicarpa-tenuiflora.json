It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces vibrant purple berries in the fall, which are a key feature for both ornamental and ecological purposes. These berries are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
