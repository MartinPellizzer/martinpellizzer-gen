    "intro": "Carex canina, commonly known as dog sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has cylindrical, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and stiff in texture. Its inflorescence consists of a cluster of small, three-sided spikelets that are often reddish or brownish in color. Carex canina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
