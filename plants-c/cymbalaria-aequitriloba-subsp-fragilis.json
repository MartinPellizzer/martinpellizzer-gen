    "intro": "Cymbalaria aequitriloba subsp. fragilis, commonly known as the slender bedstraw, is a low-growing annual herb belonging to the Primulaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its delicate structure and rapid growth, it is considered a common weed in various parts of its native range."
