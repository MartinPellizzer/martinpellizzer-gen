    "intro": "Cuscuta planiflora subsp. godronii, commonly known as the Godron's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant is native to regions of southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically attaches to a variety of host plants, including grasses and shrubs, using specialized haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host."
