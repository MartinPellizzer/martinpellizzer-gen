    "intro": "Caucalis pedunculata, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with rhizomatous roots that allow it to spread rapidly across moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often remain green throughout the winter, giving it a distinctive appearance. Caucalis pedunculata is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in rich, moist soils."
