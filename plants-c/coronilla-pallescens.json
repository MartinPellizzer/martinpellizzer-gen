    "intro": "Coronilla pallescens, commonly known as the pale coronilla, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Coronilla pallescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
