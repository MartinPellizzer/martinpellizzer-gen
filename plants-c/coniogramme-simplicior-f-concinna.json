    "intro": "Coniogramme simplicior f. concinna, commonly known as the narrow-leaf coniogramme, is a rare fern species characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with closely spaced, bipinnate leaves that are typically a dark green color. Its foliage is often adorned with small, rounded sori on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
