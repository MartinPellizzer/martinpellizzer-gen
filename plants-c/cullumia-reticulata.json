It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Cullumia reticulata is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems."
