    "intro": "Carex sempervirens subsp. firma, commonly known as hardy sedge, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that remains evergreen throughout the year. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a versatile choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its upright growth habit and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
