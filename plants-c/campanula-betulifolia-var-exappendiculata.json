    "intro": "Campanula betulifolia var. exappendiculata, commonly known as the silverleaf bellflower, is a rare and striking member of the Campanulaceae family. It is characterized by its silvery-white, hairy foliage and bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun. Its unique morphology, including the elongated, hairy leaves and clustered inflorescences, makes it a distinctive ornamental plant. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
