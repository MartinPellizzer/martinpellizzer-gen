    "intro": "Cyperus aromaticus var. repens, commonly known as creeping flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense mats near water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in wetland areas. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
