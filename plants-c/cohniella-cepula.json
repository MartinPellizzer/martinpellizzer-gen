    "intro": "Cohniella cepula, commonly known as the red cup lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive red or orange upper surface with a white or gray lower surface. The thallus is leathery and loosely attached to its substrate, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. It reproduces through the release of soredia, which are tiny, dust-like structures containing both algae and fungal cells. This lichen is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
