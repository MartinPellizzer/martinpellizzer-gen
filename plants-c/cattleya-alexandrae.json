    "intro": "Cattleya alexandrae, commonly known as the Alexandra orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Brazil. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Cattleya alexandrae is prized for its beauty and is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
