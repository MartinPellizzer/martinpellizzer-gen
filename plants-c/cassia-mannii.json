    "intro": "Cassia mannii, commonly known as the African cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically odd-pinnate with 7 to 15 pairs of leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, followed by long, slender pods containing flat, seed-rich seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Cassia mannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in various African cultures."
