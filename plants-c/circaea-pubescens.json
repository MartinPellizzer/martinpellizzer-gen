    "intro": "Circaea pubescens, commonly known as the white geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its hairy texture, with \"pubescens\" meaning \"covered in hair\" in Latin."
