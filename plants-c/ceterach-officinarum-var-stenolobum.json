    "intro": "Ceterach officinarum var. stenolobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed rock fern, is a perennial fern native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. The plant has a compact growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, elongated segments. Its reproductive structures are borne on sporangia that develop on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its ability to tolerate saline conditions and is often used in coastal landscaping."
