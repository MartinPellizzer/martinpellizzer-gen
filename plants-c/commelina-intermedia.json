    "intro": "Commelina intermedia, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet bracts that surround the small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Commelina intermedia is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, making it a common sight in wetland habitats."
