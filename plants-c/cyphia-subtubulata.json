    "intro": "Cyphia subtubulata, commonly known as the subtubular cyphia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that often display vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has a compact, shrub-like appearance. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems, while its flowers bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, Cyphia subtubulata is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
