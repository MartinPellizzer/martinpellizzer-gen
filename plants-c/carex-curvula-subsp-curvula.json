    "intro": "Carex curvula subsp. curvula, commonly known as the curly sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its distinctive curling leaf blades, which give it its common name. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
