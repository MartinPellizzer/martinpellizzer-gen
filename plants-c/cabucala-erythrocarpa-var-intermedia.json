    "intro": "Cabucala erythrocarpa var. intermedia, commonly known as the red-fruited cabucala, is a rare and unique variant of the cabucala plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red, fleshy berries that mature in the dry season, which are edible but often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires moderate to high levels of sunlight. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a slightly waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, this variant is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
