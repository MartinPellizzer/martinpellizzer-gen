    "intro": "Cymopterus terebinthinus var. petraeus, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Its botanical features reflect its adaptation to harsh, arid conditions, making it a resilient member of desert flora."
