    "intro": "Cereus speciosissimus var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed beauty cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of white, night-blooming flowers. The plant features sharp, cylindrical spines and is adapted to arid environments. It thrives in full sun and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
