    "intro": "Cochleanthes lipscombiae, commonly known as the Lipscomb's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, intricate flower structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, with a unique coloration that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cochleanthes lipscombiae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
