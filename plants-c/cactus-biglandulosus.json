    "intro": "Cactus biglandulosus, commonly known as the biglandular cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its structure and adaptations reflect its role as a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
