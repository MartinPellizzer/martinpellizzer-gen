    "intro": "Carex bromoides subsp. bromoides, commonly known as the common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental potential in water gardens."
