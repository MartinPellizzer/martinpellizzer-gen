    "intro": "Chrysosplenium scouleri, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has rounded, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common sight in alpine and subalpine habitats."
