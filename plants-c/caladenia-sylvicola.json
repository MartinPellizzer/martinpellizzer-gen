    "intro": "Caladenia sylvicola, commonly known as the forest orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in areas with rich, well-drained soils. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears a single, strikingly colored flower with a distinctive labellum. Its flowers are usually pink or pale purple, with a narrow, spurred petal that aids in pollination by insects. Caladenia sylvicola is a rare and protected species, highlighting its ecological significance in its native habitat."
