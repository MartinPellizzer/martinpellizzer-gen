It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often colorful flowers. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical species, hence its subspecies name. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
