    "intro": "Centaurea scabiosa var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf coneflower, is a compact perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that bear small, spiky flower heads composed of blue to purple ray florets and yellow disk florets. The plant produces a distinctive, thistle-like appearance with its tightly packed flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
