It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically light green to blue-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of inconspicuous flowers, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as wetlands and marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
