    "intro": "Chrysophyllum maytenoides var. myrtifolium, commonly known as the African cherry or myrtle-leaved chrysophyllum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It features lanceolate to ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a distinctive myrtle-like fragrance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by edible, sweet-tart red berries. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Its ornamental value and edible fruits make it both a horticultural and ecological significant species."
