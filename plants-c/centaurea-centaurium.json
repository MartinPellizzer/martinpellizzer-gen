    "intro": "Centaurea centaurium, commonly known as common centaury, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual or biennial herb that grows up to 60 cm tall, featuring slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive central disk and ray florets, typically blooming from June to September. Its seeds are small and contained in a pappus-covered capsule, aiding in wind dispersal. Centaurea centaurium thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas."
