    "intro": "Cucurbita hippopera, commonly known as the horse-gourd, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive, elongated fruits. The plant produces large, green, hollow fruits that mature to a pale yellow or white color, often with a warty surface. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blooms. The vine is typically cultivated for its edible fruits, though they are often used in traditional medicine and as a vegetable in certain cuisines. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
