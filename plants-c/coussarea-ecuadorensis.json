    "intro": "Coussarea ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian coussarea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
