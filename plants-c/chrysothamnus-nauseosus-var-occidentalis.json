    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus var. occidentalis, commonly known as western bitterbrush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and silver-green foliage, which provide habitat and food for various wildlife species. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and mountain slopes. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss and enhancing its drought tolerance."
