    "intro": "Cereus senilis, commonly known as the old man of the south, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stem and clusters of white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a slow growth rate and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Cereus senilis is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit."
