    "intro": "Cerasus avium fastigiata, commonly known as the upright cherry tree, is a cultivar of the Prunus avium species. It is characterized by its dense, columnar growth habit, making it an ideal choice for small spaces or urban landscapes. The plant produces small, sweet fruits similar to cherries, though they are typically smaller and less commonly cultivated for consumption. Its foliage is dark green and provides ornamental value throughout the growing season. The tree is relatively hardy and adaptable to various soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions."
