    "intro": "Corymbia ferruginea subsp. stypophylla, commonly known as the red blood gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the coastal regions of southern Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, fissured bark that ranges from pink to reddish-brown, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy when young. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, spherical fruits. It is adapted to sandy soils and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species suitable for coastal environments."
