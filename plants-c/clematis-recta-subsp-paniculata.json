    "intro": "Clematis recta subsp. paniculata, commonly known as the panicled clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and it produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its vigorous climbing habit makes it suitable for trellises or arbors, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
