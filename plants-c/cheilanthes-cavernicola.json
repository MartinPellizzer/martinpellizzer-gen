    "intro": "Cheilanthes cavernicola, commonly known as the cave rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in limestone and rocky habitats, often found in caves and crevices where it receives minimal light. The plant has a compact, creeping growth habit with rhizomes that anchor it to the substrate. Its fronds are typically small, leathery, and have a dark green color with a waxy coating. This species is adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its resilience and ornamental appearance."
