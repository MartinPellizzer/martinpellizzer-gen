    "intro": "Cnestidium, commonly known as the bladder fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cnestidioideae. These plants are characterized by their unique, bladder-like structures called caryopses, which are specialized for seed dispersal. The leaves of Cnestidium species are usually simple and alternate, with a distinctive appearance that aids in identification. They thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The genus includes several species, each adapted to specific ecological niches within their native habitats."
