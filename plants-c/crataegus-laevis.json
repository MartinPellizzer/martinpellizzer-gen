    "intro": "Crataegus laevis, commonly known as the smooth hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits called pomes. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges and open fields. Crataegus laevis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical uses in traditional medicine."
