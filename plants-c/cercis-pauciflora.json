    "intro": "Cercis pauciflora, commonly known as the Chinese red bean tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are alternate and pinnately arranged, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Cercis pauciflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance."
