    "intro": "Calea caracasana var. glabrior, commonly known as the sacred candle plant, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, candle-like inflorescence composed of numerous white to pale yellow ray florets. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the varietal name \"glabrior\" suggests a smoother texture compared to the typical form. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's unique appearance and cultural significance make it a notable species in botanical studies and horticulture."
