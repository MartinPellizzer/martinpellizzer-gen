    "intro": "Cousinia pergamacea, commonly known as the parchmentweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant is notable for its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh, dry environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cousinia pergamacea is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability."
