    "intro": "Cyperus leucolepis, commonly known as the silver flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedge plants, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it often serves as a pioneer species in disturbed wetland habitats. Cyperus leucolepis is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated soils."
