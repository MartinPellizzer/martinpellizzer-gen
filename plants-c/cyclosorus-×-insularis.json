    "intro": "Cyclosorus \u00d7 insularis, commonly known as the island water clover, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It features delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, clover-like lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the substrate, while its stems can spread horizontally to form dense mats. Cyclosorus \u00d7 insularis plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
