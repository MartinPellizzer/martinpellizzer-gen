    "intro": "Cycnoches cooperi var. villenae, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and elegant orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rocky slopes or in shaded forest areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to anchor itself securely in its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
