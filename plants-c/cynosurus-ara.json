    "intro": "Cynosurus ara, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Cynosurus ara is valued for its ecological role in supporting insect populations and its use in ecological restoration projects."
