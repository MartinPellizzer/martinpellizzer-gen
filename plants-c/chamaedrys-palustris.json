    "intro": "Chamaedrys palustris, commonly known as the marsh cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, typically in clusters of five, which give it its common name. Its leaves are alternate, palmately divided into five lobes, and are usually covered in fine hairs. Chamaedrys palustris thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
