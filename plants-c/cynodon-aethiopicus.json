    "intro": "Cynodon aethiopicus, commonly known as African lawngrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense growth habit, making it highly adaptable to various soil types. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to white flowers. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, which contributes to its widespread use in landscaping and erosion control. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, forming a dense sod that is difficult to eradicate."
