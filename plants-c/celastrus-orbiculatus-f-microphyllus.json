    "intro": "Celastrus orbiculatus f. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leafed bindweed, is a variant of the common bindweed. It is a deciduous climbing vine characterized by its small, ovate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it an invasive species in some regions, impacting native plant communities."
