    "intro": "Cirsium dipsacolepis var. dipsacolepis, commonly known as the narrowleaf thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a robust root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, hair-like structures that provide some protection against herbivores."
