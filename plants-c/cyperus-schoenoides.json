    "intro": "Cyperus schoenoides, commonly known as slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Cyperus schoenoides is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils and its decorative foliage."
