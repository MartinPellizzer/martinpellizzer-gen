    "intro": "Conospermum nervosum var. ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaved bottlebrush, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It features distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from red to orange, which appear during the warmer months. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a leathery texture, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
