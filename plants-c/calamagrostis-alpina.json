    "intro": "Calamagrostis alpina, commonly known as Alpine sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that turns coppery in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with feathery, light-colored bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements. Calamagrostis alpina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
