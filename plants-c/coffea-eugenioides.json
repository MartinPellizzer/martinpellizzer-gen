    "intro": "Coffea eugenioides, commonly known as the wild coffee or African coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds used for coffee production. It is often cultivated as a shade plant in coffee farms due to its ability to thrive in partial sunlight. Botanically, it is characterized by its simple leaves, small white flowers, and its role in the genetic diversity of cultivated coffee species."
