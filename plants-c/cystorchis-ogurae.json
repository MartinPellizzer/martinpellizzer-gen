    "intro": "Cystorchis ogurae, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on decaying wood in humid, shaded environments, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its small, strap-like leaves are adapted to conserve moisture, and it produces a distinctive, elongated seed pod. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, Cystorchis ogurae is considered a vulnerable species."
