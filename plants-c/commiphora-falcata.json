    "intro": "Commiphora falcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved myrrh, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and produces a fragrant resin that has been historically used in incense and traditional medicine. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Its resin, known as myrrh, is collected by making incisions in the bark, allowing the sap to exude and harden. Commiphora falcata is part of the Burseraceae family, which includes other resin-producing plants like frankincense."
