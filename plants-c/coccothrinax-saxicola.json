    "intro": "Coccothrinax saxicola, commonly known as the rock palm, is a small, slow-growing palm native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its clustered, short stems and pinnate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces dark, round fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
