    "intro": "Camellia muricatula, commonly known as the rough-leaved camellia, is a species native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in small, raised bumps, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces fragrant, camellia-like flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers partial shade to full sun. Camellia muricatula is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a decorative plant in traditional Chinese horticulture."
