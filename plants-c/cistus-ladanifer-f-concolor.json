    "intro": "Cistus ladanifer f. concolor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a flowering shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, glandular leaves that release a distinctive resinous scent. The plant produces clusters of pink to reddish-pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
