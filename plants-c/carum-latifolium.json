    "intro": "Carum latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf caraway, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its fruits are crescent-shaped seeds, similar to those of other caraway species, and are used in traditional medicine. Carum latifolium is valued for its essential oils, which have been used for their antispasmodic and digestive properties."
