    "intro": "Cousinia becquereli, commonly known as the Afghan stonecrop, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Cousinia becquereli is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in low-nutrient, well-drained conditions."
