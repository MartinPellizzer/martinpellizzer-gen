    "intro": "Cyanotis lanata var. sublanata, commonly known as the woolly bluebell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fibrous roots and rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
