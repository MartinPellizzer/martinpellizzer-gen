    "intro": "Citrullus vulgaris var. fistulosus, commonly known as the horned melon, is a unique variant of the cucumber family. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, green rind that resembles a hornet's nest. The plant produces large, round fruits with a thick, waxy skin and a sweet, juicy interior filled with edible seeds. Botanically, it is a herbaceous vine that thrives in warm, tropical climates. Its flowers are typically yellow with five petals and are pollinated by insects, leading to the development of its characteristic fruit."
