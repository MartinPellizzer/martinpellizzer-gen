It produces small, oval, dark red to black fruits that are highly prized for their sweet flavor and juiciness. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape with serrated edges. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The flowers are white and appear in clusters, typically before the leaves emerge in spring."
