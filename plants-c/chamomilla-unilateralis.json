    "intro": "Chamomilla unilateralis, commonly known as the one-sided chamomile, is a rare and unique species of flowering plant. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive one-sided inflorescence, which sets it apart from other chamomile varieties. The plant typically grows in specific microhabitats, such as rocky soils or shaded areas, and is found in limited regions of southern Africa. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and contain both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Chamomilla unilateralis is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
