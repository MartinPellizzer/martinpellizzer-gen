    "intro": "Clidemia glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in forest understories. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually smooth and glossy, with a dark green color. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Clidemia glabrata relies on host trees for water and nutrients, while also providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
