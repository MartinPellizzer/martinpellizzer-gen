It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths.

It plays an important ecological role in its habitat and is considered a keystone species in certain ecosystems."
