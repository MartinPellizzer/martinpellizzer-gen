    "intro": "Cassia pruinosa, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a fine, waxy coating that gives the plant its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pods containing flat, brown seeds. Cassia pruinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun for optimal growth."
