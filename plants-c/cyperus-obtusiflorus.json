    "intro": "Cyperus obtusiflorus, commonly known as the broadflower sedgeland, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, pale flowers. Cyperus obtusiflorus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wetland organisms."
