    "intro": "Caroxylon contrariifolium, commonly known as the opposite-leafed caroxylon, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Amborellaceae. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are typically drupes. It is found in specific wetland habitats in New Caledonia, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its unique evolutionary traits, it is considered a living fossil and holds significant value in botanical research."
