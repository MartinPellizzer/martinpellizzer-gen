    "intro": "Cereus markgrafii, commonly known as the night bloomer or moon cactus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Cereus markgrafii is popular in horticulture for its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
