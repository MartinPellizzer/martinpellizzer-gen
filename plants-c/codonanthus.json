These plants are characterized by their rosettes of fleshy, often hairy leaves and their showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Codonanthus species are typically evergreen and thrive in well-drained soil with moderate sunlight. They are popular as houseplants due to their attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements. The genus includes over 60 species, many of which are cultivated for their ornamental value."
