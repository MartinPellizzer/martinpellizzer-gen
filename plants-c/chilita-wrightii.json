    "intro": "Chilita wrightii, commonly known as Wright's chilita, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Chilita wrightii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
