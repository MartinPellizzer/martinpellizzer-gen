    "intro": "Castilleja halophila, commonly known as saltbush castilleja, is a hemiparasitic plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on root connections to host plants for water and nutrients. It thrives in saline soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Castilleja halophila plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity in its habitat."
