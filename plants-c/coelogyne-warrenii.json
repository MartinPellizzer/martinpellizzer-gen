    "intro": "Coelogyne warrenii, commonly known as the Warren's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and long, arching inflorescences that bear fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of white to cream-colored blooms with a subtle fragrance, often appearing in late winter to early spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Coelogyne warrenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and ease of care."
