    "intro": "Crotalaria bagamoyoensis, commonly known as the Bagamoyo cowpea, is a flowering plant native to East Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and palmately lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable for soil enrichment. However, it can be toxic to livestock due to the presence of pyrrolizidine alkaloids."
