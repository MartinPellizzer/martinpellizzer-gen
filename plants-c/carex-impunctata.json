    "intro": "Carex impunctata, commonly known as the smooth sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Carex impunctata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
