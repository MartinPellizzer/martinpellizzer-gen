    "intro": "Calea holtonii, commonly known as the \"flower of the night,\" is a striking plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its large, white, velvety petals that open at night and close during the day. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. Its unique nocturnal blooming behavior is triggered by changes in light and temperature. Calea holtonii is also noted for its aromatic leaves, which are often used in traditional Mexican medicine."
