    "intro": "Centaurea procumbens, commonly known as creeping centaury, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces clusters of bright blue to purple flowers, which are surrounded by pale yellow ray florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Centaurea procumbens is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun."
