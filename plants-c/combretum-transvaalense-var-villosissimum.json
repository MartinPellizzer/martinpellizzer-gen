    "intro": "Combretum transvaalense var. villosissimum, commonly known as the velvet bush willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its grayish-brown, rough bark and elongated, narrow leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The velvet bush willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
