    "intro": "Clidemia aphanantha, commonly known as the creeping waxplant, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species with showy flowers and aromatic leaves. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. Its small, white to pinkish flowers are borne in clusters and are often accompanied by glandular hairs on the foliage. Clidemia aphanantha is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
