    "intro": "Cochranea ericoidea, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant red or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, oval leaves are arranged in opposite pairs, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Cochranea ericoidea is adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
