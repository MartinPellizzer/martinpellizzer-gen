    "intro": "Cyrtandromoea repens, commonly known as the creeping cyrtandromoea, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color, with five petals arranged in a bell shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the botanical world."
