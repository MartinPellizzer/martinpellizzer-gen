    "intro": "Chrysobalanus icaco var. macrocarpus, commonly known as the large-fruited chrysobalanus, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers followed by large, fleshy, orange-red fruits that are edible. Its seeds are enclosed in a thick, sticky aril, which aids in seed dispersal by animals. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
