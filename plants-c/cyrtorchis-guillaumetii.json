    "intro": "Cyrtorchis guillaumetii, commonly known as the Guillaumet's cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the specific climate of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
