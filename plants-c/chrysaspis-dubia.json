    "intro": "Chrysaspis dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often difficult to spot due to their delicate and camouflaged appearance. It thrives in high humidity and requires specific conditions to flourish, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, Chrysaspis dubia is considered endangered in many regions."
