    "intro": "Camissonia scapoidea subsp. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-seed camissonia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in dry, rocky environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter fruiting structures compared to other subspecies within the species."
