    "intro": "Coronaria coronaria, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are compound, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. Coronaria coronaria is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
