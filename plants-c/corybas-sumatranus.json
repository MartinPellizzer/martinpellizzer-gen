    "intro": "Corybas sumatranus, commonly known as the Sumatran helmet orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its striking, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically dark red or purple in color. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, which is often adorned with intricate patterns and a prominent lip. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Sumatra and Borneo, it thrives in moist, shaded forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
