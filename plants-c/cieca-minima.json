    "intro": "Cieca minima, commonly known as the dwarf cieca, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It features delicate, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or woodland settings. Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of alpine flora."
