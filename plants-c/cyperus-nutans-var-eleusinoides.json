    "intro": "Cyperus nutans var. eleusinoides, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a compact cluster at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along water edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it both a common weed and an important component of wetland ecosystems."
