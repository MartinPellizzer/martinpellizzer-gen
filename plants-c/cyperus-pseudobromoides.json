    "intro": "Cyperus pseudobromoides, commonly known as the false bromegrass, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is native to Africa and has been introduced to other regions where it can thrive in similar habitats."
