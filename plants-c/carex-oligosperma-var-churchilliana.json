It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as tundra, wet meadows, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. Its rhizomes are often used for stabilizing soil in fragile ecosystems. The species is notable for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
