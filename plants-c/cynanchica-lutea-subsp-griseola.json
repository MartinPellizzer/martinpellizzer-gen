    "intro": "Cynanchica lutea subsp. griseola, commonly known as the grayleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and desert habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
