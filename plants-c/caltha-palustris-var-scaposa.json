    "intro": "Caltha palustris var. scaposa, commonly known as the slender marsh marigold, is a variant of the marsh marigold native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist to wet soils, often near streams or in marshy areas. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of hairs. This variant is distinguished by its slender, upright stems and is often found in open, sunny wetlands."
