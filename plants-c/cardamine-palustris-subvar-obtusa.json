    "intro": "Cardamine palustris subvar. obtusa, commonly known as broadleaf water-cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It typically grows in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats where it can access the moisture it requires. The plant features alternate, pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring, followed by heart-shaped, edible seeds. This variety is closely related to other members of the Ranunculaceae family and is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses."
