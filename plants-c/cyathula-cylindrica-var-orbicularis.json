    "intro": "Cyathula cylindrica var. orbicularis, commonly known as the round-leaved spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of East Asia. It features smooth, waxy leaves that are orbicular in shape, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique inflorescence typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its stems are usually erect and can become somewhat succulent, especially under stress. It is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks."
