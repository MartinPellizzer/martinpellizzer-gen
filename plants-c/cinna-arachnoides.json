It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, often reddish stems and trifoliate or pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic properties.
