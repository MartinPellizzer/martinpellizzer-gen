    "intro": "Coleus aconitiflorus, commonly known as the black nightshade coleus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its striking, dark purple to black flowers that contrast with its green foliage. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds, typical of the Solanaceae family, though it is not closely related to true nightshades. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
