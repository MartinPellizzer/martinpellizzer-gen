    "intro": "Cynanchum linifolium, commonly known as slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has smooth, linear leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain toxic, sticky seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically used in traditional medicine or horticulture."
