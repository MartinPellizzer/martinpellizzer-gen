    "intro": "Cremocephalum, commonly known as the \"yellow ironweed,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and bright yellow to orange inflorescences. The plants typically have finely divided, fern-like leaves and are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Cremocephalum species are often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
