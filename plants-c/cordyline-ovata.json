    "intro": "Cordyline ovata, commonly known as the mountain cabbage tree, is a striking tropical plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional M\u0101ori medicine and as a food source. Cordyline ovata is well adapted to coastal and mountainous environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
