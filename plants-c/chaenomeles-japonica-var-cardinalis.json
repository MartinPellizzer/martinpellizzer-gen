    "intro": "Chaenomeles japonica var. cardinalis, commonly known as the cardinal flowering quince, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its thick, aromatic bark and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellow, edible fruits in the fall, though they are often used for ornamental purposes rather than consumption. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant flowers and distinctive foliage, which add color and texture to the landscape."
