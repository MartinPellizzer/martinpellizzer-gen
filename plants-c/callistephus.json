    "intro": "Callistephus, commonly known as the Chinese aster, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to East Asia, particularly China, and are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers. They typically grow to a height of 30 to 120 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves and vibrant blooms in shades of red, pink, and white. Callistephus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. The flowers are composed of ray florets and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family, and they attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
