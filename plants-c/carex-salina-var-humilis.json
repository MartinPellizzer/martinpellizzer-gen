    "intro": "Carex salina var. humilis, commonly known as salt marsh sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal wetlands. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. It produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in early summer. This variant is adapted to withstand periodic flooding and high salt concentrations, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
