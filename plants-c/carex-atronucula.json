    "intro": "Carex atronucula, commonly known as the black-nut sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and small, clustered brownish flowers that appear in late summer. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Carex atronucula is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
