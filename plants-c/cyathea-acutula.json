    "intro": "Cyathea acutula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of long, narrow, leathery fronds. The plant has a robust rhizome system that supports its tall stature and allows it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, though this trait is more pronounced in certain species within the same genus. Cyathea acutula plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various organisms."
