It is characterized by its striking red stems that become prominent in the winter, contrasting with its showy white or pink bracts in the spring. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into red berries, which are a food source for birds. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a glossy green upper surface. Cornus longipedunculata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
