It features erect, branching stems that are hairy and often reddish in color. The plant produces showy, pink to purple composite flowers arranged in panicle-like inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.
