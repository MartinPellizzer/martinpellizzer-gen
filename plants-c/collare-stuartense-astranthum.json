    "intro": "Collare-stuartense astranthum, commonly known as the Stuart's collar aster, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
