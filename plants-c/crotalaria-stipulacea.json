    "intro": "Crotalaria stipulacea, commonly known as the slender crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features palmate leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in raceme clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through mechanical means. Crotalaria stipulacea is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
