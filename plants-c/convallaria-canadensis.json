    "intro": "Convallaria canadensis, commonly known as Canadian lily or white spider lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its attractive, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The bulbs of Convallaria canadensis are toxic and contain cardiac glycosides, making it important to handle with care."
