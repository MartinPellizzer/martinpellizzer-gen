It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant features slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats.
