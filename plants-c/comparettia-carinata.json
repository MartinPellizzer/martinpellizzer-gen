    "intro": "Comparettia carinata, commonly known as the spurred orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, spurred flowers that attract specific pollinators. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. The flowers, which can be white, yellow, or green, often have a strong scent to aid in pollination."
