    "intro": "Cuspidaria schumanniana, commonly known as the Schumann's cusk-fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds with a distinctive, narrow, and pointed shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
