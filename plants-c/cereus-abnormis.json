    "intro": "Cereus abnormis, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive appearance, featuring a swollen, colorful body known as the \"pseudostem.\" The plant produces showy, night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pink. It is a symbiotic species, often grafted onto a rootstock of another cactus species, such as Hylocereus. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering, it is a popular ornamental plant in warm climates."
