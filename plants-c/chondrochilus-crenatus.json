    "intro": "Chondrochilus crenatus, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andes region of South America. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or forested areas. The plant features a short, stocky rhizome with a single, upright stem that bears several lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and often have a faint fragrance, typical of many orchid species. Chondrochilus crenatus is known for its resilience to harsh mountain conditions and is often found in moist, shaded habitats."
