    "intro": "Cyrtochilum pavonii, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and its striking, velvety purple or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its native habitat. Cyrtochilum pavonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
