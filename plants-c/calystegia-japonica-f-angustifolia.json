    "intro": "Calystegia japonica f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Convolvulaceae. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pale yellow or white, blooming in summer. It is native to East Asia and is often found in moist, open habitats such as riverbanks and meadows. Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in some regions, making it a plant of both ornamental and ecological interest."
