    "intro": "Cynanchum crispiflorum, commonly known as the crinkled-flower milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes other milkweeds known for their milky sap. The plant features slender, ascending stems with opposite, ovate leaves that have a distinctive crinkled or wavy margin. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and are typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. Cynanchum crispiflorum is often found in moist, open woods and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
