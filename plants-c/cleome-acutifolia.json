It is characterized by its branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, often with serrated edges, and the plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.
