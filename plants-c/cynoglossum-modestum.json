It features hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and can be found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Cynoglossum modestum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
