    "intro": "Clinopodium ericifolium, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of the Americas and Europe. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces tiny, red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and rocky areas. Clinopodium ericifolium is also known for its aromatic leaves, which have been used in traditional herbal remedies."
