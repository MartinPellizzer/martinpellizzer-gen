    "intro": "Corybas albipurpureus, commonly known as the purple-white hooded orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, hood-like floral structure that encloses the reproductive organs, a feature typical of the genus Corybas. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a white and purple-pink coloration, which is often covered in a velvety texture. It is native to the wet tropical forests of New Guinea and is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
