    "intro": "Clinopodium canum, commonly known as rough hedge-nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves with serrated edges, and small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or pink in color. The plant produces small, four-lobed fruits called schizocarps, which release tiny seeds when mature. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands, thriving in moist to dry conditions. Clinopodium canum is notable for its aromatic leaves, which contain essential oils and are sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
