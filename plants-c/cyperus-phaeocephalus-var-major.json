    "intro": "Cyperus phaeocephalus var. major, commonly known as the dark-headed flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically brown or purplish in color. The plant thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and establish dense stands. Its botanical characteristics make it a common species in wetland ecosystems and a potential indicator of waterlogged soils."
