    "intro": "Carpinus betulus f. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hornbeam, is a variant of the common hornbeam. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically serrated along the edges. This plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shady woodlands. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by small, edible berries in the fall. The bark is smooth and pale, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
