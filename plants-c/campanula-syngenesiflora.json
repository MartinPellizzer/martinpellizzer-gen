    "intro": "Campanula syngenesiflora, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Campanula syngenesiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
