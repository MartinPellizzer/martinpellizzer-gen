    "intro": "Cornus florida var. urbiniana, commonly known as the Urbiniana dogwood, is a striking variant of the flowering dogwood native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, white bracts that surround small, yellowish flowers, which appear in early spring. The plant produces bright red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
