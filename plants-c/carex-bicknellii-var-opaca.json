    "intro": "Carex bicknellii var. opaca, commonly known as the Bicknell's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils in forested areas, often found in bogs or wetlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the summer. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects. This variety is distinguished by its dense, compact form and is relatively low maintenance once established."
