    "intro": "Callitriche verna var. fissa, commonly known as spring water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has tiny, star-shaped leaves that are usually submerged, with delicate, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its stems are often floating or partially submerged, and it produces small, elongated fruits that disperse by water. This species is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed aquatic habitats."
