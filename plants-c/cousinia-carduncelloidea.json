    "intro": "Cousinia carduncelloidea, commonly known as the woolly globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often edible roots. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Cousinia carduncelloidea is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability."
