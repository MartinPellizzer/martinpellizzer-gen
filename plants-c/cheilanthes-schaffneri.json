    "intro": "Cheilanthes schaffneri, commonly known as the Schaffner's rockcap, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with tightly clustered, linear leaves that are usually green to gray-green in color. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and are covered by a protective indusium. This species is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native habitat."
