    "intro": "Cyperus longus var. tenuiflorus, commonly known as slender-flowered flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
