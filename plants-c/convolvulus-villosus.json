    "intro": "Convolvulus villosus, commonly known as hairy bindweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial vine characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in gardens and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in cultivated areas."
