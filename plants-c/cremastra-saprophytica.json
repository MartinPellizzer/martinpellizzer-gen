    "intro": "Cremastra saprophytica, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in pine rockland habitats. The plant lacks leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, which are covered in a white, spongy tissue. Its flowers are pale green or white, with a distinctive three-lobed lip, and bloom in late spring. Due to habitat loss and its specific ecological requirements, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
