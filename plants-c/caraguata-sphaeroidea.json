    "intro": "Caraguata sphaeroidea, commonly known as the globe tree, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique spherical shape, with a dense cluster of leaves forming a ball-like structure. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
