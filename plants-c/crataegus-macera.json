    "intro": "Crataegus macera, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are edible but often used in jams and wines. Crataegus macera is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting wildlife, including birds and insects. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
