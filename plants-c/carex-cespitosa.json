    "intro": "Carex cespitosa, commonly known as tussock sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms dense clumps or tussocks, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex cespitosa thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks."
