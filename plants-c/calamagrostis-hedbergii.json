    "intro": "Calamagrostis hedbergii, commonly known as Hedberg's reed, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate silver-green hue to the landscape. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and alpine environments. Hedberg's reed is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
