    "intro": "Columbia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean columbia, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its striking, large, and colorful flowers that bloom in the late spring and early summer. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves and a woody stem, which help it thrive in the humid and shaded undergrowth of its natural habitat. It is typically found in lowland and hill forest areas, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
