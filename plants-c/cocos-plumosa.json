    "intro": "Cocos plumosa, commonly known as the plumose coconut, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that eventually develop into coconut-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material. Cocos plumosa thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils."
