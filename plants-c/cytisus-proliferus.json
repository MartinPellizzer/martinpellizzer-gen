It is characterized by its bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically green and hairy. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun. Cytisus proliferus is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
