    "intro": "Castilleja pallescens, commonly known as the pale stork's-bill, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a slender, erect stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. Castilleja pallescens is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
