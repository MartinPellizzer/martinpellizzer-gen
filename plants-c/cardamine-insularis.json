    "intro": "Cardamine insularis, commonly known as the island buttercup, is a small flowering plant native to the British Isles. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, greenish fruits. Due to habitat loss, Cardamine insularis is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
