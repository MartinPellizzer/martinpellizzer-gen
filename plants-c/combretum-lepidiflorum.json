    "intro": "Combretum lepidiflorum, commonly known as the velvetwood or silverleaf combretum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in summer. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-resistant and suitable for xeriscaping. The leaves and bark have been used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
