    "intro": "Carex schiedeana, commonly known as the Schiede's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, cylindrical leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, often found in wetlands and forest understories. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
