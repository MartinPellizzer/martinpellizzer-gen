    "intro": "Carex exsiccata, commonly known as the dryland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry soils, often in rocky or sandy habitats, and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikes and are pollinated by wind. Carex exsiccata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
