    "intro": "Cypripedium javanicum, commonly known as the Java lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a unique feature among orchids. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in many countries."
