    "intro": "Cordyline guilfoylei, commonly known as the Lord Howe Island cordyline, is a striking evergreen plant native to the isolated Lord Howe Island in the South Pacific. It features tall, slender stems with broad, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often marked with distinctive white or silver veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, followed by red berries that are a key part of its reproductive cycle. Due to its limited habitat and threats from invasive species, it is classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a notable species in the Cordylinae subfamily."
