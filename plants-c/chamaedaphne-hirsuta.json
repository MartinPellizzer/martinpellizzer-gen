    "intro": "Chamaedaphne hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy leatherleaf, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its small, dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for various bird species. It thrives in acidic, waterlogged soils and is often found in bogs and swamps. Chamaedaphne hirsuta plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
