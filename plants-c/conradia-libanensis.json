    "intro": "Conradia libanensis, commonly known as the Lebanon cedar, is a coniferous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts."
