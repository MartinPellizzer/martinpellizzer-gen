    "intro": "Calliandra, commonly known as the coral tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from red to pink and yellow. The plant has feathery, bipinnate leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. Calliandra species are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them beneficial in agricultural settings. Some species are used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
