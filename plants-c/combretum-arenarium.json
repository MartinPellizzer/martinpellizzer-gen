    "intro": "Combretum arenarium, commonly known as sand combretum, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom during the rainy season. Its woody stems are often branched and can form dense thickets, providing habitat for various small animals. Combretum arenarium is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought, making it a hardy plant in challenging environments."
