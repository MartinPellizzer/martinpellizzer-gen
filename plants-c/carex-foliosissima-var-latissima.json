    "intro": "Carex foliosissima var. latissima, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are broader than typical sedges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity."
