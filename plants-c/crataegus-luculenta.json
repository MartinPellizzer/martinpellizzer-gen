    "intro": "Crataegus luculenta, commonly known as the sweetthorn or European hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often tart, and they serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus luculenta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential cardiovascular benefits. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a slightly serrated margin."
