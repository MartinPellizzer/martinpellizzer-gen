    "intro": "Clethra castaneifolia, commonly known as the sweet pepperbush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in cylindrical clusters during the summer months. These flowers are pollinated by insects and give way to small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Clethra castaneifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils."
