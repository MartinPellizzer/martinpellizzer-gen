    "intro": "Cirsium perennans, commonly known as the perennial thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and spiny leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are covered in sharp, prickly hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The flowers, which bloom in late summer, are usually purple or pink and attract various pollinators."
