    "intro": "Cyperus exaltatus var. tenuispicatus, commonly known as the narrow-bracted flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a cylindrical stem that can grow up to several feet in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, ditches, and along waterways. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites make it both a useful indicator plant and a potential weed in aquatic habitats."
