It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, opposite leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance. Its name derives from the presence of ants on its trunk, which contribute to its natural defense mechanisms."
