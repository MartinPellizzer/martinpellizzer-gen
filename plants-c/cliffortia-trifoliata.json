    "intro": "Cliffortia trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved starling or the white starling, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. Its small, white flowers are borne in clusters and bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cliffortia trifoliata is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
