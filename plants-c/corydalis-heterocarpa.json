It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of delicate, pinkish-purple flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the genus Corydalis. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique floral structure, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
