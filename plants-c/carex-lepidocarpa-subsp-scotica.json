    "intro": "Carex lepidocarpa subsp. scotica, commonly known as Scottish sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, triangular spikes of greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The subspecies scotica is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and geographic distribution compared to the broader species."
