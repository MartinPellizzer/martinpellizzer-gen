    "intro": "Cotoneaster lanatus, commonly known as the woolly cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Cotoneaster lanatus is relatively drought-tolerant and can adapt to a variety of environmental conditions."
