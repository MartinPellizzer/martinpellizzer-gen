    "intro": "Cyperus calcaratus, commonly known as the sand spiker or spike rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Cyperus calcaratus is known for its ability to thrive in saline or brackish environments, making it a hardy and adaptable species."
