    "intro": "Cercis chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese redbud, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. The plant produces small, flat pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Cercis chinensis is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
