It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. Cyclosorus aoristisorus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
