    "intro": "Cupaniopsis dallachyi, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically borne in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to dry environments, with thick leaves and a shallow root system to conserve water. Cupaniopsis dallachyi is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
