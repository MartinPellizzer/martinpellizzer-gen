    "intro": "[WRONG START] Citrullus vulgarus var. jacaeus, commonly known as the African horned cucumber, is a unique variant of the bottle gourd. It is characterized by its elongated, spiky fruit that resembles a horn, with a pale green skin covered in small, sharp tubercles. The plant is native to Africa and thrives in warm, tropical climates. Its fruit is typically harvested when immature, as it becomes fibrous and bitter when fully mature. It is cultivated for both ornamental purposes and as a vegetable in some regions."
