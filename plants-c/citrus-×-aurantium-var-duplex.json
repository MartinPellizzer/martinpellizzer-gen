    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 aurantium var. duplex, commonly known as the double orange, is a hybrid citrus plant characterized by its unique floral structure. It features two sets of flowers on each inflorescence, one set of regular flowers and another set of sterile, showy flowers. This botanical trait is a result of natural or artificial hybridization between different citrus species. The plant typically produces small, round fruits with a thick, aromatic peel. It is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of fragrant essential oils."
