    "intro": "Cardiobatus nivalis, commonly known as the snow heart plant, is a rare alpine species characterized by its unique heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in high-altitude environments with low temperatures and limited sunlight. The plant's foliage is covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs that help insulate it from the cold. Its flowers, which bloom in early summer, are small and pale pink, often hidden among the foliage. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
