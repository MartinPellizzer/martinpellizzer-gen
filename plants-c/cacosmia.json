    "intro": "Cacosmia, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are characterized by their large, showy flowers that often resemble lotus flowers, though they are not related to the true lotus. Cacosmia species typically grow in wet, swampy areas and have distinctive, palmately lobed leaves. The flowers are usually pink or red, with a central yellow stamen that is highly visible and attractive to pollinators."
