It features small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care in indoor settings."
