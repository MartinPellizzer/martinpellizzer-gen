    "intro": "Carex macrostigmatica, commonly known as the broad-stigma sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. Native to regions of Europe and Asia, it typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy, and its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
