    "intro": "Cycas spiniformis, commonly known as the spiny cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa and Namibia. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a fibrous, scaly bark. Its leaves are pinnate, with long, stiff, spiny leaflets that give it its characteristic appearance. Cycas spiniformis is a slow-growing, ancient plant that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
