    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 media var. intermixta, commonly known as the hybrid hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny branches, lobed leaves, and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red to orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. Botanically, it is a natural hybrid between Crataegus monogyna and Crataegus crus-galli."
