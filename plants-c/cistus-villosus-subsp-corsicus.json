    "intro": "Cistus villosus subsp. corsicus, commonly known as the Corsican rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to sunny, arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping."
