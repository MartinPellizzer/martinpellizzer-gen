    "intro": "Capriola, commonly known as the common tansy, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and is often found in moist meadows and along streambanks. Capriola is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution in handling."
