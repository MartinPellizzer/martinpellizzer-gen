    "intro": "Cardiospermum oliveirae, commonly known as the Brazilian morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Convolvulaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to reveal bright orange seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found growing along riverbanks and in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it both a popular garden plant and an invasive species in some regions."
