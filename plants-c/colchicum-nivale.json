    "intro": "Colchicum nivale, commonly known as the snow colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It produces striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the snow has fully melted. The plant has fleshy, basal leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is part of the Colchicaceae family, known for its association with the toxic alkaloid colchicine. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to cold, harsh environments."
