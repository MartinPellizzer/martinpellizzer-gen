    "intro": "Cerasus microcarpa var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy dwarf cherry, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, dark red to black fruits that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, with a tart flavor. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, often with a pointed tip. It produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, preceding the foliage. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its compact size and seasonal interest."
