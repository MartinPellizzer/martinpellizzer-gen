It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that have a distinctive zigzag pattern along their edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The botanical features of Chytroma crenata make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
