    "intro": "Celsia acanthifolia, commonly known as the spiny celsia, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and dense, spiny foliage, which provides protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically elliptical with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Celsia acanthifolia is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
