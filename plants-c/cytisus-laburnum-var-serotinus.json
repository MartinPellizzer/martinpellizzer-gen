    "intro": "Cytisus laburnum var. serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering laburnum, is a variant of the common laburnum that exhibits delayed blooming. It is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe, characterized by its slender, arching branches and clusters of bright yellow pea-shaped flowers. The leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, oval leaflets, and the plant produces elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. This variety is particularly valued for its late summer flowering, which adds color to gardens after the typical spring bloom of other plants."
