It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface, and its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, often displaying shades of white or pale pink. Cunuria australis has a fibrous root system and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich soils. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
