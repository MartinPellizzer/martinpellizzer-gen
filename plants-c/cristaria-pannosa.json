    "intro": "Cristaria pannosa, commonly known as the woolly star, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or grayish hairs covering its stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly rough texture. Cristaria pannosa thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands."
