    "intro": "Castilleja affinis var. minor, commonly known as the smallleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid red-orange bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
