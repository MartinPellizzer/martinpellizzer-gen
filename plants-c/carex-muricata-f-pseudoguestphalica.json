    "intro": "Carex muricata f. pseudoguestphalica, commonly known as the spiked sedge, is a variant of the common sedge species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a distinctive rough, textured surface. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wetland environments."
