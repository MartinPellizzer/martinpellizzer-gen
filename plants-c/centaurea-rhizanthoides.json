    "intro": "Centaurea rhizanthoides, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow to orange flower heads that resemble small stars, surrounded by spiny, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its growth habit is typically low and sprawling, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Centaurea rhizanthoides is also known for its ability to reseed itself readily, making it a persistent weed in disturbed areas."
