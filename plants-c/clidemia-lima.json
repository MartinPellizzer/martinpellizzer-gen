    "intro": "Clidemia lima, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false poinsettia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually dark green with a slightly velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by bright red bracts that are often mistaken for flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Clidemia lima is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it an invasive species in some regions."
