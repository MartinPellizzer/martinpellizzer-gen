    "intro": "Calceolaria nivalis, commonly known as the snow calceolaria, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions. It has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat. Calceolaria nivalis is a perennial species that blooms in the spring and early summer."
