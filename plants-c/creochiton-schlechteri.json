    "intro": "Creochiton schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's woodlouse, is a species of isopod belonging to the family Porcellanidae. It is characterized by its segmented, flattened body covered in a calcareous exoskeleton, which provides protection against predators and desiccation. This species is typically found in moist, rocky habitats, such as under stones or in damp soil, where it thrives in humid environments. Its diet primarily consists of decaying plant matter, contributing to nutrient cycling in its ecosystem. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and less-studied species within its range."
