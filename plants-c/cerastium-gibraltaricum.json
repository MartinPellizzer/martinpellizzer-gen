    "intro": "Cerastium gibraltaricum, commonly known as Gibraltar mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula and northern Africa. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
