    "intro": "Ceterach capense, commonly known as the coastal cuttonplant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal areas, thriving in saline and well-drained soils. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer that helps reduce water loss. Ceterach capense is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
