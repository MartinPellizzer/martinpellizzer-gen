    "intro": "Cousinia glaucopsis var. glaucopsis, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early summer, arranged in dense, showy clusters atop sturdy stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its striking appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and ecological restoration projects."
