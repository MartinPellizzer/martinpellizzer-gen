    "intro": "Cuphea sessilifolia f. major, commonly known as the large-leaved cuphea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular red or pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features broad, ovate leaves with a glossy surface, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This cultivar is popular in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees."
