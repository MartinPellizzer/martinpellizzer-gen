    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris f. hiemalis, commonly known as the winter heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to western Europe. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, typically from late autumn into early spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments. Its foliage remains green throughout the year, providing ornamental value even when it is not in bloom. This cultivar is valued for its hardiness and ability to add color to gardens during the colder months."
