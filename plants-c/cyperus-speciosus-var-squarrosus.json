    "intro": "Cyperus speciosus var. squarrosus, commonly known as the woolly flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves with a distinctive woolly texture on the lower surface, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
