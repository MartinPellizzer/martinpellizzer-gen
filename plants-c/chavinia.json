    "intro": "Chavinia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are characterized by their striking, spiky flowers that range in color from blue to purple. Chavinia species are often shrubs or subshrubs with silver-gray foliage that reflects the sun, aiding in water conservation. They are adapted to salty and windy environments, making them resilient to harsh coastal conditions. The flowers are often used in ornamental gardening due to their unique appearance and hardy nature."
