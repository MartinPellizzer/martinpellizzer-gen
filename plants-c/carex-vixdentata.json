The plant has grass-like leaves that are narrow and often have a slightly rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, three-ranked structures. Carex vixdentata plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
