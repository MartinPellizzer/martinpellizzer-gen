    "intro": "Ctenopteris micropaleata, commonly known as the small-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often submerged or partially submerged, allowing it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid environments."
