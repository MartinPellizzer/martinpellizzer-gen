    "intro": "Carlina maritima, commonly known as sea daisies, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in salty environments. Carlina maritima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in coastal landscaping."
