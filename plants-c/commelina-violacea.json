    "intro": "Commelina violacea, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in clusters, often surrounded by white bracts that resemble mist. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves with prominent veins, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in shaded forest understories. Commelina violacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
