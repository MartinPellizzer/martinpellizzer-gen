    "intro": "Coryphopteris meiobasis, commonly known as the small-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in low-light conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves, a common feature in many fern species. Coryphopteris meiobasis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
