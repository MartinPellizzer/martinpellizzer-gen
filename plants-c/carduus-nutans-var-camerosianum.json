It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has deeply lobed, silvery-green leaves with a rough texture and a distinctive white underside. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. The variety camerosianum is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and shorter flower stalks compared to the typical form."
