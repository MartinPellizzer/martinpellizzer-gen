    "intro": "Centaurea jacea subsp. substituta, commonly known as the lesser knapweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features upright, branching stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow to orange-red flower heads composed of numerous small florets. It blooms from late spring to early autumn, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. This subspecies is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
