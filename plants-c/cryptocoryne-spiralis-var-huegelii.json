    "intro": "Cryptocoryne spiralis var. huegelii, commonly known as the Hugel's spiral cryptocoryne, is a rare and highly sought-after aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spiral-shaped leaves that can grow up to 20 cm in length, with a deep green coloration and prominent midrib. The plant thrives in low to moderate light conditions and requires stable water parameters, making it a challenging yet rewarding species for advanced aquarists. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in planted tanks, where it contributes a lush, natural aesthetic. Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is less commonly available in the aquarium trade compared to other cryptocoryne species."
