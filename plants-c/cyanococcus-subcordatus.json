    "intro": "Cyanococcus subcordatus, commonly known as the dwarf sea holly, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features a compact, mat-forming growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that are often bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of blue and purple, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
