    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 macfarlanei, commonly known as the Macfarlane's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi that aid in nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pink or pale purple, with a contrasting yellow or green lip. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and study."
