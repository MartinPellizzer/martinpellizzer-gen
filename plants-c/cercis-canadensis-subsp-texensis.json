    "intro": "Cercis canadensis subsp. texensis, commonly known as the Texas redbud, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive papery bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers in early spring, which appear before the leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its compact size and ornamental features make it a valuable addition to gardens and natural habitats."
