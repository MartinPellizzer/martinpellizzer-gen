It is characterized by its distinctive reddish stems and leaves, which are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are encased in a fleshy, orange-red capsule. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. This species is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated areas."
