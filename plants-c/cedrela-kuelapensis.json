    "intro": "Cedrela kuelapensis, commonly known as the Kuelap cedar, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin, particularly in Peru and Ecuador. It belongs to the Meliaceae family, which includes mahogany and related species. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a dense canopy, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate. Its flowers are small and fragrant, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces woody fruits that contain flat, winged seeds. The wood of Cedrela kuelapensis is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, though it is also threatened by deforestation and habitat loss."
