    "intro": "Calomeria tenerrima, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that produces bright yellow flowers, which are typically clustered in a single head. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration. Calomeria tenerrima is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
