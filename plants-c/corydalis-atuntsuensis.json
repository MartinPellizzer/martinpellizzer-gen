    "intro": "Corydalis atuntsuensis, commonly known as the Korean flameflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northeastern Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats and has slender, creeping stems that produce numerous small, clustered flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its roots are tuberous and often used in traditional medicine. Corydalis atuntsuensis is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its potential pharmacological properties."
