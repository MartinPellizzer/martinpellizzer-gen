It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the sedge family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
