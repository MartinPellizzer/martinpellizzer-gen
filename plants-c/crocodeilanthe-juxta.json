    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe juxta, commonly known as the close-growing fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and finely divided, linear fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-draining soil. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its unique botanical profile. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Crocodeilanthe juxta is considered a specialty plant for advanced botanical enthusiasts."
