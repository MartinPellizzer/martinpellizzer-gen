    "intro": "Callistanthos pignalii, commonly known as the Pignalii mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant relies on host trees, such as the Canary Island pine, for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. Its fruits are small berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
