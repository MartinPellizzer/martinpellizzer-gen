    "intro": "Cousinia fetissowi, commonly known as the Persian cushion plant, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cousinia fetissowi is adapted to high altitudes and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
