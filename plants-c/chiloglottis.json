    "intro": "Chiloglottis, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their unique, hood-like floral structure that protects the reproductive organs. Chiloglottis species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, often in shaded, humid environments. Their flowers are typically small and greenish or yellowish, with a distinctive labellum that aids in pollination by specific insect species. The genus includes around 20 species, many of which are prized for their ornamental value and ecological significance in native ecosystems."
