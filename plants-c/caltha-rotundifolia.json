It features striking yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has rounded, waxy leaves that are typically clustered at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodlands, thriving in well-drained to moderately wet soils. Caltha rotundifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
