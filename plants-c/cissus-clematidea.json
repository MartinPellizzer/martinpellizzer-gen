    "intro": "Cissus clematidea, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, spherical fruits. It thrives in humid environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it both useful and sometimes invasive in certain regions."
