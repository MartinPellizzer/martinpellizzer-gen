    "intro": "Calyptranthes tricona, commonly known as the three-lobed calyptranthes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Calyptranthes tricona is often found in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
