    "intro": "Clermontia coerulea var. greenwelliana, commonly known as the Greenwell's bluebell, is a rare and striking plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vivid blue, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are elliptical and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is a symbol of Hawaii's unique botanical diversity."
