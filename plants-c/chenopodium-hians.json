    "intro": "Chenopodium hians, commonly known as the silverleaf goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray, hairy leaves that are often lobed or notched, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are encased in hard, triangular capsules. Chenopodium hians thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It is sometimes considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
