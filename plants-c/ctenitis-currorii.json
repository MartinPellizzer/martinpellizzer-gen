    "intro": "Ctenitis currorii, commonly known as the Curror's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Its rhizome is robust, supporting its height and enabling it to grow in nutrient-poor soils. Ctenitis currorii plays a significant role in the ecological structure of New Zealand's native forests."
