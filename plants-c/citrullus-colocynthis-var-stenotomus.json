    "intro": "Citrullus colocynthis var. stenotomus, commonly known as the bitter apple or colocynth, is a variant of the flowering plant native to the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rough, spiny fruit that resembles a small gourd, typically measuring up to 10 centimeters in length. The plant is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and melons, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruit contains a high concentration of bitter compounds, primarily cucurbitacin, which makes it unpalatable to most animals. Despite its bitterness, it has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural insecticide."
