    "intro": "Castilleja covilleana, commonly known as the Coville's paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its roots. The plant produces striking red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in its native ecosystem."
