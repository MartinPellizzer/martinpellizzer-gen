    "intro": "Cuscuta capensis, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow or orange flowers and has a vine-like structure that wraps around its host. The plant is native to Africa and has been introduced to other regions, including parts of the United States. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread to new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or kill its host plants, making it a concern in agricultural settings."
