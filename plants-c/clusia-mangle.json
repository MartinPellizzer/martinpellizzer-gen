    "intro": "Clusia mangle, commonly known as mangrove fig, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and northern South America. It is well adapted to saline environments and often grows in mangrove forests where it contributes to the ecological stability of these wetlands. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its salty habitat. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. The fruit is a fleshy, yellowish berry that contains numerous seeds, aiding in its propagation along coastal areas."
