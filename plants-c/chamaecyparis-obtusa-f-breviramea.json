    "intro": "Chamaecyparis obtusa f. breviramea, commonly known as the Japanese cedar dwarf form, is a compact variant of the Japanese cedar, characterized by its dense, conical shape and slow growth rate. It features scale-like leaves that are short and closely packed, giving it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a dark brown color, typical of the Cupressaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. Due to its unique form and hardiness, it is a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
