    "intro": "Carex straminea, commonly known as the yellow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Carex straminea thrives in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
