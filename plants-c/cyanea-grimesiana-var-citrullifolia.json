It is characterized by its vibrant yellow to orange flowers, which bloom throughout the year. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces fruit that resembles a small, round melon. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
