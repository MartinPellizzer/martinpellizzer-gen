    "intro": "Cardamine gemmifera, commonly known as the gemmiferous watercress, is a delicate flowering plant native to wet, calcareous habitats in Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in racemes. Its reproductive strategy involves self-fertilization, which is common among members of its family. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
