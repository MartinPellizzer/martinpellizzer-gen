    "intro": "Calyptrostylis longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked duck's bill, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and fleshy labellum that resembles a duck's bill, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as swampy areas and forest floors. It has a slender, upright stem with several ovate, dark green leaves. The flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in a spike, and bloom during the summer months."
