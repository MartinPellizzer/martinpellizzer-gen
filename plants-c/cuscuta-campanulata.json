    "intro": "Cuscuta campanulata, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is found in various regions, including North America and Europe, and typically infests crops and wild plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to spread easily. Despite its parasitic nature, Cuscuta campanulata plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant populations."
