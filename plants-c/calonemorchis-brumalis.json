    "intro": "Calonemorchis brumalis, commonly known as the winter orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its unique blooming period makes it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Calonemorchis brumalis is considered endangered in its natural range."
