    "intro": "Cayratia debilis, commonly known as the silver vine, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that often have a silvery or whitish underside. The plant produces tiny greenish-white flowers followed by small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Cayratia debilis is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to climb trellises or other structures. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
