    "intro": "Carex rorulenta, commonly known as the slender sedges, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its roots form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Carex rorulenta is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
