    "intro": "Carex bispicata, commonly known as the two-bracted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Carex bispicata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse ecosystems."
