It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and fluffy, silver-gray plumes that create a striking visual effect in gardens. The plant prefers moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds a soft texture to the landscape. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in challenging wet environments."
