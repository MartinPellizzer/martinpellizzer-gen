    "intro": "Chloroleucon mangense var. tetrazyx, commonly known as the four-colored mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive four-colored leaves, which range from green to red, yellow, and brown, depending on age and environmental conditions. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often forming dense mangrove forests that stabilize shorelines. Its roots are adapted to filter out salt, allowing it to survive in tidal zones. The species plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
