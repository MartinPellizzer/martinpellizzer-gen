It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
