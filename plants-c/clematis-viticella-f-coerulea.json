    "intro": "Clematis viticella f. coerulea, commonly known as the Azure Clematis, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to Europe. It features small, fragrant, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine, white pubescence. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and trellises. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vigorous growth and long flowering period."
