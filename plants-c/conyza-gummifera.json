    "intro": "Conyza gummifera, commonly known as sticky weed or gumweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and sticky, resinous secretions that cover its stems and leaves. The plant belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. Conyza gummifera typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in open areas such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environments, though it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
