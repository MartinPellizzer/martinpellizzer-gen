    "intro": "Cogswellia cottami, commonly known as the Cape York cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its robust, trunk-like stem and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with the male and female cones typically appearing on separate plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss. Its unique morphology and evolutionary history make it an important subject for botanical research."
