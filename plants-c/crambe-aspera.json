It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture.
