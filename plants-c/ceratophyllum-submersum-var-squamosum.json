    "intro": "Ceratophyllum submersum var. squamosum, commonly known as the spiked watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, floating flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions, impacting native plant communities."
