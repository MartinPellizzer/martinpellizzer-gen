    "intro": "Carex hirsuta, commonly known as hairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are hairy, particularly along the edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a dense, cylindrical inflorescence. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Carex hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing wetland soils."
