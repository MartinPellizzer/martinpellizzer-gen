    "intro": "Capnoides schelesnowiana, commonly known as the Schelesnow's capnoid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
