    "intro": "Crocus annulatus var. pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf crocus, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It produces delicate, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically blooming in early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and grows to a height of only a few centimeters, making it well-suited for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in dry, well-drained soils, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This variety is prized for its early bloom and low maintenance requirements."
