    "intro": "Coelogyne quadriloba, commonly known as the four-lobed orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow with red or orange markings. The plant produces a pseudobulb-like structure that stores water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its native habitat. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-shaped, growing from the base of the pseudobulb. Coelogyne quadriloba is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
