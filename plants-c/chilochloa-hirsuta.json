    "intro": "Chilochloa hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy chilochloa, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the fine hairs covering the surface. Chilochloa hirsuta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
