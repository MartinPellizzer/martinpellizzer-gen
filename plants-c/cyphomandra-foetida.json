    "intro": "Cyphomandra foetida, commonly known as the stinking nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. It is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are followed by yellow, egg-shaped fruits. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture and often have a mild, sometimes unpleasant odor. Due to its toxic properties, it is not edible and should be handled with care."
