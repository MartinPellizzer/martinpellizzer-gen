    "intro": "Crepidium torricellense, commonly known as the Torricella orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, terrestrial growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence, typically blooming in the spring. Its rhizome is fibrous, and it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
