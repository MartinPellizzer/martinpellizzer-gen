    "intro": "Corydalis ramosa var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf weeping corydalis, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features delicate, fern-like foliage and produces clusters of small, nodding flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically blooms in early spring and has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, and its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly over time. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in temperate climates."
