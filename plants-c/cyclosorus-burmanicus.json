    "intro": "Cyclosorus burmanicus, commonly known as the Burmese cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as rivers and ponds. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cyclosorus burmanicus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and small aquatic life."
