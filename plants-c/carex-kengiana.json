    "intro": "Carex kengiana, commonly known as the Keng's sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in wetland habitats. Carex kengiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in aquatic and riparian zones."
