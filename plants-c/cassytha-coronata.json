It features slender, wiry stems that twine around other plants, often forming dense mats. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are oval to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in spikes, typically appearing in late winter to early spring. Cassytha coronata is often found in wet or disturbed habitats, such as rainforests and creek sides."
