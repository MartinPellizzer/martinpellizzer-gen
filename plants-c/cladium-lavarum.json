    "intro": "Cladium lavarum, commonly known as the mangrove sedges, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. These plants are typically found in wetland and coastal environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Cladium lavarum is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and its ability to thrive in saline or brackish water conditions. The plant's rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in muddy or tidal areas. It plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity in mangrove and estuarine ecosystems."
