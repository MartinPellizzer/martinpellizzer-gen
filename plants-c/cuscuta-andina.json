    "intro": "Cuscuta andina, commonly known as the Andean dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It attaches to host plants using specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant is often found growing on crops such as beans and potatoes in South America. Its small, yellow flowers are inconspicuous and typically appear in clusters. Cuscuta andina is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to reduce crop yields."
