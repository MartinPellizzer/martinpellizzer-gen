    "intro": "Cnicus \u00d7 clarkei, commonly known as the hybrid sow thistle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cnicus benedictus and Cnicus pepo, two native species of the genus Cnicus. The plant typically features spiny, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and fields. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
