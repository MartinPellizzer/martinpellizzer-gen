    "intro": "Chlorospatha croatiana subsp. croatiana, commonly known as the Croatian green orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, which is typically lance-shaped and often covered in a dense, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, making it distinctive among orchids. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, humus-filled soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
