    "intro": "Cnicus ambiguus, commonly known as the common sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual herb that grows up to 60 cm tall, with a hairy stem and alternate, lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are often mistaken for those of other similar species due to their variable shape and size. Cnicus ambiguus is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields."
