    "intro": "Cuscuta strobilacea var. strobilacea, commonly known as the Indian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found growing on crops such as rice and millet. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily to new host plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
