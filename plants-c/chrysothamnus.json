These plants are native to North America, particularly the western United States and parts of Canada. They are characterized by their yellow flowers and woody, shrub-like growth habit. Chrysothamnus species often thrive in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Their ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
