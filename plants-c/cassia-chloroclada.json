    "intro": "Cassia chloroclada, commonly known as the golden cassia, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that mature into a reddish-brown color. Cassia chloroclada is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
