    "intro": "Carex tribuloides var. moniliformis, commonly known as the bearded sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive, bead-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
