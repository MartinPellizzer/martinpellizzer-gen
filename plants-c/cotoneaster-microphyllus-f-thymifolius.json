    "intro": "Cotoneaster microphyllus f. thymifolius, commonly known as the fragrant cotoneaster, is a compact shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that emit a subtle aromatic scent, especially when crushed. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are ornamental and attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
