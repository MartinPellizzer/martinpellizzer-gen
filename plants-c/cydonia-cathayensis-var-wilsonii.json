    "intro": "Cydonia cathayensis var. wilsonii, commonly known as the Chinese quince, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers in early spring, followed by yellow, pear-shaped fruits that ripen in late summer. The fruit is typically harvested when it turns a deep orange-red, and it is used in traditional Chinese medicine and culinary applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
