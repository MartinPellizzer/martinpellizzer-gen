    "intro": "Clermontia samuelii subsp. samuelii, commonly known as Samuel's hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and streamside areas. It has simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, this subspecies is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
