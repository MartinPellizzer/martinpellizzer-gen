    "intro": "Ceropteris pallescens, commonly known as the pale fern, is a member of the water fern family (Ceratopteridaceae). It is a perennial plant characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help in propagation. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
