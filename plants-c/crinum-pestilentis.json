    "intro": "Crinum pestilentis, commonly known as the stinking lily, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces large, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and red. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves and is often found in wetlands or along waterways. Its name comes from the strong, unpleasant odor it emits, which is thought to attract pollinators like flies. Crinum pestilentis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
