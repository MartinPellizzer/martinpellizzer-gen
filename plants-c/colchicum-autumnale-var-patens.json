    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale var. patens, commonly known as the autumn crocus, is a perennial plant native to western Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in the fall, typically from September to November. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that emerge from a corm, which is a modified stem that stores nutrients. It thrives in woodland or shaded areas with moist, well-drained soil. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care."
