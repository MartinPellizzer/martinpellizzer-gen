It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and elliptical leaves that are usually glabrous. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns from green to red as it matures. Calyptranthes discolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in warm, humid climates."
