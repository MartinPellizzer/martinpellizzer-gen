    "intro": "Chamaefilix fragrans var. foeniculacea, commonly known as the sweet fern, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northeastern United States. It features a dense, mat-forming growth habit with dark green, fern-like leaves that emit a mild, sweet aroma when crushed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by tiny, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Its unique appearance and pleasant scent make it a distinctive addition to native plant gardens."
