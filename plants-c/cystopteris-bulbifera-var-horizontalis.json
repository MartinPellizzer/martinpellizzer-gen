    "intro": "Cystopteris bulbifera var. horizontalis, commonly known as the horizontal shield fern, is a variant of the bulbiferous shield fern. It is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a creeping rhizome with fertile and sterile fronds that are often horizontal in growth habit. Its fronds are lanceolate to ovate, with a distinctive shield-like appearance, and produce spore-bearing structures on the underside. This variant is notable for its unique growth pattern and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
