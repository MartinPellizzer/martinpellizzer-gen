    "intro": "Cissus urupaensis, commonly known as the Urupa devil's ivy, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cissus urupaensis is adapted to grow in shaded or semi-shaded environments, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
