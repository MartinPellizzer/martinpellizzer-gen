    "intro": "Coccothrinax jucunda var. marquesensis, commonly known as the Marquesan palm, is a flowering plant species native to the island of Marquesas in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, multi-trunked structure with elongated leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the tropical climate with high humidity and salt spray. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
