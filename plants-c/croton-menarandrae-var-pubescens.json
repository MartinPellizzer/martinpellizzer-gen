It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
