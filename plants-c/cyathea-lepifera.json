    "intro": "Cyathea lepifera, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Cyathea lepifera plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various forest organisms."
