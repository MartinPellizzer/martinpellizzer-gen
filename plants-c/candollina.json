    "intro": "Candollina, commonly known as the white lily of the valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a slender, upright stem with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers with a faintly fragrant scent, typically blooming in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and have been historically used in traditional medicine for their mild sedative properties. The plant is also valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
