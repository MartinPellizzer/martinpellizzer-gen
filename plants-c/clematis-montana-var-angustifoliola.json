It features delicate, slender stems that can grow up to 15 feet in length, often twining around supports. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a finely toothed margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
