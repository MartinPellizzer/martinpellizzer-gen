    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis var. prorepens, commonly known as the creeping water-crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wet meadows and marshy areas. It features finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are typically submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist environments. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
