    "intro": "Calymmodon hygroscopicus, commonly known as the moisture-sensitive fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its ability to respond to changes in humidity. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's fronds are delicate and tend to curl or fold when exposed to dry conditions, a trait that helps it conserve moisture. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it often grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The species is notable for its adaptive strategies to thrive in fluctuating environmental conditions."
