    "intro": "Cytisus scoparius var. prostratus, commonly known as creeping yellow broom, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are covered in fine hairs. This variety is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions."
