    "intro": "Cocos poni, commonly known as the nipa palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, bamboo-like stems and feather-like leaves that grow in clusters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into drupes, or fruits, containing a single seed. Its root system forms a dense mat that helps prevent soil erosion in wetland areas. The nipa palm is often found in mangrove swamps and tidal mudflats, where it plays an important ecological role."
