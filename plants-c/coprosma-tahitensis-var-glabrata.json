It is native to the Society Islands of French Polynesia and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests and lowland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
