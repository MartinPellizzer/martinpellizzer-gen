    "intro": "Claytonia perfoliata subsp. perfoliata, commonly known as the purple heart or spring beauty, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features rosettes of fleshy, succulent leaves that are often tinged with purple or red, and it produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom early in the growing season."
