    "intro": "Clermontia clermontioides var. singuliflora, commonly known as the single-flowered clermontia, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red or orange. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks. It has elongated, lance-shaped leaves and produces a single flower per inflorescence, which is a distinguishing feature of the variety. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
