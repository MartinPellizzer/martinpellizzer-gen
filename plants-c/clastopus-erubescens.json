    "intro": "Clastopus erubescens, commonly known as the scarlet sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with a mat-forming habit, featuring fuzzy, grayish-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Clastopus erubescens plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
