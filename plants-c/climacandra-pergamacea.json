    "intro": "Climacandra pergamacea, commonly known as the parchment tree, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that resemble parchment, which give it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Its bark is smooth and grayish, while its branches are slender and often droop downward. Climacandra pergamacea is valued for its ornamental appearance and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
