    "intro": "Cenchrus barbatus, commonly known as the hairy grass or sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its wiry, hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are adapted to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. It is drought-tolerant and often found in sandy or disturbed soils. Cenchrus barbatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and is used in some traditional practices for its fibrous material."
