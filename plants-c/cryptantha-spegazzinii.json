    "intro": "Cryptantha spegazzinii, commonly known as the Sierra cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Nevada. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and mountain slopes. It is a perennial herb that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments it inhabits."
