    "intro": "Cyperus flavescens var. poiformis, commonly known as the yellow flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, making it common in marshy areas and along waterways. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, often forming dense stands. Botanically, it is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence structure and its ability to thrive in humid, aquatic environments."
