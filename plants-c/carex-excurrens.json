    "intro": "Carex excurrens, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, three-lobed spikelets that are typically brown or purplish in color. Native to wet or moist environments, this plant thrives in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex excurrens is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
