It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and usually ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
