    "intro": "Combretum multispicatum, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has a smooth, greyish bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The species is also valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand drought conditions."
