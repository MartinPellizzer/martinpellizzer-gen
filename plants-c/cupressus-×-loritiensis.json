It is a cross between Cupressus arizonica and Cupressus stephaniae, resulting in a plant with unique morphological characteristics. The tree typically grows as a tall, slender columnar form with dense, scale-like leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous cones and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in arid environments."
