It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flower heads, which are surrounded by pale blue to gray bracts. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery-white underside. This variety is well adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas."
