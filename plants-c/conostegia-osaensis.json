    "intro": "Conostegia osaensis, commonly known as the Osa Peninsula cedar, is a rare evergreen tree native to the Osa Peninsula in Costa Rica. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and aromatic resinous bark. The plant thrives in humid, tropical lowland forests and is adapted to the region's warm, moist climate. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important species for ecological studies in the region."
