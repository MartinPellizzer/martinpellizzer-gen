    "intro": "Ceratocephalus macropodus, commonly known as the large-headed sandbur, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bracts. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that detach easily, aiding in seed dispersal by wind and animals. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and open habitats."
