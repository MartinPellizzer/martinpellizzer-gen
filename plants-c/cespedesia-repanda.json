    "intro": "Cespedesia repanda, commonly known as the broadleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It typically grows in moist, tropical environments and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. It is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions. Its botanical features make it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions."
