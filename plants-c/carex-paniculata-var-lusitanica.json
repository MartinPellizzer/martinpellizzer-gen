    "intro": "Carex paniculata var. lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity."
