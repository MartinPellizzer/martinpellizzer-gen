It typically grows in moist or aquatic environments such as marshes, ponds, and stream edges. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white or pale green, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in wetland habitats and its unique leaf morphology adapted to aquatic conditions."
