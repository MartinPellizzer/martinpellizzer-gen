    "intro": "Cicercula, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, many of which are native to southern Africa. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. They produce small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures. Cicercula species are often found in grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
