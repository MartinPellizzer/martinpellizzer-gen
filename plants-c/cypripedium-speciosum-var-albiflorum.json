    "intro": "Cypripedium speciosum var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the temperate regions of East Asia. This variant is distinguished by its large, showy white petals and a uniquely shaped, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, often in association with decaying organic matter. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears a single flower, which blooms in late spring to early summer. Its botanical significance lies in its ornamental value and its role in ecological studies of orchid pollination and conservation."
