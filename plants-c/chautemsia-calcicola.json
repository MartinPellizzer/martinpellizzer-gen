    "intro": "Chautemsia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone chautemsia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It thrives in calcareous soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. The plant features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
