    "intro": "Cydonia media, commonly known as the Chinese quince, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China and Southeast Asia. It produces fragrant, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by pear-shaped, green fruits that ripen to a pale yellow or orange hue. The plant is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and dark green, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The fruit, while not typically eaten raw, is used in cooking and traditional medicine for its tart flavor and medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant in temperate climates."
