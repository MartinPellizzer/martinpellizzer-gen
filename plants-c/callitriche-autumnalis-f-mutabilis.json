    "intro": "Callitriche autumnalis f. mutabilis, commonly known as the autumn water starwort, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and streams. The plant features small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the fall, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink. Its leaves are floating or submerged, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variant is notable for its morphological variability, which can lead to different leaf and flower structures depending on environmental conditions."
