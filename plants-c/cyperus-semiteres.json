    "intro": "Cyperus semiteres, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Cyperus semiteres thrives in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it helps stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important species in wetland restoration efforts."
