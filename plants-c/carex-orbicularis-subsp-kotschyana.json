It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and along water edges. Its botanical features make it an important species in wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanic research."
