    "intro": "Crataegus hostii, commonly known as the Hostii hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 leaflets, and its showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus hostii is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly for its spring blossoms and autumn foliage. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, slightly acidic conditions."
