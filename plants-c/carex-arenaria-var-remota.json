    "intro": "Carex arenaria var. remota, commonly known as the remote sand sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically grows in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers. It is often found in tundra and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
