    "intro": "Cryptosepalum exfoliatum subsp. exfoliatum, commonly known as the exfoliating cryptosepalum, is a unique member of the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, with leaves that often peel or flake off in a manner that gives the plant its common name. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in spring, and it produces berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in moist, temperate regions of the southern United States."
