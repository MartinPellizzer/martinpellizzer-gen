    "intro": "Combretum costatum, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its striking, papery bracts that resemble flames, which are often more showy than its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a leathery texture and prominent veins. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
