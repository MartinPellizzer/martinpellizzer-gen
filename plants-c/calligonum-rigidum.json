    "intro": "Calligonum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing coastal and inland dunes. Calligonum rigidum is also used in rehabilitation projects due to its hardiness and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
