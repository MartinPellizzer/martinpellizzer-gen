    "intro": "Cyrtochilum williamsianum, commonly known as the Williams' orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high Andes of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive, narrow labellum. Cyrtochilum williamsianum is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system and linear, grass-like leaves. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
