    "intro": "Chromolaena herzogii, commonly known as the stinging nettle weed, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, serrated leaves and small yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces a milky sap that can cause skin irritation, giving it its common name. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and abandoned fields, and is considered an invasive species in some regions. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a challenging plant to control in agricultural and natural settings."
