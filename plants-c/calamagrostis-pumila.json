    "intro": "Calamagrostis pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, bottlebrush-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that adds ornamental value to gardens. Calamagrostis pumila is often used in landscaping for its low maintenance and ability to form dense, attractive clumps."
