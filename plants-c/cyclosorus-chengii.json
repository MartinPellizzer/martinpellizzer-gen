    "intro": "Cyclosorus chengii, commonly known as the Cheng's cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cyclosorus chengii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
