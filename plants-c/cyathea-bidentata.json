    "intro": "Cyathea bidentata, commonly known as the two-toothed tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, trunk-like stem covered in persistent, fibrous roots. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Cyathea bidentata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores, enabling its propagation through spore dispersal."
