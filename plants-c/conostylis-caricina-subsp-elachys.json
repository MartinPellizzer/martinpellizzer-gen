    "intro": "Conostylis caricina subsp. elachys, commonly known as the slender conostylis, is a small, erect herbaceous plant native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in late summer. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
