    "intro": "Cotoneaster frigidus var. affinis, commonly known as the dwarf cotoneaster, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing year-round visual interest. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in horticulture for its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
