    "intro": "Cyrtandra keithii, commonly known as the Keith's cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in the humid climate. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. Cyrtandra keithii is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
