    "intro": "Ceratozamia karsteniana, commonly known as the Karsten's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Mexico, specifically in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves. Its reproductive structures include a large, cone-like male strobilus and a smaller, spore-producing female strobilus. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Ceratozamia karsteniana is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
