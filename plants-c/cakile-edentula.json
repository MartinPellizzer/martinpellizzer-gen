    "intro": "Cakile edentula, commonly known as the coastal sandspur, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and Canada. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with small, fleshy, green leaves that help it retain moisture in sandy soils. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by small, round, reddish-brown seeds. It is adapted to harsh coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Cakile edentula plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines."
