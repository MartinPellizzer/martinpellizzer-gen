    "intro": "Crataegus korolkowii, commonly known as the Russian hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a sour taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
