    "intro": "Cotoneaster ataensis, commonly known as the Ata Valley cotoneaster, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, ovate leaves and clusters of red or orange berries that persist into winter. It thrives in cool, dry climates and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental berries and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
