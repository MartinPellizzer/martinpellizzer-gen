    "intro": "Cavendishia gomezii, commonly known as the Gomez's Cavendish, is a rare and striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its large, colorful inflorescence that can reach up to two meters in height, featuring vibrant red and orange bracts. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that form a rosette, creating a unique and dramatic appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
