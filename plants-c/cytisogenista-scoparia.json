    "intro": "Cytisogenista scoparia, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, showcasing a low, sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in drought conditions. Cytisogenista scoparia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
