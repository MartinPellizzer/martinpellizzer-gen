    "intro": "Chionanthus mildbraedii, commonly known as the mildbraed's fringeflower, is a rare and endangered shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters along the branches. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is a subject of conservation interest."
