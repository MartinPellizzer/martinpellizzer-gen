It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, slender stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Cerastium nitidum is typically used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers."
