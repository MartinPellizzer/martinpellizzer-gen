    "intro": "Chironia maritima var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea holly, is a coastal plant characterized by its slender, angular leaves and striking blue or purple flower heads. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in salt-laden environments. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are composite, consisting of numerous small florets arranged in a spherical shape. This variety is well adapted to maritime conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant found in many coastal regions."
