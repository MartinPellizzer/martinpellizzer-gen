    "intro": "[WRONG START] Codia rugosa, commonly known as rough cordia, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like texture on its stems and leaves, which are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various garden environments. Cordia rugosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
