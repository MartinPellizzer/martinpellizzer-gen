    "intro": "Cornutia pyramidata var. punctata, commonly known as the spotted cornutia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky inflorescence and small, tubular flowers that are typically green or pale yellow. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine, white hairs. This variety is notable for its unique spotted pattern on the bracts, which gives it its common name. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands."
