    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale var. bivonae, commonly known as the autumn crocus, is a perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking purple or violet flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features showy, spathaceous bracts that enclose the true flowers, which are typically smaller and more delicate. Its leaves are basal, broad, and heart-shaped, emerging after the flowers have bloomed. This variant is closely related to other members of the Colchicaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in gardens."
