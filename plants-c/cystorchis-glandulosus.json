It is characterized by its hairy or glandular stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Due to its unique appearance and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
