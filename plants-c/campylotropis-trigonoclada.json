    "intro": "Campylotropis trigonoclada, commonly known as the three-angled false indigo, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features slender, woody stems with a distinctive three-angled cross-section, which gives it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in clusters, typically ranging in color from white to pale blue. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and have a slightly rough texture. Campylotropis trigonoclada is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils in temperate climates."
