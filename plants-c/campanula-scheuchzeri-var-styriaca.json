    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri var. styriaca, commonly known as the Styrian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Alps. It features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
