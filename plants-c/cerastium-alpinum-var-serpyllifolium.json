    "intro": "Cerastium alpinum var. serpyllifolium, commonly known as alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in alpine gardens and rockeries."
