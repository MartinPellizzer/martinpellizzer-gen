    "intro": "Chailletia helferiana, commonly known as the Helfer's chailletia, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
