    "intro": "Chuniodendron, commonly known as the Chinese ironwood, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage, which contributes to its historical significance in traditional Chinese medicine and craftsmanship. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and temperate climates. Its botanical features include compound leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Chuniodendron is now classified as a critically endangered species."
