    "intro": "Centaurea transiens, commonly known as the transient centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Centaurea transiens is known for its short flowering period, which contributes to its common name. It is generally hardy and adaptable, making it a resilient species in its native range."
