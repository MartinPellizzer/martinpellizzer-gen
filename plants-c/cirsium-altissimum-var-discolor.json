It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple-tinged leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, purple-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in meadows and open woodlands. Its unique coloration and robust growth make it a notable species in botanical gardens and natural habitats."
