    "intro": "Colchicum serpentinum, commonly known as the serpent's root, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, helmet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in areas with limestone or serpentine rock, hence its common name. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces a distinctive, toxic bulb that is part of its reproductive structure. Colchicum serpentinum is a perennial plant that blooms in late summer and early autumn."
