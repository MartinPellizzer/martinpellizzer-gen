    "intro": "Corydalis latiflora subsp. gerdae, commonly known as the broadleaf corydalis, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of China. It features slender, branched stems that bear opposite, lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers have two lower petals that are fused into a spurred shape, a characteristic feature of the Corydalis genus. The plant thrives in well-drained, moist soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats."
