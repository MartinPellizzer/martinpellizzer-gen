    "intro": "Ceratocaulos, commonly known as the horned shield fern, is a member of the Blechnaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, shield-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, horn-like projections. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its leaves are usually evergreen. Ceratocaulos is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
