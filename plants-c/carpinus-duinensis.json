    "intro": "Carpinus duinensis, commonly known as the coastal hornbeam, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal areas of southern Africa. It has smooth, dark grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are elliptical with a pointed tip and a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are eaten by various bird species. It is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a characteristic species of coastal dune environments."
