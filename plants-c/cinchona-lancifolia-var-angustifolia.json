    "intro": "Cinchona lancifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is notable for its alkaloid-rich bark, which contains quinine, a compound historically used in the treatment of malaria. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Its botanical significance is further enhanced by its role in traditional medicine and its importance in the history of pharmaceutical science."
