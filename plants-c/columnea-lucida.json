    "intro": "Columnea lucida, commonly known as the shining columnea, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are trailing or shrub-like. Columnea lucida is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
