    "intro": "Cypripedium praestans, commonly known as the showy lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers that resemble a truss of hair. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it produces a single, showy inflorescence that blooms in late spring to early summer. Cypripedium praestans is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
