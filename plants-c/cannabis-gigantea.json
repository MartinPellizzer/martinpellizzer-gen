    "intro": "Cannabis gigantea, commonly known as the giant cannabis plant, is a tall, herbaceous annual that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. It features large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically broad and serrated. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are rich in cannabinoids such as THC and CBD. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires ample sunlight and nutrient-rich soil. Due to its size and potency, it is often cultivated for both medicinal and recreational purposes."
