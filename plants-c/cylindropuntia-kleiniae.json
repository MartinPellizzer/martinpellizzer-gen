It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in spines and are often segmented. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This cactus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and hardy nature."
