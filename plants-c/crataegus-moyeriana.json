    "intro": "Crataegus moyeriana, commonly known as Moyer's hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with serrated edges, and turn vibrant colors in the fall. Moyer's hawthorn is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and moist soils, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
