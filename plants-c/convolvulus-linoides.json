    "intro": "Convolvulus linoides, commonly known as the sand bur or desert bindweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy stems that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bur-like seed pods that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a rough texture adapted to hot, dry environments. Convolvulus linoides is often found in sandy soils and can be invasive in some regions."
