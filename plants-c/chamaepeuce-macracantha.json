    "intro": "Chamaepeuce macracantha, commonly known as the large-leafed chamaepeuce, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in early to mid-summer. Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Chamaepeuce macracantha is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks."
