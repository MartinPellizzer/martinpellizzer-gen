    "intro": "Centrosema pubescens, commonly known as the hairy lespedeza, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are covered in fine hairs, and its clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. Centrosema pubescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in erosion control practices."
