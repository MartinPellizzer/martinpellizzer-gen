    "intro": "Chrysanthemum heimerlii, commonly known as the Japanese chrysanthemum, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia. It features finely divided, silver-gray foliage that adds ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for temperate climates. Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
