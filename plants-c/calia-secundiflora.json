    "intro": "Calia secundiflora, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Calia secundiflora is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with poor soil, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. Its ability to store water in its stems helps it survive in low-rainfall conditions."
