    "intro": "Chloradenia, commonly known as the green orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a greenish or yellowish coloration that distinguishes it from other orchid genera. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Chloradenia species have small, delicate flowers with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
