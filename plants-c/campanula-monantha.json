    "intro": "Campanula monantha, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of bell-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and prefers well-drained soils in partial to full shade. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to gardens. Campanula monantha is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
