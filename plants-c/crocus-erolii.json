    "intro": "Crocus erolii, commonly known as the Erol's crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its early blooming habit, often appearing in late autumn or early winter. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which are surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat."
