    "intro": "Cortusina, commonly known as the snowflake plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cortaderiaceae. It is characterized by its striking, feathery plumes that resemble snowflakes, which are typically white or cream in color. The plant is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in temperate climates. Cortusina species are perennial, often growing in clumps and producing small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring. These plants are popular in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to add texture and visual interest to landscapes."
