    "intro": "Crataegus pearsonii, commonly known as Pearson's hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pinkish flowers in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. Crataegus pearsonii is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
