    "intro": "Cousinia alpina, commonly known as the alpine cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, hairy leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. Its flowers are clustered in dense, pinkish-white inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Cousinia alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
