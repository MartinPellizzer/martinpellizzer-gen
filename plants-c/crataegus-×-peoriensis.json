    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 peoriensis, commonly known as the Chicago thornapple, is a hybrid hawthorn species native to the Midwestern United States. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to elliptic leaves, and showy white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
