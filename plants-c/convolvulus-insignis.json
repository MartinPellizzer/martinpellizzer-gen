It is a herbaceous annual that produces vibrant blue or violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a trailing growth habit with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Convolvulus insignis is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy or rocky soils."
