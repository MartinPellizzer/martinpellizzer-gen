    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. regia, commonly known as the royal palm, is a cultivar of the coconut palm native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that give it a regal appearance. The plant produces coconuts, which are encased in a hard outer shell and contain both water and flesh. It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil and requires ample sunlight. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and in some regions for coconut production."
