    "intro": "Clidemia subspicata, commonly known as the mist flower or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. It has a spreading habit and can form dense mats, often outcompeting native vegetation in disturbed areas. Clidemia subspicata is also known for its rapid growth and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
