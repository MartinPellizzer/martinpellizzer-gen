    "intro": "Clidemia capituliflora, commonly known as the Hawaiian false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments. Clidemia capituliflora is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, making it an invasive species in some areas. Its rapid growth and spread have led to its classification as a noxious weed in parts of its range."
