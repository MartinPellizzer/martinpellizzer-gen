    "intro": "Cupressus himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a conical or columnar shape with dense, scale-like leaves. The tree produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers followed by woody cones that release seeds. It is well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine forests. The wood of Cupressus himalaica is durable and has been used in traditional construction and craftsmanship."
