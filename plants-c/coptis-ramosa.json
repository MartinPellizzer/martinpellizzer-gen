It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces elliptical, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its rhizomes are rich in alkaloids, particularly berberine, which has been used in traditional medicine. Coptis ramosa typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
