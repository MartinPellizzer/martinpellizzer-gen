    "intro": "Caladenia startiorum, commonly known as the pink-streaked spider-orchid, is an endemic orchid species found in Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, strikingly pink flower with a distinctive black or purple stripe. The plant typically grows in sandy soils within dry, open habitats. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly thynnid wasps, which are attracted to its nectar. Caladenia startiorum is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
