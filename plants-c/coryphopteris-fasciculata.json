    "intro": "Coryphopteris fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arranged in a compact, clustered form. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species."
