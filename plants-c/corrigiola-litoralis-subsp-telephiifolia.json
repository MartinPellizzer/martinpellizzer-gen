    "intro": "Corrigiola litoralis subsp. telephiifolia, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe. It is a low-growing, mat-forming species that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often in harsh maritime environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. This subspecies is notable for its salt tolerance and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
