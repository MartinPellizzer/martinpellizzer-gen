    "intro": "Colymbada mannagettae, commonly known as the dwarf water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with abundant sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
