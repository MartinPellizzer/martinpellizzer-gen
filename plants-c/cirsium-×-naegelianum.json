    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 naegelianum, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. It is a sterile hybrid between Cirsium arvense and Cirsium vulgare, which contributes to its unique botanical features. Due to its robust growth and adaptability, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
