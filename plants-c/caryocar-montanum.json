    "intro": "Caryocar montanum, commonly known as the Brazilian chestnut or cupua\u00e7u, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Caryocaraceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces large, yellowish-green flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody, pear-shaped fruits. The fruit contains a single large seed surrounded by a sweet, mucilaginous pulp, which is highly valued for its nutritional and commercial properties. Caryocar montanum plays an important ecological role in the Amazon, providing food for various wildlife species and contributing to the region's biodiversity."
