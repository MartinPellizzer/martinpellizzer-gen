The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Ceropegia ciliatioris is a popular choice for hanging baskets or as a trailing plant in gardens due to its ornamental appeal."
