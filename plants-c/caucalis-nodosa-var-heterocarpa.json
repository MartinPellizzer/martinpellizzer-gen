    "intro": "Caucalis nodosa var. heterocarpa, commonly known as the heterocarpic nodding bellflower, is a flowering plant belonging to the Boraginaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. The plant features hairy stems and leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with lance-shaped foliage. Its fruit is a unique, inflated capsule that splits open to release seeds, a feature that sets it apart from other varieties of Caucalis. This plant is often found in rocky or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid regions."
