    "intro": "Clidemia neglecta, commonly known as the velvetleaf or stinging nettle, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact with the skin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Clidemia neglecta is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, making it a potential invasive species in certain regions."
