    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. intermedia, commonly known as the middle English hawthorn, is a variant of the common hawthorn. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. The plant is characterized by its thorny branches, oval leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that appear in spring. It produces red, juicy berries in the autumn, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. The wood is hard and has been historically used for tool handles and other small crafts."
