    "intro": "Cassia cernua, commonly known as the weeping cassia, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its drooping, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive, cascading appearance. The plant produces bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature. Cassia cernua is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun."
