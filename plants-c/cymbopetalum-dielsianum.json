    "intro": "Cymbopetalum dielsianum, commonly known as the Diels' corymbiferous orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
