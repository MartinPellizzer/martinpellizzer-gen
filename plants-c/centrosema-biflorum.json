    "intro": "Centrosema biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered centrosema, is a leguminous plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family and is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it is sometimes cultivated in agricultural and ecological restoration settings."
