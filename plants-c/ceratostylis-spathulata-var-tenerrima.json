It features a slender, wiry stem with a few leaves and produces a single, elongated inflorescence bearing small, greenish-white flowers. The plant prefers shady, moist habitats and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
