    "intro": "Codonorhiza, commonly known as the common morning glory, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Convolvulaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive spiral-shaped flowers and heart-shaped leaves. They are native to various regions in the Americas and are often found growing along roadsides and in disturbed soils. Codonorhiza species are climbing vines that can reach significant lengths, using their tendrils to support themselves. They are also valued for their ornamental beauty and have been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
