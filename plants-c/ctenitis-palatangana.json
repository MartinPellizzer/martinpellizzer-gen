    "intro": "Ctenitis palatangana, commonly known as the Palatanga fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated or toothed margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate and absorb nutrients. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which may aid in attracting pollinators or deterring herbivores."
