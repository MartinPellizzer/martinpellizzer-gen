    "intro": "Cycas rumphii subsp. normanbyana, commonly known as the Normanby's cycad, is a species of cycad native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a tropical or subtropical climate. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
