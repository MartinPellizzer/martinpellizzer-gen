This aquatic plant is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically four-lobed and resemble a four-leaf clover. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats on the water surface. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for water quality and its use in ecological studies."
