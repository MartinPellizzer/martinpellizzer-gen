    "intro": "Crataegus bicolor, commonly known as the white thornapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its doubly serrated leaves and showy white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are edible but often have a tart flavor. Crataegus bicolor thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodlands, thickets, and along stream banks. Its thorny branches and ornamental flowers make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
