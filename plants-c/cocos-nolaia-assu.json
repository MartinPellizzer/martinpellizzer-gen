    "intro": "Cocos nolaia-assu, commonly known as the Nolaia-Assu coconut, is a rare and lesser-known species of the coconut palm. It is native to specific regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical climates with high humidity. The plant produces coconuts that are typically smaller than those of the more common Cocos nucifera. Its botanical features include a tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The fruit contains both a liquid endosperm and a solid kernel, making it valuable for both culinary and traditional uses."
