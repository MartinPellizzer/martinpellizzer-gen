    "intro": "Calophyllum thorelii, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, glossy green leaves that are alternate and elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing bright red seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and timber, it is also cultivated in horticulture and forestry."
