    "intro": "Campanula lyrata var. albostrigosa, commonly known as the white-streaked bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically blue to violet in color, with white streaks on the petals. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and long blooming period in late summer."
