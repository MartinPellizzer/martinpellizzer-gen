    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia f. silvicola, commonly known as the forest bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to woodland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its round, broad leaves and bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for shaded garden settings. The subspecies silvicola is distinguished by its more robust stems and slightly larger flowers compared to the typical form."
