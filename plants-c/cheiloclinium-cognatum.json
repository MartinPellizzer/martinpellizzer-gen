It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces elongated, woody pods containing edible, sweet-smelling seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and tropical regions. Due to its ornamental value and unique fragrance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
