    "intro": "Codonorhiza elandsmontana, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred petals and compact growth habit. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky crevices or forested slopes. Its blooming season typically occurs during the spring, producing fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
