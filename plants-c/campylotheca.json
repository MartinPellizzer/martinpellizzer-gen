    "intro": "Campylotheca, commonly known as the bottlebrush tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescences, which resemble bottle brushes due to their dense clusters of red or pink bracts. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a glossy surface. Native to Australia, Campylotheca species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal environments. These plants are also valued for their ability to attract birds and pollinators."
