    "intro": "Centella callioda, commonly known as Asiatic pennywort, is a creeping herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter. The plant produces white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
