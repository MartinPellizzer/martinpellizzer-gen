    "intro": "Crotalaria retusa, commonly known as yellow rattle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa, Europe, and Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of yellow, spurred flowers that bloom from summer to autumn. The plant has palmate leaves with three to five leaflets, and its roots produce a toxic alkaloid called crotalarine. It is often found in disturbed soils and is known for its ability to suppress the growth of surrounding vegetation through allelopathy. This plant is also valued in ecological restoration projects for its role in promoting biodiversity in grassland ecosystems."
