It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces catkin-like male flowers and female flowers in separate clusters, followed by edible, nut-like fruits enclosed in a cupule. Its flowers and nuts are important food sources for various wildlife species. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in woodlands and stream valleys."
