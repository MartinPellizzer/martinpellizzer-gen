    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 figertii, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex acutata and Carex lyngbyana, showcasing characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically forms dense clumps of grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are often dark green in color. It prefers moist to wet soils and is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in wet conditions, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
