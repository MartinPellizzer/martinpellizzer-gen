    "intro": "Calamagrostis \u00d7 intermedia, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking silver-gray foliage that turns bronze in the fall. The plant produces tall, slender panicles of pale blue to silver flowers in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and erosion control."
