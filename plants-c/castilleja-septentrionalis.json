    "intro": "Castilleja septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on root connections to host plants for water and nutrients. It thrives in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often forming dense colonies. Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
