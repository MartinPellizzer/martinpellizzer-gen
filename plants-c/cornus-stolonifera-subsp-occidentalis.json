    "intro": "Cornus stolonifera subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as Western Ninebark, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread via stolons. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are elliptical, with serrated edges, and turn vibrant shades of red or orange in autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to well-drained soils."
