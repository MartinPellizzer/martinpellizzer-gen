    "intro": "Calypso salacioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a leafless plant that derives all its nutrients from its symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a unique, intricate structure that resembles a ghostly figure. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees or in the canopy. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a vulnerable species."
