    "intro": "Condylopodium fuliginosum, commonly known as the sooty bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on its bladders for buoyancy and nutrient absorption. The sooty bladderwort is often found in muddy or dark water, where it thrives in low-light conditions."
