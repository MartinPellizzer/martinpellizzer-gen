    "intro": "Campyloneurum nitidissimum var. latior, commonly known as the broad-leafed huperzia, is a species of clubmoss native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a compact rosette. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its sporophytes are small, with a single, spore-bearing cone at the tip of each shoot. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage structure."
