    "intro": "Cordylostigma microcala, commonly known as the small-leaved cordylostigma, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, which includes many diverse and colorful orchids. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces tiny, pale green flowers that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
