    "intro": "Cranichis schaffneri, commonly known as the Schaffner's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically blooms during the summer months and is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the poor soils of its environment. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
