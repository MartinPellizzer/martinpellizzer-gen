    "intro": "Costus productus var. productus, commonly known as the flame grass, is a tropical ornamental plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking, bright red to orange flowers that bloom in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a cut flower."
