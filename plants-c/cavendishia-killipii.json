    "intro": "Cavendishia killipii, commonly known as the Killip's Cavendishia, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often display vivid colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on its aerial roots for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are short-lived but attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and hummingbirds. Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, Cavendishia killipii is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
