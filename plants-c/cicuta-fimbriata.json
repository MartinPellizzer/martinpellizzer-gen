    "intro": "Cicuta fimbriata, commonly known as water hemlock, is a highly toxic member of the parsley family (Apiaceae). It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant contains potent toxic compounds, including cicutoxin, which can cause severe poisoning in humans and animals. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and wetlands. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is often considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
