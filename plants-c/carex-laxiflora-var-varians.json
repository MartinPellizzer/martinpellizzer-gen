    "intro": "Carex laxiflora var. varians, commonly known as the variable sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their rhizomatous growth habits. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variant is notable for its variability in leaf and spikelet morphology, contributing to its common name."
