    "intro": "Cynanchum pearsonianum, commonly known as the American milkweed vine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing toxic, milky sap. It is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by herbivores, making it a less common subject in ecological studies."
