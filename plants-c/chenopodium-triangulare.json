    "intro": "Chenopodium triangulare, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its triangular, spiny leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and thrives in full sun. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits called achene. Chenopodium triangulare is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
