    "intro": "Cecropia sciadophylla var. juranyiana, commonly known as the Juranyi's ceiba, is a fast-growing, evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. The plant has a unique relationship with ants, hosting them in specialized hollow stems as a form of mutualistic defense. Its trunk is often buttressed, providing structural support in the dense forest understory. The species is also noted for its rapid growth rate, making it valuable for reforestation and agroforestry projects."
