    "intro": "Cyperus atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of Africa and the Caribbean. It typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes and saline soils, and is well adapted to brackish water conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often green or brown in color. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas. Cyperus atlanticus plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
