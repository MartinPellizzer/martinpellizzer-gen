It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has grass-like leaves that are generally narrow and cylindrical, with a fibrous root system. Its flowering structure consists of a spike of small, greenish-brown flowers that are clustered in a dense inflorescence. Carex brevicollis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
