    "intro": "Corysanthes umbonata, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Corysanthes umbonata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
