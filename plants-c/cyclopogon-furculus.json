    "intro": "Cyclopogon furculus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cyclopogon, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green flowers. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
