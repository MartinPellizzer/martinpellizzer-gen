    "intro": "Caryodaphne laevigata, commonly known as the smooth-leafed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth to the touch, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds. Caryodaphne laevigata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
