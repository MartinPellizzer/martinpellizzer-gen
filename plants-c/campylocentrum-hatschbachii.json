    "intro": "Campylocentrum hatschbachii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
