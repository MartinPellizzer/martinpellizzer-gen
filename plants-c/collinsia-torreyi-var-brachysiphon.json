    "intro": "Collinsia torreyi var. brachysiphon, commonly known as the narrow-siphon checkerspot, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its showy, butterfly-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodland areas, preferring partial shade to full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and erect. This variety is distinguished by its shorter siphon tubes in the flowers compared to other varieties of Collinsia torreyi."
