    "intro": "Couepia panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian couepia, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Panama. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, alternate leaves, and showy, pentagonal flowers that typically bloom in yellow or green hues. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
