    "intro": "Carex riabushinskii, commonly known as the Riabushinskii sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to the Russian Far East and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its preference for cool, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
