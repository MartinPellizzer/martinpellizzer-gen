    "intro": "Cephalomanes javanicum, commonly known as the Java headman crab, is a unique marine species belonging to the family Brachyura. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated carapace and specialized morphology adapted for its benthic lifestyle. This crab is typically found in tropical and subtropical coastal regions, where it thrives in sandy or muddy substrates. Its botanical aspects are less emphasized compared to its ecological and behavioral traits, as it is primarily an animal rather than a plant. However, its habitat and ecological interactions are closely tied to the botanical composition of its environment."
