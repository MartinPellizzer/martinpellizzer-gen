    "intro": "Convolvulus carduchorum, commonly known as Armenian bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with trailing stems that produce small, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along riverbanks. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
