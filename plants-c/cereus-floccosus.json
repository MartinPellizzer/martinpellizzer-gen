    "intro": "Cereus floccosus, commonly known as the woolly candleplant, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that are often fragrant. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a succulent stem that stores water. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
