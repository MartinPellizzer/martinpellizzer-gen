    "intro": "Cuscuta sojagena, commonly known as the soybean dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that attaches itself to host plants, primarily soybeans, to obtain nutrients. It lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host for sustenance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid life cycle, often completing its growth within a few weeks. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through agricultural practices, making it a persistent weed in soybean fields. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce crop yields and is a challenge for farmers."
