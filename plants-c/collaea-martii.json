    "intro": "Collaea martii, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Collaea martii is often found in alpine regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
