    "intro": "Chaenomeles cardinalis var. alba, commonly known as the whiteflowered Chinese quince, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves and showy, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, yellow, edible fruits that ripen in late summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance. The variety is distinguished by its pale white flowers, setting it apart from the more common red-flowered varieties of Chaenomeles."
