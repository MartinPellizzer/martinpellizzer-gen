    "intro": "Cyathodes divaricata, commonly known as the variable cyathodes, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive cyathium inflorescence, which consists of a cup-like structure that houses both male and female flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, showing adaptations to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and often pale in color, contributing to its ecological role in pollination and seed dispersal."
