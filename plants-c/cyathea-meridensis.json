    "intro": "Cyathea meridensis, commonly known as the southern tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to southern South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, compound fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
