    "intro": "Cymbalaria minor, commonly known as the lesser heartwort, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender stems that often lie close to the ground, producing small, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of delicate, blue or violet flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, making it an ecologically valuable species."
