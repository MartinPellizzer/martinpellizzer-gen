    "intro": "Cheilanthes remota, commonly known as the remote lip fern, is a species of fern native to arid and rocky habitats in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, fuzzy hairs. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes remota is often found growing on rock faces or in crevices, making it a resilient and hardy species in harsh environments."
