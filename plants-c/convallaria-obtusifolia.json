    "intro": "Convallaria obtusifolia, commonly known as blunt-leaved lily of the valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features opposite, broad, ovate leaves that are often described as blunt or rounded at the tips. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped, white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its flowers give way to red berries that contain toxic seeds, which are a characteristic feature of the genus Convallaria. The plant is typically found in woodland areas and prefers moist, shaded environments."
