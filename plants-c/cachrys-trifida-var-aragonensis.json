    "intro": "Cachrys trifida var. aragonensis, commonly known as the Aragon mountain cactus, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Spain. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of desert and arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It has adapted to thrive in rocky soils and high altitudes with minimal rainfall. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
