It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as stream banks, marshes, and wet meadows. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Carex ripariiformis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
