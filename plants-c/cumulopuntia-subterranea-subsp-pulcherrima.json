    "intro": "Cumulopuntia subterranea subsp. pulcherrima, commonly known as the Mexican ground cactus, is a unique cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its subterranean growth habit helps it survive in arid environments by reducing water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry conditions."
