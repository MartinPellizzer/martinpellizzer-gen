    "intro": "Celtis macrophylla, commonly known as the Australian sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, smooth fruits that split open to release seeds. Its bark is thick, fissured, and grayish in color, providing a distinctive appearance. Celtis macrophylla is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in open forests."
