    "intro": "Carex atrata var. longistolonifera, commonly known as black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated. This variety is distinguished by its elongated, stoloniferous stems, which allow it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies."
