    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 lawrebel, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or white in color. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to form clumps over time. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often arranged in a fan shape. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is highly sought after in horticulture but is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
