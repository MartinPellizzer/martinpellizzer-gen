    "intro": "Cochemiea goodridgei, commonly known as the Goodridge's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, leafless cactus with a globular or cylindrical stem that often branches at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its thick, ribbed stems are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Cochemiea goodridgei is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
