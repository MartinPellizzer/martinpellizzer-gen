    "intro": "Clerodendrum ovatum, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a flowering shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are often red or orange in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in umbels, surrounded by the showy bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, adding to its distinctive appearance."
