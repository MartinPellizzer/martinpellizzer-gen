    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris rubelliformis, commonly known as the red-veined weed or red bursa, is a variant of the common groundsel. It is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, yellow flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The species is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils. Its distinctive red veins in the leaves make it easily identifiable. This plant is typically annual, with a short life cycle and a tendency to spread rapidly in agricultural and urban areas."
