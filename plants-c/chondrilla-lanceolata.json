    "intro": "Chondrilla lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf burrweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters tall, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by the development of spiny, bristly seed heads. Chondrilla lanceolata is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in sandy areas."
