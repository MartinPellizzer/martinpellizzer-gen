    "intro": "Castilleja hololeuca subsp. grisea, commonly known as the grayleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red to orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a slender, erect stem with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine grayish pubescence. It forms symbiotic relationships with certain root systems of host plants, drawing nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. This species is often found in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe."
