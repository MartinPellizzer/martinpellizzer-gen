    "intro": "Colpodium wrightii, commonly known as Wright's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. It has whorled leaves that are often submerged, with small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom above the water surface. Colpodium wrightii is a carnivorous plant that plays a unique role in its ecosystem by contributing to nutrient cycling in aquatic habitats."
