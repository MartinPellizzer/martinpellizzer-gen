    "intro": "Crotalaria nitens var. trichina, commonly known as the hairy crotalaria, is a tropical flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, yellow, pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant is native to regions of Africa and is often found in disturbed soils and grasslands. It has a short growth season and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia. Due to its hairy texture and unique morphology, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
