    "intro": "Cheilanthes patula, commonly known as the desert shield fern, is a species of fern native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, low-growing plant that typically forms dense mats on rocky soils or crevices. The plant has thick, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its ability to survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
