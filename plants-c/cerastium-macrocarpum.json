    "intro": "Cerastium macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by rounded, fleshy fruits that are distinctive in appearance. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. Due to its delicate foliage and unique fruit structure, it is of interest to botanists and gardeners alike."
