    "intro": "Cerastium echinulatum, commonly known as the prickly chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along streambanks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Cerastium echinulatum is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
