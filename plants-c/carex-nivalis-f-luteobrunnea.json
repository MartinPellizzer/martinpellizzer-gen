    "intro": "Carex nivalis f. luteobrunnea, commonly known as the golden-brown sedge, is a perennial plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that ranges in color from pale yellow to golden-brown, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open, rocky habitats such as tundra and alpine meadows. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Due to its unique coloration and habitat preferences, it is often used in ecological restoration projects and as an ornamental plant in gardens."
