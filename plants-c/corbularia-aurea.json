    "intro": "Corbularia aurea, commonly known as the golden sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and rocky coastal areas. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It is well adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a common sight in coastal dunes and beaches. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in coastal plant communities."
