    "intro": "Cuscuta compacta, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth rate, often forming dense mats on its host. The plant's stems are thread-like and twining, allowing it to wrap around and attach to various plants. It is commonly found in disturbed areas and can infest a wide range of host species. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host plants."
