    "intro": "Chromolaena adenolepis, commonly known as crofton weed, is a shrub native to the Americas but has become an invasive species in many tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by fluffy, white seeds that are easily dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, pastures, and degraded forests. Due to its aggressive growth, it can outcompete native vegetation and is considered a significant ecological threat."
