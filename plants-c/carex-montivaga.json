    "intro": "Carex montivaga, commonly known as the mountain sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a spiky cluster of small, wind-pollinated flowers, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments. Carex montivaga is valued for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal."
