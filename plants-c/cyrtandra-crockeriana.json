    "intro": "Cyrtandra crockeriana, commonly known as Crocker's flameplant, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories, where it thrives in the humid climate. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture and a glossy appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyrtandra crockeriana is considered a rare and endangered species."
