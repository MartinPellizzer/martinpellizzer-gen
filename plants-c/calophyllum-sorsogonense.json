    "intro": "Calophyllum sorsogonense, commonly known as the Sorsogonense Mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown to black bark and elliptical, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries containing a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. Due to its ornamental value and potential for timber, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
