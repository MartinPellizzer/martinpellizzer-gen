    "intro": "Calceolaria werdermannii, commonly known as the Werdermann's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andes of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant produces delicate, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
