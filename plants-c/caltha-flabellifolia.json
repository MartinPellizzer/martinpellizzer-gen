    "intro": "Caltha flabellifolia, commonly known as the golden ragwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Europe. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments like woodland floors and stream banks. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
