    "intro": "Chrysocoma villosa, commonly known as the woolly chrysocoma, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are usually visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance in local ecosystems."
