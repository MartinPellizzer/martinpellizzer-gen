    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 minos, commonly known as the Minos lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a defining feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without being exposed to direct sunlight. Its leaves are usually broad and dark green, and it produces a single or few flowers per stem during the spring or early summer. The Minos lady's slipper is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
