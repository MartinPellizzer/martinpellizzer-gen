    "intro": "Cottendorfia savannensis, commonly known as the Florida sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cottendorfia savannensis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
