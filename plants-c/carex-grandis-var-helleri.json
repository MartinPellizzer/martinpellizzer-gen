    "intro": "Carex grandis var. helleri, commonly known as Heller's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves arranged in dense, grass-like clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Heller's sedge is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
