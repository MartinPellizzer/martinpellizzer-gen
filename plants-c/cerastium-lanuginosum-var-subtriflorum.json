    "intro": "Cerastium lanuginosum var. subtriflorum, commonly known as the downy chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, downy hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is often found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
