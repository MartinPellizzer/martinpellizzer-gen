    "intro": "Conyza nemoralis, commonly known as the field ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Conyza nemoralis is often considered a weed but has ecological value by providing nectar for pollinators."
