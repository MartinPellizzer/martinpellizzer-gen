    "intro": "Cardaminopsis suecica, commonly known as the Swedish water clover, is a rare and distinctive flowering plant native to northern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of its close relative, the water crowfoot. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
