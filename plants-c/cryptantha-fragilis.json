It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. The flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in early summer and are followed by narrow, pod-like fruits that release tiny seeds when mature."
