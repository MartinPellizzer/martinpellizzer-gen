    "intro": "Cryptocarya pendulifolia, commonly known as the hanging leaf cryptocarya, is a species of evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and it produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters. Cryptocarya pendulifolia is typically found in coastal and lowland forest habitats, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
