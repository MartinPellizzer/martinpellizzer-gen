    "intro": "Chuquiraga racemosa, commonly known as the Andean burr or chuquiraga, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces distinctive, spiny, bract-covered seed pods that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in high-altitude, semi-arid environments. Chuquiraga racemosa is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat."
