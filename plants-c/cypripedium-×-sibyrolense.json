    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 sibyrolense, commonly known as the Siberian lady's tresses, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Russia and northern China. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and dense, dark green foliage, which supports its showy inflorescence of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of tubular flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils under partial shade, often found in forested areas with cool, humid conditions. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
