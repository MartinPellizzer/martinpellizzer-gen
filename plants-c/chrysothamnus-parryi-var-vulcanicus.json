    "intro": "Chrysothamnus parryi var. vulcanicus, commonly known as the volcanic goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States, particularly in areas with volcanic soil. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it reflect the intense sunlight in its arid habitat. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and aid in survival in harsh environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
