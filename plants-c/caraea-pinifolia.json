    "intro": "Caraea pinifolia, commonly known as the silver leaf or pineleaf plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Caraea pinifolia is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
