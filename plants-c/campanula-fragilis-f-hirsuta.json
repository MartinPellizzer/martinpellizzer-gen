    "intro": "Campanula fragilis f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its distinguishing \"hirsuta\" characteristic. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, contributing to its overall rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and woodland borders."
