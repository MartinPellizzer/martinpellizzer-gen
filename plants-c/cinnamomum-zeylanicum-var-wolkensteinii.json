    "intro": "Cinnamomum zeylanicum var. wolkensteinii, commonly known as Ceylon cinnamon, is a variant of the cinnamon tree native to Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its aromatic, thin, and delicate cinnamon bark, which is distinct from the thicker bark of Chinese cinnamon. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by ellipsoid berries containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. This variety is highly valued for its use in culinary and medicinal applications due to its unique flavor and essential oils."
