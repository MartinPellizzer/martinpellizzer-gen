    "intro": "Crataegus exilis, commonly known as the slender hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. The plant produces red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins, and it is often found in moist woodlands or along stream banks. Crataegus exilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native habitats."
