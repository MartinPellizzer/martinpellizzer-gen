    "intro": "Corylus arborea, commonly known as the European hazel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkins in early spring, with male and female flowers on separate plants. Its edible nuts are enclosed in a spiky husk and are a food source for various wildlife. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
