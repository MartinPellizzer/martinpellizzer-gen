    "intro": "Carpha aristata, commonly known as the arrowhead grass, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. Carpha aristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wet environments."
