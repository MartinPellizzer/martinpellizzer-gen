It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, often with a distinctive purple or red throat. The plant typically blooms in early spring, making it one of the first flowers to appear after winter. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a bulbous underground stem. The glory crocus is well-suited for rock gardens and borders, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun."
