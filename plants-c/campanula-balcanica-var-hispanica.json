    "intro": "Campanula balcanica var. hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features showy, bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
