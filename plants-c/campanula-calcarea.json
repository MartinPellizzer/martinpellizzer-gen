    "intro": "Campanula calcarea, commonly known as the limestone bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and calcareous soils in Europe. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in limestone cliffs and grassy slopes. Campanula calcarea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
