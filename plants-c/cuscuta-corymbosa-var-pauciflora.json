    "intro": "Cuscuta corymbosa var. pauciflora, commonly known as the scarlet devil or dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, clustered yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and ornamental plants."
