    "intro": "Cedrela alternifolia, commonly known as the African teak, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an important species for reforestation and conservation efforts."
