    "intro": "Coccoloba arborescens, commonly known as the red mangrove or red buttonwood, is a coastal plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests. The plant has smooth, waxy leaves that are typically red or reddish-purple in color, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers are followed by round, red berries that provide food for various wildlife. Coccoloba arborescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting biodiversity in tidal zones."
