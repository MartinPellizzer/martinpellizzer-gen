    "intro": "Cycas falcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, pinnate leaves that are narrow and strap-like. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Cycas falcata is a slow-growing, ancient plant that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back to the Mesozoic era."
