    "intro": "Corymbis trukensis, commonly known as the Truk Islands corymbis, is a rare flowering plant native to the Caroline Islands. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in coastal or lowland forests. Its ornamental value has led to some cultivation efforts, though it remains uncommon in horticultural trade. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in its native range."
