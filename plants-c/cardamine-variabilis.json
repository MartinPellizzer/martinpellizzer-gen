    "intro": "Cardamine variabilis, commonly known as variable watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes other well-known plants like mustard and cabbage. The plant typically grows in shady, wet environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its leaves are alternate, often divided into small, lobed segments, and it produces small white or greenish flowers. The species is noted for its variable morphology, which contributes to its common name and makes it a subject of taxonomic interest."
