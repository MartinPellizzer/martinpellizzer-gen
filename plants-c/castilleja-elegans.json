    "intro": "Castilleja elegans, commonly known as the elegant paintbrush, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking red-orange to yellow flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows and grasslands, often in the western United States. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and its flowers are arranged in dense, brush-like clusters. Castilleja elegans plays an important ecological role by providing nectar to pollinators like bees and butterflies."
