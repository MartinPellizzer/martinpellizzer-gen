    "intro": "Cheiloclinium articulatum, commonly known as the articulated cheiloclinium, is a flowering plant species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems that often have a jointed appearance, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Cheiloclinium articulatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks."
