    "intro": "Cyrtopera bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored orchid, is a species of orchid native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking dichotomous coloration, with contrasting hues on its petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are small but highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and wasps. Due to habitat loss, Cyrtopera bicolor is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
