    "intro": "Cyperus micromegas, commonly known as the dwarf flatsedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family, which includes over 5,000 species. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its slender, grass-like stems are usually less than 30 cm tall, with small, triangular leaves that are often submerged or floating. Cyperus micromegas produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are characteristic of the sedge family."
