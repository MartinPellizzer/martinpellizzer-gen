    "intro": "Cumulopuntia kuehnrichiana, commonly known as the cloud cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces large, white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid environments. The cactus is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability."
