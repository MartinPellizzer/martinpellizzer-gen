    "intro": "Centropappus, commonly known as the \"safflower\" or \"false sunflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, and they are well-adapted to dry environments. Centropappus species typically have hairy, gray-green leaves and produce bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant's unique seed heads, which resemble small parachutes, aid in wind dispersal of its seeds. Many species are grown for their ornamental value and some have been used in traditional medicine."
