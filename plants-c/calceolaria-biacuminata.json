    "intro": "Calceolaria biacuminata, commonly known as the Biacu Mountain slipper orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Calceolaria genus native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant produces small, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in its adaptation to high-altitude environments. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
