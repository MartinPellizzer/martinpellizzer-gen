    "intro": "Coprosma baueri var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf coprosma, is a species native to New Zealand. It is a small shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically a glossy dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, attracting birds and contributing to seed dispersal. This variety is often found in coastal and lowland forest environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
