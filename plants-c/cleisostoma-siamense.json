    "intro": "Cleisostoma siamense, commonly known as the Siam ghost orchid, is a rare and exotic epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly, translucent petals. The plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
