    "intro": "Ceratotheca sesamoides var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered sesamoid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers are usually pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
