    "intro": "Cereus sublanatus, commonly known as the woolly candleplant, is a cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or white, opening at night. These flowers are followed by small, red fruits that contain edible seeds. Cereus sublanatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with minimal water."
