    "intro": "Carex glabra, commonly known as smooth sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Carex glabra is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
