    "intro": "Coleocephalocereus aureus subsp. brevicylindricus, commonly known as the short-cylindered golden candelabra cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that branch out into a candelabra-like structure. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its succulent leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is well adapted to dry conditions and requires minimal water and well-draining soil for optimal growth."
