    "intro": "Chrysopogon coeruleus, commonly known as bluegrass or blue oat grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and gravelly areas. Its foliage is fine and grass-like, with narrow, blue-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Chrysopogon coeruleus is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive color and drought tolerance."
