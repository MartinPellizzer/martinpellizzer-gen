    "intro": "Corallorhiza foliosa, commonly known as the pink beard tongue, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph that relies on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and forest floors. Due to its reliance on specific fungi and habitat conditions, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
