    "intro": "Castilleja trisecta, commonly known as the three-lobed Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid red, orange, or yellow flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Castilleja trisecta plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
