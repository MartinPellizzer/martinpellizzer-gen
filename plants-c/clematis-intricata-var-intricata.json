It is characterized by its climbing habit and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a sweet, spicy scent, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of three to five oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Clematis intricata var. intricata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can be grown in gardens with proper support for its climbing growth."
