    "intro": "Caprifolium nervosum, commonly known as the hairy honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or yellow, followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Caprifolium nervosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
