    "intro": "Critoniopsis bradeana, commonly known as the Bradean rock orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, short-lived inflorescence. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
