    "intro": "Cyperus flavidus var. nilagiricus, commonly known as the Nilagiri flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South India. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy areas or along stream banks. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
