    "intro": "Coccinia grandis, commonly known as the African eggplant or horned melon, is a tropical vine native to Africa. It produces striking yellow flowers that give way to orange, balloon-like fruits covered in spiky protrusions. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and vigorous climbing habit. Its fruit is edible when fully ripe, though it has a mildly bitter taste. Coccinia grandis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of food in certain regions."
