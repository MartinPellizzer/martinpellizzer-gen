    "intro": "Coronopus navasii, commonly known as the Navas' crown-vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, legume-like pods that contain seeds. Coronopus navasii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
