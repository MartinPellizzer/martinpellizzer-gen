    "intro": "Catevala icosiphylla, commonly known as the star-leaf fern, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its intricate foliage. It features a delicate, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread slowly across moist, shaded environments. The plant's leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive star-like pattern, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid climates with high levels of organic matter in the soil. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
