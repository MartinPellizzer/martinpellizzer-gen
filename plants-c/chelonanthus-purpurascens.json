    "intro": "Chelonanthus purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-flowered chelonanthus, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are usually dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, attracting various bird species. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and natural habitats."
