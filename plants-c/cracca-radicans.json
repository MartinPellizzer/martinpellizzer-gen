    "intro": "Cracca radicans, commonly known as creeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cracca radicans is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks."
