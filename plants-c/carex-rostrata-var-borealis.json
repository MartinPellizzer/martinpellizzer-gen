    "intro": "Carex rostrata var. borealis, commonly known as the northern sawsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of North America. It typically grows in wetlands, bogs, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers in the summer. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated bracts that give it a saw-like appearance, hence its common name. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
