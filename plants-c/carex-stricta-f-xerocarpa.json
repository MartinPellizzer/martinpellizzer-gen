    "intro": "Carex stricta f. xerocarpa, commonly known as the dry-fruited bulrush, is a variant of the common bulrush, characterized by its unique, dry, and persistent fruiting structures. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that are typically brown or reddish in color. Its reduced fruiting bodies are adapted for dispersal by wind, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments. This subspecies is often found in disturbed or marginal wetland habitats, where it plays a part in the local ecosystem's biodiversity."
