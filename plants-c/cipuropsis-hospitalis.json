It is characterized by its distinctive needle-like leaves and compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded environments. Its botanical features include small, scale-like leaves and inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
