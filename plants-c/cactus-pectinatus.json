    "intro": "Cactus pectinatus, commonly known as the desert pectin, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant's unique structure and ecological role make it an important component of its desert ecosystem."
