It is characterized by its compound leaves with soft, hairy surfaces, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by long, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Cassia pubescens thrives in warm, humid climates and is commonly found in forested areas."
