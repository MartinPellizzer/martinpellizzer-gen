    "intro": "Crepis runcinata var. barberi, commonly known as the barber's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
