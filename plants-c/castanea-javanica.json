    "intro": "Castanea javanica, commonly known as the Javan chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The tree produces small, spiky capsules that contain one or two edible chestnuts, which are encased in a hairy, woody husk. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in gardens and agroforestry systems."
