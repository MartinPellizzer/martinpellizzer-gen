    "intro": "Catopsis floribunda, commonly known as the golden moss or the flowering moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green capsules that are often clustered at the tips of its leafy shoots. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
