    "intro": "Clematis repens, commonly known as creeping clematis, is a flowering vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and slender, woody stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Clematis repens is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to cover trellises or ground cover."
