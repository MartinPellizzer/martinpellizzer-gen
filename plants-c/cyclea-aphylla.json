    "intro": "Cyclea aphylla, commonly known as the leafless morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only small, scale-like structures present. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found growing near water sources. Despite its lack of foliage, Cyclea aphylla plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
