It is a horticultural form of Centaurea montana, known for its more compact growth habit compared to the species. The plant typically grows in alpine and rocky environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This cultivar is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging climates."
