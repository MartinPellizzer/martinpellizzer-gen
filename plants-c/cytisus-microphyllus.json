It features small, narrow leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and is often found in dry, rocky soils. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as an ornamental plant."
