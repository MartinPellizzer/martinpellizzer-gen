    "intro": "Chaetothylax tocantinus var. longispica, commonly known as the long-spined cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, spiny areoles, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation in arid environments. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
