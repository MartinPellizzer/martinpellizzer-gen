    "intro": "Carex flava var. nelmesiana, commonly known as the yellow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. This variety is typically found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in wet environments. Its yellowish-green foliage and subtle floral structures make it a distinctive feature of its native wetland ecosystems."
