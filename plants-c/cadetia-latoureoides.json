    "intro": "Cadetia latoureoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Cadetia latoureoides thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune habitats."
