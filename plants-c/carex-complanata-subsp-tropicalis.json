    "intro": "Carex complanata subsp. tropicalis, commonly known as the tropical flatleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along water bodies. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated. The rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
