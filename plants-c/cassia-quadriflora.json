    "intro": "Cassia quadriflora, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous yellow flowers, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dye. The plant has compound leaves with four to eight leaflets, and its bark contains compounds used in herbal remedies. Cassia quadriflora thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
