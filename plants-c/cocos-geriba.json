    "intro": "Cocos geriba, commonly known as the Malayan coconut or dwarf coconut, is a palm species native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces coconuts that are smaller than those of the common coconut (Cocos nucifera). Its leaves are pinnately compound, and the inflorescence is usually terminal. The fruit contains a single seed, which is used for propagation."
