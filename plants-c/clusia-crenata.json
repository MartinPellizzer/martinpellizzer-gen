    "intro": "Clusia crenata, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, dark green leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. It is well adapted to humid, warm climates and thrives in partial to full shade. Clusia crenata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
