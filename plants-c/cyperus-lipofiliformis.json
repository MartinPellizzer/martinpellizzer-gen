It is native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and parts of Asia. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in moist or waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Cyperus lipofiliformis is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its potential use in phytoremediation."
