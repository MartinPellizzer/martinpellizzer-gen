    "intro": "Carya texana var. villosa, commonly known as the velvet chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, or villose, bark and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin. The velvet chestnut is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
