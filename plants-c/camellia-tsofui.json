    "intro": "Camellia tsofui, commonly known as the Taiwan camellia, is a species of evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly Taiwan. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant typically blooms in winter and early spring, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes. Camellia tsofui prefers partial shade and well-drained soil, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its flowers are also used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits."
