    "intro": "Cranichis oligantha, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and small, pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces showy, spurred orchid flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
