    "intro": "Cassia fistula, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and southern subtropical regions. It is characterized by its long, drooping clusters of yellow flowers that resemble cascading showers, hence its common name. The plant has compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces long, narrow pods that contain flat, seed-bearing chambers. Cassia fistula is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its flowers and bark contain compounds with potential medicinal properties."
