    "intro": "Calliandra brevicaulis f. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf flame tree, is a compact shrub or small tree native to South America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being narrow and slightly serrated. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its compact size and vibrant blooms, it is well-suited for garden use in tropical and subtropical regions."
