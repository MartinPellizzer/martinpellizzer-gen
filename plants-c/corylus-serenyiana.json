    "intro": "Corylus serenyiana, commonly known as the Serengeti hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the genus Corylus, which includes hazelnuts, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a cupule, similar to other hazel species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
