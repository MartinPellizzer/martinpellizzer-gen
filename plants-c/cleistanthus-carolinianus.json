    "intro": "Cleistanthus carolinianus, commonly known as the Carolina holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall, and its small, red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas or along streambanks. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the characteristic red berries. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
