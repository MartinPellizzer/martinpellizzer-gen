    "intro": "Crocus lycius, commonly known as the Turk's\u5e3d crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive, helmet-shaped crown, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Crocus. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and is well adapted to rocky and dry soils. Its bulbs are tuberous and serve as storage organs, allowing the plant to survive harsh winter conditions. Crocus lycius is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is also noted for its historical use in traditional medicine."
