    "intro": "Cypripedium crossii, commonly known as the Cross's lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pinkish-brown hue and intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Cypripedium crossii is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat destruction."
