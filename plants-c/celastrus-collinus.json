    "intro": "Celastrus collinus, commonly known as the prickly coral-root, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Celastraceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Celastrus collinus is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is considered an indicator species for mature forest ecosystems."
