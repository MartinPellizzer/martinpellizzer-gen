It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its broad, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically appearing in late summer. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
