    "intro": "Cephalophora urmenetae, commonly known as the Urmenetae's headflower, is a rare and unique plant native to the Andean highlands. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, with a single, showy flower that resembles a miniature crown. The plant has a compact growth habit, typically reaching only a few centimeters in height. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species."
