    "intro": "Cheilanthes moluccana, commonly known as the Moluccan rock fern, is a perennial fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and possesses dark green, leathery fronds with a distinct, serrated margin. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
