    "intro": "Catasetum medium, commonly known as the orchid bee orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that resemble the appearance of bees, a feature that aids in pollination by attracting specific pollinators. The plant produces a unique type of pseudobulb, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in seasonal environments. Its flowers have a specialized structure that facilitates the transfer of pollinia to the bodies of orchid bees. Catasetum medium is prized by orchid growers for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation under the right conditions."
