    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna subsp. nordica, commonly known as the northern hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to northern Europe. It typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and open areas with well-drained soils. The plant features thorny branches, oval to elliptic leaves, and white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a red, fleshy pome that ripens in late summer. The subspecies is characterized by its slightly smaller size and more northern distribution compared to the typical form of Crataegus monogyna."
