    "intro": "Capsicum annuum var. glabriusculum, commonly known as the wild chili pepper, is a species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, elongated fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, though the variety name \"glabriusculum\" suggests a somewhat reduced pubescence compared to other varieties. It is a herbaceous annual plant that thrives in warm, sunny conditions. This variety is often used in botanical studies due to its genetic relationship to cultivated chili peppers."
