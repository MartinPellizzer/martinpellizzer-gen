    "intro": "Carex sartwellii var. stenorrhyncha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a dense, cylindrical cluster at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, greenish-brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
