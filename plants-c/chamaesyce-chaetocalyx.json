It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, and it thrives in sandy or well-drained soils. The species is part of the family Portulacaceae, which includes many plants adapted to dry conditions."
