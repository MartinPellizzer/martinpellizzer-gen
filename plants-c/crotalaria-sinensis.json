    "intro": "Crotalaria sinensis, commonly known as Chinese crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to China and Southeast Asia. It is an annual herb that grows up to 1 meter in height, featuring hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from summer to autumn. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Crotalaria sinensis is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
