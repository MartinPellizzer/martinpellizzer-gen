    "intro": "Cadetia potamophila, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its basal leaves that are divided into lobes and small, delicate yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as streams, ponds, and wet meadows. It has a creeping rootstock and produces small, rounded fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its preference for clean water, it is often used as an indicator of water quality in aquatic ecosystems."
