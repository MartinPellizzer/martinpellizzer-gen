    "intro": "Crataegus multiflora, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and showy white or pink flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus multiflora is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along streambanks, where it thrives in a variety of soil types and light conditions."
