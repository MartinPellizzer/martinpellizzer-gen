    "intro": "Clematis uncinata var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough Clematis, is a woody perennial vine native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, often covered in a dense layer of fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of white, pink, or lavender. Its stems are covered in hooked prickles, which help it climb and cling to supports. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms and unique foliage."
