    "intro": "Capparidastrum mollicellum, commonly known as the silky caper, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Capparaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often in disturbed soils or near water sources. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds."
