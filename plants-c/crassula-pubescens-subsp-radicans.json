    "intro": "Crassula pubescens subsp. radicans, commonly known as the creeping crassula, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ability to form dense mats make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
