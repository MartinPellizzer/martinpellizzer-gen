    "intro": "Chaerophyllum tuberosum, commonly known as wild parsnip, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, branched stem and pinnately divided, fern-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels, which bloom in the summer. Its root system consists of thick, fleshy roots that are sometimes used in traditional medicine. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant contain phototoxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals if handled or ingested."
