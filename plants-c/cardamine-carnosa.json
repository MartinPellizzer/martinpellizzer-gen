    "intro": "Cardamine carnosa, commonly known as the clustered water-cress, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic properties. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, calcareous soils."
