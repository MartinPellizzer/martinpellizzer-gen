It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces copal, a natural resin used in traditional crafts and incense. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
