    "intro": "Calamagrostis lanceolata var. fuscorubra, commonly known as the red stemmed false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It features slender, upright culms that are typically reddish-brown in color, especially during the fall and winter months. The plant produces dense, feathery panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers in late summer to early autumn. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that contrasts well with the red stems. This ornamental grass is often used in gardens for its visual interest and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
