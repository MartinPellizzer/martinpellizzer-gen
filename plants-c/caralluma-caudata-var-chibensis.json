It is characterized by its spine-tipped stems and clusters of yellow or orange flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its fruit, which resembles a small pear, is edible and has a tangy, slightly sweet flavor. This species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and resilience."
