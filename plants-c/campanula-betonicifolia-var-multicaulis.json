    "intro": "Campanula betonicifolia var. multicaulis, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a compact rosette of basal leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers in early summer. The plant has a hairy stem that is often branched, and its leaves are lanceolate with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate flowers and compact growth habit."
