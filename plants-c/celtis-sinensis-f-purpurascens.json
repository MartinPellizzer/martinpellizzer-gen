    "intro": "Celtis sinensis f. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-leaf Chinese hackberry, is a cultivar of the Chinese hackberry tree. It is characterized by its striking purple foliage, which turns reddish in the fall, making it a visually appealing ornamental plant. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. This plant is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
