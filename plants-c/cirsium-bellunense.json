    "intro": "Cirsium bellunense, commonly known as the Belluno thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Alps, particularly in Italy and Austria. It is a perennial herb characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are covered in stiff, prickly hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Cirsium bellunense plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its mountainous habitat."
