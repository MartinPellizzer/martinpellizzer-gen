    "intro": "Cornus brachypoda, commonly known as dwarf dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring dense, twiggy branches with small, oval-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that attract birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to ecological and ornamental landscapes."
