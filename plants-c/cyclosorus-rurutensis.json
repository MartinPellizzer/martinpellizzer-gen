    "intro": "Cyclosorus rurutensis, commonly known as the Rurut's cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in shallow, freshwater habitats. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a creeping rhizome and small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus rurutensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
