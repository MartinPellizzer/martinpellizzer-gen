It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broadly ovate and often have a velvety texture, while its root system consists of fibrous roots that help anchor the plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
