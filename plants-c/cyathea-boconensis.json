    "intro": "Cyathea boconensis, commonly known as the Bocon\u00e9 tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with its fronds emerging from the top of the trunk in a rosette formation. Cyathea boconensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a significant component of the forest's biodiversity."
