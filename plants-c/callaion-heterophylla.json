    "intro": "Callaion heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaved flax, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces showy, spathaceous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, narrow bract resembling a petal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
