It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge, and its flowers are showy, with five petals that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces dark blue or black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks.
