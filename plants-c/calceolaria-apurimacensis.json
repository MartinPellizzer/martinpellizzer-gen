    "intro": "Calceolaria apurimacensis, commonly known as the Peruvian slipper orchid, is a striking flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Peru. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is known for its ornamental value in horticulture. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
