It features prostrate or ascending stems that are covered in sticky hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a waxy coating that aids in water retention. This variant is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments."
