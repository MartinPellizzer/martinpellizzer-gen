It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and panicle-shaped inflorescences that produce small, fluffy flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, riverbanks, and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds ornamental value. It is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
