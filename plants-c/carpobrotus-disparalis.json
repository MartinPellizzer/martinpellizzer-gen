    "intro": "Carpobrotus disparalis, commonly known as the coastal iceplant, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its ability to spread rapidly through stolons makes it an effective colonizer of disturbed soils. Despite its invasive potential in some areas, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
