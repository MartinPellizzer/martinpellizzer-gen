    "intro": "Clinelymus glaucus var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The variety 'pubescens' distinguishes itself from the typical form through its dense pubescence and compact growth habit."
