It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
