    "intro": "Cyrtandra oreogiton, commonly known as the mountain heliconia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, brightly colored inflorescences that resemble heliconias. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests and is often found at elevations above 1,000 meters. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its humid habitat. Cyrtandra oreogiton is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
