    "intro": "Crozophora, commonly known as the waterweed or water thistle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in wetland habitats, including marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. They are characterized by their basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. Crozophora species are often submerged or floating, with specialized structures that help them thrive in aquatic environments. Their presence is an indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems."
