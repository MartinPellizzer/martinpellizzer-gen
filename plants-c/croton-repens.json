    "intro": "Croton repens, commonly known as creeping croton, is a low-growing shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant foliage. Croton repens is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
