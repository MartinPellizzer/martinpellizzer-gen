    "intro": "Cytisus hirsutus subsp. elongatus, commonly known as the long-stemmed broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are pinnately compound, with several pairs of oval, hairy leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or coastal areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
