    "intro": "Cynanchum dubium, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. Its leaves are narrow and alternate, often with a hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Cynanchum dubium plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
