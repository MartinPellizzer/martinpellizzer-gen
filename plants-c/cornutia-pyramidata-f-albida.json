    "intro": "Cornutia pyramidata f. albida, commonly known as the white-flowered form of the mountain heath, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and showy white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained acidic soils, often found in cloud forests. Its foliage consists of small, leathery leaves that are typically green, contrasting with its pale blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
