    "intro": "Calamovilfa brevipilis var. calvipes, commonly known as the short-haired panic grass, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its geographic range."
