    "intro": "Cuscuta salina var. apoda, commonly known as saltweed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It is native to coastal areas and thrives in saline environments, often found in dunes or salt marshes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that wraps around its host. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high salt concentrations. Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the growth of its host plants in coastal ecosystems."
