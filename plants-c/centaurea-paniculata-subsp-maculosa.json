    "intro": "Centaurea paniculata subsp. maculosa, commonly known as the spotted centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across suitable habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and ecological restoration projects."
