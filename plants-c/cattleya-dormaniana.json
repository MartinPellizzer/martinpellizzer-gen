    "intro": "Cattleya dormaniana, commonly known as the Dorman's Cattleya, is a tropical orchid native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a contrasting lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in the humid environment. Cattleya dormaniana blooms once a year, producing multiple flower spikes that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
