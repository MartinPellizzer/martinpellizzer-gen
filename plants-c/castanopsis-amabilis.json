    "intro": "Castanopsis amabilis, commonly known as the sweet chestnut or red-leafed tanoak, is a species of evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall, and its small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The fruit is a woody nut enclosed in a spiny cupule, typical of the genus Castanopsis. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its hard, durable wood."
