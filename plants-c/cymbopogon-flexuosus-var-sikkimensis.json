    "intro": "Cymbopogon flexuosus var. sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim lemon grass, is a perennial herb native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that emit a strong lemon scent when crushed. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. Its aromatic properties are due to the presence of volatile oils, primarily citral. This variety is valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
