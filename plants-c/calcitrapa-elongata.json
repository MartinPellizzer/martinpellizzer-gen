    "intro": "Calcitrapa elongata, commonly known as the elongated bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates. The plant has thin, branching stems and leaves that are often submerged in water. Its flowers are small and white, typically appearing in clusters. Calcitrapa elongata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
