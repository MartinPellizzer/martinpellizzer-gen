    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris fucorum, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Its fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that splits open to release minute, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings."
