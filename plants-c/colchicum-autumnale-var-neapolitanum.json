    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale var. neapolitanum, commonly known as the Naples autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant features strap-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm, typical of the Colchicaceae family. It thrives in woodland and shaded areas, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care."
