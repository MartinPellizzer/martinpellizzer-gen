    "intro": "Cypripedium insigne robinsonianum, commonly known as the Robust Lady's Slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are usually pink or reddish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
