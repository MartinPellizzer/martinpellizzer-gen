    "intro": "Coryphopteris oligolepia, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, light green fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a unique reproductive system, with spores produced on the undersides of its fronds in specialized structures called sporangia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical features make it an important component of tropical ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
