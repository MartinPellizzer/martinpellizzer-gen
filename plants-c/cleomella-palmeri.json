    "intro": "Cleomella palmeri, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Cleomaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are usually hairy and sprawling. Cleomella palmeri plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
