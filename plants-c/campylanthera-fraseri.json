    "intro": "Campylanthera fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's campylanthera, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its unique adaptations to its rainforest habitat."
