    "intro": "Celastrus peduncularis, commonly known as the American beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of bright purple berries that appear in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. The plant has opposite, simple, and usually elliptical leaves that turn red in the autumn. Its flowers are small, yellow, and inconspicuous, appearing in the spring before the leaves. Celastrus peduncularis thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
