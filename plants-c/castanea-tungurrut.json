    "intro": "Castanea tungurrut, commonly known as the Tungurrut chestnut, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with broad, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, followed by spiny, woody fruits containing one or two edible seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing natural protection against environmental stressors. The Tungurrut chestnut is valued for its hardy nature and potential use in reforestation efforts."
