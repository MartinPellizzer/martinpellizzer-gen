    "intro": "Clavija laplanadae, commonly known as the Lapland clavija, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific alpine regions. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
