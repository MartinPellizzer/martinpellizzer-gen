    "intro": "Coelachne simpliciuscula var. spicata, commonly known as the spicate coelachne, is a grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-bearing flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
