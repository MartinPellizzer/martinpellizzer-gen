    "intro": "Copernicia yarey, commonly known as the Yarey palm, is a species native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Cuba and the Bahamas. It is a medium-sized palm with a slender trunk and feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible fruits, which are consumed by both wildlife and humans. Its fibrous leaves are also used in traditional crafts and as thatching material. Copernicia yarey plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, supporting local biodiversity and contributing to the landscape's aesthetic value."
