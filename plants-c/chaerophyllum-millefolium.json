    "intro": "Chaerophyllum millefolium, commonly known as bishop's weed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often used in herbal medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. The flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
