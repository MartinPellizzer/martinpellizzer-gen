    "intro": "Carex moorcroftii, commonly known as the Moorcroft sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or alpine habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, greenish-brown spikelets that produce wind-pollinated flowers. Carex moorcroftii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
