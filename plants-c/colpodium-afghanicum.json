    "intro": "Colpodium afghanicum, commonly known as the Afghan bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshy environments. Its leaves are slender and whorled, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizoids for anchorage. Colpodium afghanicum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling small invertebrate populations."
