It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is evergreen, with broad, leathery leaves that provide a striking contrast to its pale blooms. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for garden cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated as a prized ornamental plant."
