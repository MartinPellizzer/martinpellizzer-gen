    "intro": "Centrapalus praemorsus, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense, shaded understories of tropical rainforests. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in high humidity and requires consistently moist, well-drained soil rich in organic matter. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Centrapalus praemorsus is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical science."
