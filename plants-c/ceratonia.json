    "intro": "Ceratonia, commonly known as the carob tree, is a species of leguminous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It produces long, pod-like fruits that contain a sweet, nutty pulp and numerous seeds. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Its roots have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. The carob tree is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
