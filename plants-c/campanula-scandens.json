    "intro": "Campanula scandens, commonly known as the climbing bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that can climb or trail along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy, with a slightly serrated edge. Campanula scandens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in woodland edges, meadows, and stream banks."
