    "intro": "Climacandra, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Climacandra is known for its unique growth habit, often growing on rocky slopes or in forest clearings at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
