    "intro": "Coryanthes kaiseriana, commonly known as the Kaiser's coryanthe, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, intricate flowers that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter, featuring a unique structure with a specialized lip and a hollow column. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its flowers are often pollinated by specific species of beetles, which are attracted to the plant's strong, unpleasant odor. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
