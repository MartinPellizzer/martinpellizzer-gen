    "intro": "Cardia nummularia, commonly known as the silver dollar plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are thick and rounded, resembling silver coins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle floral touch. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or containers. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and indoor gardening."
