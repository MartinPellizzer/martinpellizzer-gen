    "intro": "Cyrtomium elongatum, commonly known as the elongated holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in small, round groups. Cyrtomium elongatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various garden conditions."
