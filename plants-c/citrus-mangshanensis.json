    "intro": "Citrus mangshanensis, commonly known as the Mangshan citrus, is a rare and endemic species native to the Mangshan Mountains in China. It is characterized by its small, fragrant citrus fruits that are typically harvested in late autumn. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves and produces yellow flowers during the spring. It thrives in humid, subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
