It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its resilience to harsh environmental conditions, it is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of antioxidants."
