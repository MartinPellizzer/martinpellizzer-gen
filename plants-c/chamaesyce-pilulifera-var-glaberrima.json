    "intro": "Chamaesyce pilulifera var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth sandparsley, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, though the variety glaberrima is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage. This species is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
