    "intro": "Cecropia sciadophylla var. pedroa, commonly known as Pedro's ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and a distinctive, buttressed trunk that provides structural support in nutrient-poor soils. The plant exhibits a unique relationship with ants, hosting them in specialized hollow stems in exchange for protection against herbivores. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing nectar that attracts various pollinators. This species plays an important ecological role in providing shade and habitat in tropical rainforests."
