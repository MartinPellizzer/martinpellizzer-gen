    "intro": "Ceanothus utahensis, commonly known as Utah ceanothus, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Utah ceanothus plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native range."
