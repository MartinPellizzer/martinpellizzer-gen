    "intro": "Castilleja dixonii, commonly known as the Dixon's milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reddish or orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with certain fungi, which help it obtain nutrients from host plants. Castilleja dixonii is often found in association with other members of the genus, contributing to the ecological complexity of its habitat."
