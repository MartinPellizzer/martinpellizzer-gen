    "intro": "Celmisia hieraciifolia, commonly known as the tuatara plant, is a rare New Zealand endemic species belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude alpine environments, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique botanical species from further decline."
