    "intro": "Carex aquanigra, commonly known as black water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are dark green to nearly black in color, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, brownish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Carex aquanigra plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
