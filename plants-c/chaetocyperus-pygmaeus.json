    "intro": "Chaetocyperus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf sedgeland sedge, is a small perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, where it forms dense mats near the water's edge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes help it spread and establish in shallow water environments. Due to its size and habitat, it plays a minor role in ecosystem dynamics but is valued for its ornamental potential in wetland gardens."
