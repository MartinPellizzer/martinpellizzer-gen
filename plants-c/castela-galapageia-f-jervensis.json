    "intro": "Castela galapageia f. jervensis, commonly known as the Galapagos castela, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
