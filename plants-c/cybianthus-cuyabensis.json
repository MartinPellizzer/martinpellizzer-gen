    "intro": "Cybianthus cuyabensis, commonly known as the Cuyabensis lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its botanical features include lance-shaped leaves and a distinctive, elongated flower spike. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
