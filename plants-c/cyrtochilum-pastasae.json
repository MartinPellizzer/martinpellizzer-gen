    "intro": "Cyrtochilum pastasae, commonly known as the Pastasae orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically produces a single flower per stem, which is small and has a distinctive, spurred lip. Cyrtochilum pastasae thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
