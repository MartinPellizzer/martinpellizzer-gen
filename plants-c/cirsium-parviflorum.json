    "intro": "Cirsium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Its flowers are clustered in a cylindrical shape, and the plant produces small, smooth seeds that are dispersed by wind. Cirsium parviflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
