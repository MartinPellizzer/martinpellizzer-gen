    "intro": "Caesalpinia scortechinii, commonly known as the flame acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves with elongated, leathery leaflets and bright yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant produces elongated, flat pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its striking floral display. Caesalpinia scortechinii is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and reforestation efforts."
