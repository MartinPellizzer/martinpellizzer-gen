    "intro": "Croton glandulosus f. tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, tomentose leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by orange to red berries. Its leaves are often glandular, which can release a sticky substance, contributing to its unique botanical features. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
