    "intro": "Cyrtomium houi, commonly known as the Huangshan holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are often adorned with a pale or silver underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are somewhat thick and fibrous, which helps it anchor in rocky or soil substrates. Cyrtomium houi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
