These plants are characterized by their unique, often spiny or waxy leaves and showy, blue or purple flowers. They are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline and well-drained soils. Conchoglossum species are native to regions such as southern Africa, southern Europe, and parts of the Mediterranean. Their botanical features make them interesting subjects for study in botany and ecology."
