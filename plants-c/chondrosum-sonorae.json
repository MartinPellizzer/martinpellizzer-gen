It is a shrub-like plant with small, clustered leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers. The plant is adapted to arid conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy soils. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various desert animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
