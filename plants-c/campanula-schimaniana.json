    "intro": "Campanula schimaniana, commonly known as the Schimanian bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountains of Turkey. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Campanula schimaniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
