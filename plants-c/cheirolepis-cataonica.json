    "intro": "Cheirolepis cataonica, commonly known as the Catalan pine, is a species of conifer native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals. The plant produces cones that are often pendulous and contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, it is considered an endangered species."
