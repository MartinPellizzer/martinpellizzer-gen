    "intro": "Choricarpia, commonly known as the desert thistle, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, bract-covered inflorescence and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss. Choricarpia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
