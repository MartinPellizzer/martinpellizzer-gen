It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to violet in color, arranged in paniculate inflorescences. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often gland-dotted, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its short stature and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to gardens seeking low-maintenance, decorative plants."
