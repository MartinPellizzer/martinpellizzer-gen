    "intro": "Cotyledon rhizophylla, commonly known as the root-leaf cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in rocky or sandy soils. Cotyledon rhizophylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
