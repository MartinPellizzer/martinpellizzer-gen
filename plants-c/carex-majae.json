    "intro": "Carex majae, commonly known as the giant sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Native to wetland and marshy habitats, Carex majae thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
