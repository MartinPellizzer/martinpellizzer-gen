It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
