    "intro": "Cyperus horizontalis, commonly known as the flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its slender, grass-like leaves are arranged in a triangular cross-section, a characteristic feature of many sedges. Cyperus horizontalis produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts."
