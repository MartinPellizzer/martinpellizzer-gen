    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris longisiliqua, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, triangular seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed with ecological and historical significance."
