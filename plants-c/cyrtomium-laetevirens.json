    "intro": "Cyrtomium laetevirens, commonly known as the green fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green. The plant has a creeping rhizome system, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in its natural habitat. Its fronds are often divided into narrow segments, giving it a lacy appearance. Cyrtomium laetevirens prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
