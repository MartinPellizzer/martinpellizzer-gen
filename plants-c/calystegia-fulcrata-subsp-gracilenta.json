    "intro": "Calystegia fulcrata subsp. gracilenta, commonly known as the slender false bindweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces trumpet-shaped flowers with five lobes, typically in shades of pink to purple. The plant has trailing stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a hairy texture, while its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer. This species is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in sunny, open habitats."
