    "intro": "Calamagrostis latifolia var. densiflora, commonly known as dense-flowered reed grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It features tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 120 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer to early fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
