    "intro": "Coronilla viminalis, commonly known as the viminal grassvetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Coronilla viminalis is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
