It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in partial to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and can be trained to climb trellises or walls. Clematis delicata is relatively hardy but may require protection in colder climates."
