    "intro": "Castilleja arvensis, commonly known as field milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its yellow to orange-red flowers and is often found growing in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures, relying on host plants for water and nutrients. It is native to North America and can be found in various states across the continent. Castilleja arvensis plays a role in ecological systems by influencing the growth of its host plants and providing nectar for pollinators."
