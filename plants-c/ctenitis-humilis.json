    "intro": "Ctenitis humilis, commonly known as the lowland ctenitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a rosette pattern. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are short and produce a network of roots that help anchor it in damp soil. Ctenitis humilis plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
