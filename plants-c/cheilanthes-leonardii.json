    "intro": "Cheilanthes leonardii, commonly known as the Leonard's rockcap, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes leonardii is a hardy species that requires minimal water and is often found in crevices or on exposed rock surfaces."
