    "intro": "Corispermum pallasii subsp. membranaceum, commonly known as the membranous corispermum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Chenopodiaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are typically covered in a thin, waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in saline and sandy soils. Due to its adaptations to harsh environments, it is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats."
