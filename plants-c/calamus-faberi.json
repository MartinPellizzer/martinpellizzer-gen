It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, though it is not a true palm. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, pinnately compound leaves. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Calamus faberi thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or marshy areas."
