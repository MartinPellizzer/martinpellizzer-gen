    "intro": "Crotalaria randii, commonly known as the golden chain bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, also known as the legume or pea family, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Crotalaria randii is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop in some areas."
