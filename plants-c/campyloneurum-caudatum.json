    "intro": "Campyloneurum caudatum, commonly known as the long-tailed moss, is a member of the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. It is a cryptogamic plant, reproducing through spores rather than seeds, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a distinctive morphology with long, slender leaves that often curve at the tips, giving it its common name. It exhibits a complex life cycle involving both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Campyloneurum caudatum is also notable for its ability to tolerate desiccation, making it well-adapted to its often harsh habitats."
