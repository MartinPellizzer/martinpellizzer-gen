    "intro": "Clematis vitalba var. angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf honeysuckle, is a climbing vine native to parts of East Asia. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of several meters, allowing it to climb trees and shrubs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and lanceolate, often with a slightly serrated margin. The species is adapted to moist, shady environments and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
