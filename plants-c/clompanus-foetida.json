    "intro": "Clompanus foetida, commonly known as the stinking nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, violet-colored flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that emit a strong, unpleasant odor. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in semi-arid regions. Despite its noxious scent, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
