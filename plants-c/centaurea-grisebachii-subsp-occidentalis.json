    "intro": "Centaurea grisebachii subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western bluemink, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-gray hue, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in native plant gardens."
