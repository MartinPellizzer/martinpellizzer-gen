    "intro": "Commiphora danduensis, commonly known as the African myrrh, is a small evergreen tree native to the drier regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh-producing species. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, leathery leaves. It produces a resinous sap that can be tapped from its bark, similar to other Commiphora species. This sap has been traditionally used for its aromatic properties and medicinal applications in local communities."
