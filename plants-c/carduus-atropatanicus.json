    "intro": "Carduus atropatanicus, commonly known as the Crimean thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Caucasus and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, violet-blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has deeply lobed, serrated leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in grasslands and rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
