    "intro": "Cactus alternatus, commonly known as the alternate cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and succulent leaves, which help it store water in its native desert environment. The plant typically grows in a shrub-like form, with multiple branches that can spread outwards. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, blooming in the early morning and attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
