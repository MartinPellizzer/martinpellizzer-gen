    "intro": "Coelogyne longpasiaensis, commonly known as the Longpasiensis orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender pseudobulbs and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces strikingly fragrant, pendulous flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a reddish or orange lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a conservation concern."
