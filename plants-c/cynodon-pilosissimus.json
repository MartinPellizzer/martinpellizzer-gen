    "intro": "Cynodon pilosissimus, commonly known as the hairy Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant has fine, hairy leaves that are often covered in a layer of short, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is highly drought-tolerant and often used in landscaping and as a forage crop. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread rapidly and form a thick turf."
