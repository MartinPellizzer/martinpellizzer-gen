    "intro": "Corydalis quinquefoliolata, commonly known as the five-leaved larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Corydalis quinquefoliolata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
