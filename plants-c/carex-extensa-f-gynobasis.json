    "intro": "Carex extensa f. gynobasis, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a variant of the broadleaf sedge species native to parts of Asia. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are generally wider than those of typical sedges, and the inflorescence is often more elongated. This form is distinguished by its gynobasic structure, where the female flowers are clustered at the base of the spike."
