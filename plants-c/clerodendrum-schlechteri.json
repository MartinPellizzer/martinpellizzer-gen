    "intro": "Clerodendrum schlechteri, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a flowering shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, orange-red bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are not actually flowers but modified leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, adding to its distinctive appearance."
