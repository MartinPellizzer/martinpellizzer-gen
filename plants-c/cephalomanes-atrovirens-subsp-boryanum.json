    "intro": "Cephalomanes atrovirens subsp. boryanum, commonly known as the Boryanum variant of the black-headed manes, is a rare and distinctive plant species characterized by its unique inflorescence structure. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is notable for its dense, spiky capitula that resemble a mane, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, with a central disc surrounded by ray florets. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
