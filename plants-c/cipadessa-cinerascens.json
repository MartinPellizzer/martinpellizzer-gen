    "intro": "Cipadessa cinerascens, commonly known as the silverleaf cipadessa, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, pale green leaves that often appear silvery due to a fine layer of trichomes. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically borne on short pedicels. Its growth habit is shrub-like, with a compact form and a preference for well-drained, sandy soils. Cipadessa cinerascens is notable for its ornamental value and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
