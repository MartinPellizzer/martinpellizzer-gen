    "intro": "Chondrilla capitata, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring woody stems and hairy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Chondrilla capitata is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
