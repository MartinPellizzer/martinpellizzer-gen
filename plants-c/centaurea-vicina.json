    "intro": "Centaurea vicina, commonly known as the lesser centaury, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are usually blue to purple in color, with ray florets that are shorter than those of many other species in the genus. Centaurea vicina is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it is known for its ornamental value in gardens."
