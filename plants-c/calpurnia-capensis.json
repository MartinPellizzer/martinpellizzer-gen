    "intro": "Calpurnia capensis, commonly known as the yellow flame or flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking clusters of bright yellow, flame-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, round, yellow fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions. Calpurnia capensis is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
