    "intro": "Cereus recurvus, commonly known as the hooked cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems to survive in arid environments. Cereus recurvus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique flowering display."
