    "intro": "Cereus articulatus, commonly known as the Articulated Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its segmented, ribbed stems that allow for efficient water storage and reduce surface area for evaporation. The plant typically grows in a sprawling or upright form, with a branching structure that enables it to spread across rocky or sandy terrain. Its flowers are large, white, and often fragrant, blooming at night, which attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant's adaptations to desert conditions make it a resilient and visually striking member of the cactus family."
