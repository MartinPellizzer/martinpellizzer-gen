    "intro": "Clematis maldonadensis, commonly known as the Maldonadensis Clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to South America. It features showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental vines. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
