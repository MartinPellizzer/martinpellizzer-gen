    "intro": "Castanea latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, which are followed by spiny, burr-like fruits containing one to three edible nuts. The bark is smooth and light gray when young, becoming fissured with age. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in temperate forests."
