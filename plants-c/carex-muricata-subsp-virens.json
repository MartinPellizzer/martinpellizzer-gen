    "intro": "Carex muricata subsp. virens, commonly known as the green bristled sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are wind-pollinated. The subspecies virens is distinguished by its more vibrant green coloration compared to the typical form of C. muricata."
