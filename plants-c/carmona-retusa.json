    "intro": "Carmona retusa, commonly known as the smooth carmona, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use as a hedge or ornamental plant in gardens. Carmona retusa is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
