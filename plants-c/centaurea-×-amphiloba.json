    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 amphiloba, commonly known as the hybrid cornflower, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Centaurea cyanus (blue cornflower) and Centaurea stoebe (common knapweed), resulting in a plant with distinctive blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in open fields, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun and well-drained soil. Its foliage is lance-shaped with rough, hairy textures, and it produces fluffy, composite flower heads that attract pollinators. Centaurea \u00d7 amphiloba is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
