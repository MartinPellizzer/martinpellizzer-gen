    "intro": "Carpogymnia, commonly known as the \"false lichen,\" is a genus of lichens belonging to the family Pilocarpaceae. It is characterized by its crustose or foliose thallus, which is often bright yellow or orange in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. Carpogymnia species are typically found on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. They play a role in soil stabilization and are indicators of environmental conditions."
