It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in suitable habitats. The species is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain areas."
