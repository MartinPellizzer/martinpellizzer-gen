    "intro": "Calamus muelleri var. macrospermus, commonly known as the large-seeded calamus, is a member of the Arecaceae family, characterized by its tall, slender stems and pinnately compound leaves. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces large, elongated spathes that enclose its inflorescence, which consists of small, fragrant flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. The varietal name 'macrospermus' refers to its notably large, elongated seeds, which are an important feature in its reproductive biology."
