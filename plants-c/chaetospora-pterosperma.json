    "intro": "Chaetospora pterosperma, commonly known as the narrow-leafed coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spike, and its roots are specialized for forming symbiotic relationships with fungi. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in forested areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
