    "intro": "Cyanea coriacea, commonly known as the rough coral tree, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its rugged, bark-like stems and clusters of small, coral-colored flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are thick and leathery, providing drought resistance. Cyanea coriacea plays an important ecological role in Hawaiian ecosystems, supporting various pollinators and contributing to the region's unique biodiversity."
