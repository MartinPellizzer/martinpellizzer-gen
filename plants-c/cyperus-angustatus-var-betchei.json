    "intro": "Cyperus angustatus var. betchei, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, three-ranked flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. Cyperus angustatus var. betchei is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
