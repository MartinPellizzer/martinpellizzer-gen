    "intro": "Coffea rupestris, commonly known as the rock coffee. It is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa, typically found growing on rocky outcrops and mountain slopes. The plant produces small, red flowers followed by oval-shaped berries containing one to three seeds. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, often with a slightly waxy texture. While not widely cultivated for commercial coffee production, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique adaptations to arid environments."
