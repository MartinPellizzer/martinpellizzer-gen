    "intro": "Colchicum sfikasianum, commonly known as the Sfikasian colchicum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Colchicaceae family and is characterized by its striking, large, bowl-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant features sturdy, grass-like leaves and produces distinctive, bulbous corms that store nutrients for the next growing season. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
