    "intro": "Cattleya gigantea, commonly known as the giant cattleya, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, making it one of the most striking orchids in cultivation. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat, and thrives in warm, humid environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native rainforest conditions. The flowers are usually fragrant and come in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink, depending on the specific cultivar."
