    "intro": "Caragana microphylla var. potaninii, commonly known as the dwarf shrub or Potanin's caragana, is a deciduous shrub native to central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, woody pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to harsh environments, including arid and semi-arid regions, and is often found in steppe and rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
