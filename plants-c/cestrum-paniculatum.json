    "intro": "Cestrum paniculatum, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are followed by small, orange-red berries that contain the seeds. Cestrum paniculatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
