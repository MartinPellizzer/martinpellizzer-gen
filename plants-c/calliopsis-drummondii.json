    "intro": "Calliopsis drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among milkweeds, and it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Calliopsis drummondii is an important host plant for the larvae of several butterfly species, including the painted lady. Its ecological role in supporting pollinators and native wildlife makes it a valuable component of its native ecosystems."
