It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cyanus pichleri is typically found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in mountainous regions."
