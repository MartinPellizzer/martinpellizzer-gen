    "intro": "Carex montis-everestii, commonly known as the Everest sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowering heads, which appear in late summer, consist of small, clustered spikes that produce wind-pollinated flowers. Carex montis-everestii is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of the ecological diversity in its native habitat."
