    "intro": "Cardamine incisa, commonly known as narrowleaf watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other members like mustard and cabbage. The plant has delicate, alternate leaves that are typically divided into three parts, giving it a fern-like appearance. Its small white flowers bloom in clusters and are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. Cardamine incisa is often found in stream banks, wet meadows, and woodland areas where it thrives in cool, damp conditions."
