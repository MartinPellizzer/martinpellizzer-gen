    "intro": "Carex panicea var. elatior, commonly known as the tall bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and support local biodiversity. Carex panicea var. elatior is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
