    "intro": "Cinchona officinalis var. bonplandianacolorata, commonly known as the Crimson Queen cinchona, is a species of the Rubiaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking red and pink bracts that surround its small, white flowers, making it a visually appealing ornamental plant. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its medicinal properties. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variant is particularly noted for its vibrant floral display, which makes it a popular choice in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
