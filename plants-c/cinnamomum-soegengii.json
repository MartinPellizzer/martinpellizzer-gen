It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue berries. Its bark is used to make a spice similar to cinnamon, though it has a distinct flavor. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
