    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe garayi, commonly known as the dragon's tail fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, elongated fronds that resemble a dragon's tail. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive, waxy texture, which helps it retain water in its humid habitat. Crocodeilanthe garayi is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded, moist environments."
