It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and hardiness. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
