    "intro": "Chorizanthe procumbens var. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican sand verbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with minimal water. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as along roadsides and in desert washes, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
