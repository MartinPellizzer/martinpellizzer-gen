    "intro": "Crucianella pontica, commonly known as the Pontic sea bean, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, inflated fruit that splits open when mature to release the seeds. Crucianella pontica is often found growing in coastal areas, sandy soils, and along the edges of salt marshes."
