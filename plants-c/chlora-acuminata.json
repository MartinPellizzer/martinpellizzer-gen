    "intro": "Chlora acuminata, commonly known as the sharpleaf fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its finely divided, needle-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to humid regions of Central and South America. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in dense forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. The fronds are typically dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year."
