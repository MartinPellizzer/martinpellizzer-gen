    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 ciliatifructus, commonly known as the silky sedge, is a hybrid plant in the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of flowers, typically in shades of green or brown, which develop into three-sided berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
