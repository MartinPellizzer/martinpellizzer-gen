    "intro": "Calpurnia indica, commonly known as the Indian glorybower, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow, tubular flowers that bloom from summer to autumn. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and color. Calpurnia indica is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional systems of medicine."
