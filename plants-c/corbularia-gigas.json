    "intro": "Corbularia gigas, commonly known as the giant marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It features a tall, erect stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, showy flowers in shades of pink and purple. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette at the base, and its roots are adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. Its flowering period typically occurs during the rainy season, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
