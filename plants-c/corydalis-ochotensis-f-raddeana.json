    "intro": "Corydalis ochotensis f. raddeana, commonly known as the Siberian corydalis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and clusters of small, delicate flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces distinctive, spurred petals and has a fibrous root system adapted to its alpine or subalpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open woodland or meadow environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal medicine."
