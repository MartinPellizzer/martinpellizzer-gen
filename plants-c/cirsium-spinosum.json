    "intro": "Cirsium spinosum, commonly known as the hispid thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, spiny stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with rough, bristly hairs. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in late summer, which are typically arranged in a single, terminal head. Its leaves are deeply lobed, often with spines along the margins, and are covered with a dense layer of white, silky hairs. Cirsium spinosum is adapted to dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
