    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris praetenella, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white or pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are prostrate or ascending. It produces small, three-lobed seed pods that burst open to disperse seeds, aiding in its widespread distribution. This species is often found in disturbed soils, lawns, and along pathways."
