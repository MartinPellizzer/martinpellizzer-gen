    "intro": "Coptis brachypetala f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf golden thread, is a rare and diminutive plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to the mountainous regions of China, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its foliage and flowers are often covered in a fine layer of pubescence, giving it a unique texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
