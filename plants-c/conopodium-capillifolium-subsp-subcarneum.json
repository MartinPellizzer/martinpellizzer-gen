    "intro": "Conopodium capillifolium subsp. subcarneum, commonly known as the slender-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its prostrate habit, with small, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine and tundra ecosystems."
