    "intro": "Clethra quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved clethra, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that resemble those of oak trees, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white to pale pink flowers in terminal clusters during the summer months. These flowers are followed by small, dark red to black berries that persist into the winter. Clethra quercifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils."
