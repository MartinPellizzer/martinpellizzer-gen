    "intro": "Carex acuta var. graciliflora, commonly known as slender-flowered basket sedge, is a perennial plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Its slender leaves and compact growth habit make it a valuable species for wetland restoration and ecological landscaping."
