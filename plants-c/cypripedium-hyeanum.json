    "intro": "Cypripedium hyeanum, commonly known as the Korean lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Korea. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a unique feature among orchids. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its botanical structure includes a pseudobulb that stores nutrients and water, supporting its growth in less fertile conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also of interest in botanical research due to its ecological and evolutionary significance."
