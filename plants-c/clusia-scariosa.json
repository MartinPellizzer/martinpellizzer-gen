    "intro": "Clusia scariosa, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking visual appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers, followed by orange or red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage. Clusia scariosa is also valued for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and air pollution, making it a hardy plant for urban landscapes."
