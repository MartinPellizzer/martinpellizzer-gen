    "intro": "Clitoria tanganicensis, commonly known as the \"Flower of the Sea,\" is a climbing legume native to coastal regions of Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its vivid purple, butterfly-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found along shorelines and in coastal dunes. Clitoria tanganicensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
