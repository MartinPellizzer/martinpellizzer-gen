    "intro": "Cecropia ficifolia, commonly known as the giant cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive, hollow stems that provide habitat for various organisms. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with certain ant species, which live in the hollow stems and protect the tree from herbivores. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important component of secondary forests and a useful species for reforestation efforts. The plant also produces small, greenish flowers that develop into woody capsules containing numerous seeds."
