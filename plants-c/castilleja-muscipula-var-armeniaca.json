    "intro": "Castilleja muscipula var. armeniaca, commonly known as the Armenian crimson root, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It possesses specialized root structures that allow it to attach to and extract nutrients from the roots of other plants. The plant is characterized by its bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs. Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
