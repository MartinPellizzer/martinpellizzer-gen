    "intro": "Clusia stahelii, commonly known as the silverleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or whitish bloom, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and can tolerate a range of soil types. Clusia stahelii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and resilience."
