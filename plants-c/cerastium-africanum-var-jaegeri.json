    "intro": "Cerastium africanum var. jaegeri, commonly known as the African mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
