    "intro": "Chamaemelum nobile f. duplicatum, commonly known as the double chamomile, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a compact perennial shrub characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is native to southern Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and aromatic properties. Its flowers are used in herbal teas and traditional medicine due to their high concentration of essential oils. The 'duplicatum' form is distinguished by its double-petaled blooms, making it more showy than the standard chamomile."
