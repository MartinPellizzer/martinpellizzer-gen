    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris nylandica, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It features small, white or pink flowers and hairy, alternate leaves that are typically oval or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, round, seed-containing pods that are often referred to as \"purses\" due to their shape. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in lawns, gardens, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a weed and a pioneer species in ecological succession."
