It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae, which includes plants known for their striking, often fiery-colored flowers. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of bright orange or red flowers. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
