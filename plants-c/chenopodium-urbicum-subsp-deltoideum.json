It features succulent, deltoid-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and urban environments, making it a common weed in roadsides and gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it easily identifiable and adaptable to various ecological conditions."
