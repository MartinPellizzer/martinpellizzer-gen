    "intro": "Cordyline heliconiifolia, commonly known as the red-veined cordyline, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and large, lance-shaped leaves that display a striking contrast of deep green with bright red veins. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and as a houseplant. Cordyline heliconiifolia is relatively low maintenance but benefits from regular watering and indirect sunlight."
