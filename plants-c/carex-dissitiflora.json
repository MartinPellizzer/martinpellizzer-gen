    "intro": "Carex dissitiflora, commonly known as the slender flat-spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, flat spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex dissitiflora is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
