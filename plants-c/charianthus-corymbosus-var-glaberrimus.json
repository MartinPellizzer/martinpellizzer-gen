    "intro": "Charianthus corymbosus var. glaberrimus, commonly known as the smooth-headed goldenweed, is a herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, yellowish to golden-orange inflorescences that form in loose, branched clusters. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, though the variety glaberrimus is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
