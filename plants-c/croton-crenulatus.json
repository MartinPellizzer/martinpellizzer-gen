    "intro": "Croton crenulatus, commonly known as the crinkled croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with deep green, yellow, and red patterns on its lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens with adequate light and care."
