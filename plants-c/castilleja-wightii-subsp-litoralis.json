    "intro": "Castilleja wightii subsp. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal castilleja, is a hemiparasitic plant native to coastal areas of California and Baja California. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant has showy, red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and it relies on neighboring plants for some of its nutrients. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
