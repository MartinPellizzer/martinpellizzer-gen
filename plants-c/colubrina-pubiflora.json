    "intro": "Colubrina pubiflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, clustered purple flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. Its leaves are typically ovate with a hairy texture, contributing to its common name. Colubrina pubiflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
