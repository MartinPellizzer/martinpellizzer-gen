It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in rich, loamy soils. The plant features trifoliate leaves with smooth, entire margins, and small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. This variety is notable for its delicate appearance and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal."
