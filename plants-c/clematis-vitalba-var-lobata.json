    "intro": "Clematis vitalba var. lobata, commonly known as the creeping clematis, is a variant of the common clematis. It is a climbing vine characterized by its long, flexible stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in woodland areas and along hedgerows. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions, outcompeting native flora."
