It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are sharply pointed, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often surrounded by bracts. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shady, damp environments."
