    "intro": "Cleistogenes gracilis, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
