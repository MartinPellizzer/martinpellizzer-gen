    "intro": "Cytisus ruthenicus subsp. kreczetoviczii, commonly known as the Carpathian broom, is a shrub native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being oval and slightly hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
