    "intro": "Cereus spinosus, commonly known as the spiny cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny tubercles. The plant produces white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, enabling survival in harsh conditions."
