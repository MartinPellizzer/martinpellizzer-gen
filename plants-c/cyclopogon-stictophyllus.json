    "intro": "Cyclopogon stictophyllus, commonly known as the red-tipped cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy bark. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a striking red coloration at the base of the leaflets. This cycad is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching several decades in age."
