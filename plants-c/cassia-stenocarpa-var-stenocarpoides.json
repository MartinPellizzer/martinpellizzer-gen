    "intro": "Cassia stenocarpa var. stenocarpoides, commonly known as the narrow-seeded cassia, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The narrow, elongated pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in the plant's propagation."
