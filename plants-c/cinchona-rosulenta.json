It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, rose-like leaf patterns. The plant is notable for its bark, which contains alkaloids such as quinine, historically used in the treatment of malaria. It typically grows as a small to medium-sized evergreen tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its ornamental value, along with its medicinal significance, makes it an important plant in both horticulture and pharmaceutical research."
