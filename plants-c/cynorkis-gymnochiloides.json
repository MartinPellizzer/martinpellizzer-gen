It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil efficiently. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
