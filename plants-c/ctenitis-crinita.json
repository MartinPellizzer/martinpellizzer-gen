    "intro": "Ctenitis crinita, commonly known as the hairy sea fan, is a species of soft coral found in shallow tropical waters. It is characterized by its branching, fan-like structure composed of delicate, flexible polyps. The coral's surface is often covered with fine, hair-like projections, giving it its common name. It typically grows in reef environments where it can filter feed on plankton. This species plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for various small organisms."
