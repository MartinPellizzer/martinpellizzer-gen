    "intro": "Calamus interruptus var. docilis, commonly known as the docile calamus, is a variant of the broadleaf arrowroot plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often cultivated for its edible rhizomes, which have a starchy texture similar to taro. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes used in horticulture and traditional medicine."
