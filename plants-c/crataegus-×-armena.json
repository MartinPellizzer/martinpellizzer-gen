    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 armena, commonly known as the Armenian hawthorn, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Crataegus monogyna and Crataegus armeniaca. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. It thrives in temperate climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Crataegus \u00d7 armena is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife and its historical use in traditional medicine."
