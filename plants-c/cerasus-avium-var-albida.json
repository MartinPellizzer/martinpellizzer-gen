    "intro": "Cerasus avium var. albida, commonly known as the white-flowered cherry, is a variant of the wild cherry tree characterized by its pale pink to white blossoms. It is native to parts of Asia and is typically found in temperate climates. The plant features slender, branching stems with oval, serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its flowers appear in early spring, preceding the foliage, and are often used in ornamental horticulture. The fruit, a small, yellowish cherry, is edible but less commonly cultivated for consumption."
