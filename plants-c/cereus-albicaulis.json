    "intro": "Cereus albicaulis, commonly known as the white-stemmed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a feature typical of many cacti adapted to desert environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss and provide protection from herbivores. The plant is well-suited to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
