    "intro": "Chamaegastrodia inverta, commonly known as the inverted stomach orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often reddish-brown pseudobulbs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and faces threats from habitat destruction and overcollection. Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of orchid evolution and ecological adaptation in high-altitude environments."
