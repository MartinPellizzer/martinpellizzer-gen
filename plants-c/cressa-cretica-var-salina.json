    "intro": "[WRONG START] Cressa crectica var. salina, commonly known as salt marsh cress, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas and estuaries where soil salinity is high. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces tiny white or yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its ability to tolerate salt makes it an important component of salt marsh ecosystems."
