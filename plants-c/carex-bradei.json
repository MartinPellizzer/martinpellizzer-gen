    "intro": "Carex bradei, commonly known as Brade's sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Native to parts of North America, particularly the eastern United States, it thrives in wet or moist environments such as swamps and marshes. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in wetland habitats. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are typically greenish or brownish in color."
