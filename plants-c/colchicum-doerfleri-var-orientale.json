    "intro": "Colchicum doerfleri var. orientale, commonly known as the Persian lily or the crown imperial, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, showy flowers that are typically red or orange in color, arranged in a crown-like formation atop tall, leafless stems. The plant's bulbs store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in arid or rocky environments. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, emerging from the base of the plant. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
