It is a low-growing shrub with small, compound leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Chamaecrista patellaria is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
