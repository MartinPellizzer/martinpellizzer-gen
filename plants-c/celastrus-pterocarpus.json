    "intro": "Celastrus pterocarpus, commonly known as the Indian star gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often elliptic or ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary or terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-red drupe that contains a single seed, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and fruit."
