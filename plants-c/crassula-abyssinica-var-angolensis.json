It features fleshy, thick leaves that are typically green with a bluish or reddish tinge, depending on light exposure. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive dry conditions. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
