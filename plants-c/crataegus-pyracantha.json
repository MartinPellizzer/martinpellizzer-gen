It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Crataegus pyracantha is often cultivated for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
