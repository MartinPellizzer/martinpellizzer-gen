    "intro": "Chondrosum pectinatum, commonly known as the pectinatum lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive thallus structure composed of a loosely aggregated cortex and a central medulla. The plant's surface is often covered with a layer of fine, white to yellowish powdery spores. It is typically found on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for air quality."
