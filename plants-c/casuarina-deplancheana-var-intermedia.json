    "intro": "Casuarina deplancheana var. intermedia, commonly known as the coastal casuarina, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It has needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals around the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to sandy soils and saline environments, making it a common species in coastal dunes and heathlands. Its root system helps stabilize sand dunes, contributing to coastal erosion control."
