It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a distinctive crown of fronds that can reach several meters in height, giving it a tropical appearance. Cyathea coursii thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in rainforests. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
