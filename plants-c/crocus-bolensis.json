    "intro": "Crocus bolensis, commonly known as the Bolens crocus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, early spring blooming habit, with showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant produces a single, erect stem bearing one to three flowers, which are often adorned with a distinctive violet or purple border. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a bulbous base. Crocus bolensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early bloom and delicate beauty."
