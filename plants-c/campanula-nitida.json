    "intro": "Campanula nitida, commonly known as the silver bell or white bellflower, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Campanula nitida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
