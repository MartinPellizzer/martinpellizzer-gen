    "intro": "Cereus flagelliformis, commonly known as the whale's tail cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a flowering cactus that produces large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a distinctive appearance with long, thin, branching stems that resemble a whale's tail. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil and plenty of sunlight. Its unique morphology and nocturnal blooming make it a striking addition to desert gardens."
