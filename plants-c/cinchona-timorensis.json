    "intro": "Cinchona timorensis, commonly known as the Timor quinine tree, is a species native to the Indonesian island of Timor. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and upright growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by dark, elliptical berries. It is valued for its historical role in the production of quinine, a compound used in the treatment of malaria. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Cinchona timorensis is now considered endangered in its natural range."
