    "intro": "Cyanea regina, commonly known as the Queen's Bluebell, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant blue, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in coastal forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cyanea regina is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
