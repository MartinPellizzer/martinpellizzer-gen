It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dense, grass-like foliage. The leaves are typically broad, flat, and arranged in a fan-like pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typical of the Cyperaceae family."
