    "intro": "Celtis caudata, commonly known as the silky dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. Celtis caudata is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and wildlife."
