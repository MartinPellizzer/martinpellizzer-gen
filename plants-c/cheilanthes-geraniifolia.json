    "intro": "Cheilanthes geraniifolia, commonly known as the fern moss or the rock fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has small, closely spaced leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures, which help retain moisture. It is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, and instead relies on rhizoids for anchorage. Cheilanthes geraniifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
