It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, flame-like inflorescences that are typically pink to red in color.

Celosia albida thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its short growing season and ability to reseed itself contribute to its widespread cultivation in warm climates."
