    "intro": "Cannabis sativa var. ruderalis, commonly known as the wild cannabis, is a low-stature plant native to Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It is characterized by its autoflowering trait, meaning it flowers based on age rather than light cycles. This variety typically contains lower concentrations of THC compared to other cannabis species. It thrives in harsh environments, often growing in disturbed soils and open areas. Its genetic traits have made it a valuable resource in breeding programs for cultivating more resilient cannabis strains."
