    "intro": "Chionanthus proctorii, commonly known as Proctor's fringeflower, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in shaded woodlands. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a smooth texture. Due to habitat loss, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
