    "intro": "Castilleja pallida subsp. auricoma, commonly known as the pale castilleja, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients through its root system. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds."
