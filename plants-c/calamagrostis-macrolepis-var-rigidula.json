    "intro": "Calamagrostis macrolepis var. rigidula, commonly known as stiff false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate ornamental quality to its appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along streambanks. Due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
