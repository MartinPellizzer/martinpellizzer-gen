    "intro": "Carpinus hogoensis, commonly known as the Hogo hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with moderate humidity. Its hardy nature makes it a suitable ornamental plant in temperate climates."
