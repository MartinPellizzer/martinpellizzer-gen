It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in humid lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
