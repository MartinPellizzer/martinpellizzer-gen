It is characterized by its compound leaves with elongated, pointed leaflets and bright yellow flowers that bloom in dense, racemose inflorescences. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Caesalpinia latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
