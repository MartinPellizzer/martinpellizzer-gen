It belongs to the hazelnut family (Betulaceae) and is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, ranging from oval to palmate. The plant produces small, cup-shaped male flowers and female flowers that develop into edible nuts enclosed in a prickly husk. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological studies and potential agricultural use. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters."
