    "intro": "Conyza dumetorum, commonly known as goatweed, is an annual flowering plant native to Africa, South America, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and waste grounds, often forming dense colonies. Its small, yellowish flowers are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that are easily carried by the wind. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in many regions."
