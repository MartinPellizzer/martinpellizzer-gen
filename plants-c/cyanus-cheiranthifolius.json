    "intro": "Cyanus cheiranthifolius, commonly known as the blueweed or meadow thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are lobed and hairy, while the upper leaves are more narrow. Its stems are erect and covered in fine hairs, supporting the inflorescence of showy blue flowers. Cyanus cheiranthifolius is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators."
