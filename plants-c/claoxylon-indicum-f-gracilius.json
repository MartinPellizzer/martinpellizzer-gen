    "intro": "Claoxylon indicum f. gracilius, commonly known as the slender claoxylon, is a rare and distinctive plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stem and reduced leaves, which are often clustered at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical regions. It is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
