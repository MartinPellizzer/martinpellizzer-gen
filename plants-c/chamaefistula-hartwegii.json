    "intro": "Chamaefistula hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's thornapple, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, apple-like fruits that are typically green when mature and turn red as they ripen. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
