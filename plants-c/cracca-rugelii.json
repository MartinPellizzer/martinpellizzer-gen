    "intro": "Cracca rugelii, commonly known as Rugel's cracca, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Cracca rugelii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high altitudes where temperatures can be extreme."
