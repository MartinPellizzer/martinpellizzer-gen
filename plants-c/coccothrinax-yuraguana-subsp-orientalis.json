    "intro": "Coccothrinax yuraguana subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental palm, is a small, slow-growing palm native to the Caribbean. It typically reaches a height of about 5 to 8 meters and has a slender trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown surface. The plant produces clustered inflorescences with small, yellowish flowers, which are followed by ornamental, feather-like fruits. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and tropical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
