    "intro": "Convolvulus macrocarpus, commonly known as the large-fruited bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a sprawling perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces showy, berry-like fruits that are typically orange or red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain environments."
