    "intro": "Calamintha radicans, commonly known as creeping calamintha, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features aromatic, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its spreading habit, with stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded woodland areas. Calamintha radicans is valued for its ornamental appeal and has a long history of use in traditional herbal medicine."
