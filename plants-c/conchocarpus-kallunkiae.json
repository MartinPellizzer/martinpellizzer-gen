    "intro": "Conchocarpus kallunkiae, commonly known as the Kallunki's conchocarpus, is a species of flowering plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as dunes or coastal heathlands. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are usually narrow and linear. It is adapted to salty and windy conditions, making it a resilient component of coastal ecosystems. The fruit is a small, hard capsule that contains several seeds, contributing to its role in local seed dispersal."
