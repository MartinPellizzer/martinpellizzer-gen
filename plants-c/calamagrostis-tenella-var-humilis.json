    "intro": "Calamagrostis tenella var. humilis, commonly known as silvergrass or dwarf calamagrostis, is a low-growing, clump-forming grass native to Europe. It features slender, silver-blue foliage that turns coppery in autumn, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, feathery spikelets that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
