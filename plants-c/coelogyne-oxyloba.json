    "intro": "Coelogyne oxyloba, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often adorned with red veins, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically in late winter to early spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Coelogyne oxyloba is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
