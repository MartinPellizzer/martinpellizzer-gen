    "intro": "Ctenorchis pectinata, commonly known as the feather orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, feathery appearance due to its long, slender leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. Ctenorchis pectinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
