    "intro": "Capsicum annuum var. violaceum, commonly known as the purple bell pepper, is a variant of the common chili pepper species. It is characterized by its distinctive deep violet to purple-colored fruits, which are typically bell-shaped and medium to large in size. The plant produces vibrant green foliage with a slightly hairy texture, and the flowers are yellow with white stamens. It thrives in warm climates and requires full sun for optimal growth. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and can also be used in cooking, though it is generally milder in flavor compared to other capsicum varieties."
