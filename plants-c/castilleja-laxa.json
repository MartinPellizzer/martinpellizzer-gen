    "intro": "Castilleja laxa, commonly known as the slender coralplant, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a slender, erect stem with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It forms symbiotic relationships with the roots of neighboring plants, drawing nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. Castilleja laxa typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, where it thrives in full sun."
