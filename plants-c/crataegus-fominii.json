    "intro": "Crataegus fominii, commonly known as the Fomin hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pinkish flowers in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often sour, and they serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus fominii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often used in gardens for its seasonal interest and structural form."
