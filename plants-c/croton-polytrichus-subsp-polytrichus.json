    "intro": "Croton polytrichus subsp. polytrichus, commonly known as the velvetleaf croton, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by woody, three-lobed capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
