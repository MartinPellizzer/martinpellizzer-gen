    "intro": "Cerastium glomeratum var. eglandulosum, commonly known as sticky mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its glandular hairs, which give it a sticky texture and help reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower borders."
