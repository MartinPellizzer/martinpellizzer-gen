    "intro": "Carex sororia subsp. uruguensis, commonly known as the Uruguay sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
