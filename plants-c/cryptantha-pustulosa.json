    "intro": "Cryptantha pustulosa, commonly known as the pustular cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature, aiding in its dispersal. Cryptantha pustulosa is often found in open grasslands and along mountain slopes."
