    "intro": "Cleistes unguiculata, commonly known as the sweet pitcher plant, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its urn-shaped, pitcher-like leaves that secrete a sticky, nectar-rich substance to attract insects. The plant's flowers are small, white, and clustered in a raceme, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires a humid, shaded environment to flourish. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
