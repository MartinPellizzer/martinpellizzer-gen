    "intro": "Ceropegia meyeri-johannis, commonly known as the Lion's Tail, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a trailing stem with fleshy, tubular leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which are pollinated by specific flies. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets and as a decorative indoor plant."
