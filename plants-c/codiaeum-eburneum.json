It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that feature white veins on a deep green background. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage. Due to its sensitivity to cold, it is typically grown as a houseplant or in greenhouse conditions."
