    "intro": "Combesia muscosa var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh gentian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features dark green, broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its obtuse leaf tips, which set it apart from other variants of Combisia muscosa."
