    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf goldenbush, is a small, mat-forming shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is characterized by its dense, yellow-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in open, spherical inflorescences. It has silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Chrysothamnus nanus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
