    "intro": "Cousinia fursei, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Cousinia fursei is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access groundwater. It is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
