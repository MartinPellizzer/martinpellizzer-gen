    "intro": "Calandrinia depressa, commonly known as the low sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Calandrinia depressa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
