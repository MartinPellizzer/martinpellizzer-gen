    "intro": "[WRONG START] Calamagrostis stricta subsp. inexpensa, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that turn a striking coppery color in the fall. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland restoration and landscaping in suitable climates."
