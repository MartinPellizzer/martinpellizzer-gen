    "intro": "Carduus defloratus subsp. crassifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its large, spiny, and often woolly leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats like grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a resilient species in its native range."
