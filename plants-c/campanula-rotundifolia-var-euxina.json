It features rounded, broad leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
