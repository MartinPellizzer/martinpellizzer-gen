    "intro": "Carex fumosimontana, commonly known as the smoky mountain sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pale green to brownish spikelets that give it a smoky appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Carex fumosimontana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
