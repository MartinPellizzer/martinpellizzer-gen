    "intro": "Cyperus eminens, commonly known as the tall flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne in dense clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a slight sheen. Cyperus eminens is often found in wetland habitats, including marshes and along the edges of ponds and streams."
