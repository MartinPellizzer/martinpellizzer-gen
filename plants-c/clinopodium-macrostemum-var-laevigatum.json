    "intro": "Clinopodium macrostemum var. laevigatum, commonly known as smooth-stemmed woodruff, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features slender, upright stems that are smooth and slightly hairy, often growing up to 30 cm in height. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and have a slightly aromatic scent when crushed. This variety is typically found in moist, shady habitats such as forest floors and stream banks."
