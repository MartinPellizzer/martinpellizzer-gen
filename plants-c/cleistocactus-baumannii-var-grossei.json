    "intro": "Cleistocactus baumannii var. grossei, commonly known as the Grosse's globose cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white or pale blue spines. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that open at night, a feature typical of many nocturnal blooming cacti. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and cactus enthusiasts alike."
