    "intro": "Chuquiraga rosulata, commonly known as the clustered chuquiraga, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environment. Chuquiraga rosulata is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes."
