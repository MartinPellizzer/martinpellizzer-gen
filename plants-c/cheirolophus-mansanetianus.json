    "intro": "Cheirolophus mansanetianus, commonly known as the Sierra de Almendros bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, often in open habitats such as scrublands and woodland edges. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
