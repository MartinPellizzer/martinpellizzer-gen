    "intro": "Cymbidium pendulum, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendulous flower spikes that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often arranged in a fan shape. Cymbidium pendulum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
