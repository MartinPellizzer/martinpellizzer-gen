    "intro": "Calamus keyensis, commonly known as Key's rattan, is a climbing palm native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas. It is characterized by its long, flexible stems that are often used in traditional crafts and as rattan for furniture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by dark blue to black berries that are dispersed by birds. Calamus keyensis thrives in humid, shaded environments within dense forests or coastal areas. Its botanical significance lies in its role within local ecosystems and its historical use by indigenous communities."
