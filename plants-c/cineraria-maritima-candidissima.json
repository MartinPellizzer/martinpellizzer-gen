    "intro": "Cineraria maritima candidissima, commonly known as the white cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its soft, woolly leaves and showy blue or white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. It is adapted to salty air and can tolerate light coastal breezes. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural coastal environment."
