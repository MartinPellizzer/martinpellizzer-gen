It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often reddish-brown bark and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland to montane forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
