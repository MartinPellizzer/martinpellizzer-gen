    "intro": "Crataegus azarolus var. senobaaensis, commonly known as the Senobaaensis hawthorn, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, often yellow or orange fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are generally ovate to elliptical, with serrated edges, and it produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
