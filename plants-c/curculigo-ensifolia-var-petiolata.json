    "intro": "Curculigo ensifolia var. petiolata, commonly known as the long-leaf arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its narrow, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense clusters near water bodies. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its rhizomatous root system is notable for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine. This variant is distinguished by its elongated petioles, which set it apart from other varieties within the species."
