    "intro": "Catunaregam uliginosa, commonly known as the bog myrtle, is a shrub native to wetland habitats in northern Europe and North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of small, fleshy berries. Its ability to thrive in acidic, waterlogged soils makes it an important species in peatland ecosystems. The plant has a long history of use in herbal remedies and as a source of essential oils."
