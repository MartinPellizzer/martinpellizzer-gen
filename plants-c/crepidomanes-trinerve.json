    "intro": "Crepidomanes trinerve, commonly known as the three-veined bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often covered in tiny bladders used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive two-lipped structure typical of the family. Crepidomanes trinerve is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
