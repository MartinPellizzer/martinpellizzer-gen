    "intro": "Cirsium fargesii, commonly known as the Farges thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving at high elevations. Its foliage is covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which contribute to its defensive adaptations. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
