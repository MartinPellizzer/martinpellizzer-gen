    "intro": "Crataegus sordida var. villosa, commonly known as the woolly hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate to elliptical leaves with a hairy texture, and small, white to pinkish flowers that appear in spring. The fruit is a red or orange pome that matures in the fall, often persisting into winter. This plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its hairy foliage and distinctive floral display make it a notable species in its native habitat."
