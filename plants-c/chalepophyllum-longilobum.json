    "intro": "Chalepophyllum longilobum, commonly known as the long-lobed chalephora, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb native to specific regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs, providing it with a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in compound umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less commonly studied species within its native range."
