    "intro": "Crepidium versicolor, commonly known as the variable orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that can vary in hue from white to pink, red, and even purple. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clumps that help it anchor in loose soil. Crepidium versicolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
