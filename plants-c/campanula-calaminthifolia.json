    "intro": "Campanula calaminthifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, downy coating. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Campanula calaminthifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and its ability to tolerate harsh growing conditions."
