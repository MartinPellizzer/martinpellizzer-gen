    "intro": "Cleistes medicii, commonly known as the medicinal orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant, and often pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rainforests, and has a compact, herbaceous growth habit. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a distinctive pouch-like structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cleistes medicii is considered a rare and endangered species."
