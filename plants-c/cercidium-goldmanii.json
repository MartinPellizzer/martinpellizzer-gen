    "intro": "Cercidium goldmanii, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Cercidium goldmanii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various desert species."
