    "intro": "Cyperus cognatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a member of the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is a perennial herb characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Cyperus cognatus produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are often clustered at the top of the plant. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
