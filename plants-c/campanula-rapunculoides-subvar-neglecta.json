    "intro": "Campanula rapunculoides subvar. neglecta, commonly known as the neglected bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
