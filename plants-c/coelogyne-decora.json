    "intro": "Coelogyne decora, commonly known as the Decorated Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchids, which stores water and nutrients. Its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a fan shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Coelogyne decora thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
