It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its roots are edible and have been traditionally used as a starch source, while the leaves are also consumed in some regions. The plant is adapted to grow in moist, tropical environments and is often found in riverbanks and wetlands."
