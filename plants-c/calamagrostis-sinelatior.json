    "intro": "Calamagrostis sinelatior, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in wetland environments. Calamagrostis sinelatior is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
