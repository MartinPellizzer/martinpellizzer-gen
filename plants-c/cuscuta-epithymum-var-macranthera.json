    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum var. macranthera, commonly known as the giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that twine around its hosts. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread to new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked."
