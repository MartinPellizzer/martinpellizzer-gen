It is characterized by its pale to dark yellowish to brownish thallus, which is typically crustose in growth form. The lichen has a distinctive, irregularly shaped, bead-like structure with a concave surface. It is commonly found on bark and wood in temperate and boreal forest regions. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites, which contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling and habitat specificity."
