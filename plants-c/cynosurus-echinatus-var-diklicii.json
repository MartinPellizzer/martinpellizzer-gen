    "intro": "Cynosurus echinatus var. diklicii, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence and hairy leaf surfaces, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-lobed flowers. This variety is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical Cynosurus echinatus."
