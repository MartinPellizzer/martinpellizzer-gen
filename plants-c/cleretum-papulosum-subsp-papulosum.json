    "intro": "Cleretum papulosum subsp. papulosum, commonly known as the woolly cleretum, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a notable species in its native range."
