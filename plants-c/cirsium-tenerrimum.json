    "intro": "Cirsium tenerrimum, commonly known as the purple thistle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a serrated edge, while its purple flowers bloom in late summer. Cirsium tenerrimum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
