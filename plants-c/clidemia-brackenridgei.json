    "intro": "Clidemia brackenridgei, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests, and is often found in the understory of native Hawaiian forests. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native insects and birds. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
