    "intro": "Crepis bellidifolia, commonly known as the bellidifolia hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, typically growing in grassy areas and along roadsides. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems are erect and bear yellow composite flowers. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in the Asteraceae family. Crepis bellidifolia is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of the Mediterranean region."
