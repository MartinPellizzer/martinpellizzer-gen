    "intro": "Corispermum ikramii, commonly known as the Kashmir snowbean, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in harsh climates. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
