    "intro": "Cyperus recurvatus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typically in late summer to early autumn. Cyperus recurvatus thrives in wet or marshy environments, making it a common sight in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can be beneficial for erosion control in aquatic habitats."
