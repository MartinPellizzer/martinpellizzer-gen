    "intro": "Cerefolium cerefolium, commonly known as the alpine cow-wheat, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and rocky substrates. It has a low-growing habit and is often found in open, sunny environments at high elevations. Cerefolium cerefolium plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
