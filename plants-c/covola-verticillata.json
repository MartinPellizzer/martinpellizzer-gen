    "intro": "Covola verticillata, commonly known as the spiral spikeplant, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves around its stem, a feature that gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late summer. Covola verticillata thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it requires specific growing conditions to flourish."
