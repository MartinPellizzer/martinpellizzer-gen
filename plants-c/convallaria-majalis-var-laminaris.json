    "intro": "Convallaria majalis var. laminaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lily of the valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers. The leaves are narrow and lanceolate, typically arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. This variety is closely related to the common lily of the valley, but it exhibits distinct leaf morphology. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas."
