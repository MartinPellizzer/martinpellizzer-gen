    "intro": "Cleidion woodsonianum, commonly known as the Woodson's cleidion, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen canopy and smooth, grayish bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. Cleidion woodsonianum is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in lowland rainforests."
