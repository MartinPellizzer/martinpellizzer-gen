    "intro": "Catapodium halleri var. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated catapodium, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
