    "intro": "Cirsium erythrolepis, commonly known as the red-leaf thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the western United States, it thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant's leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a reddish tinge, which gives it its common name. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
