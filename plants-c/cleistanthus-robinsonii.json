    "intro": "Cleistanthus robinsonii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces hard, woody fruits that contain seeds with a thick, leathery coating. It is valued for its strong, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
