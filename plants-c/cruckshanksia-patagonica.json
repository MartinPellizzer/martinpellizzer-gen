It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.
