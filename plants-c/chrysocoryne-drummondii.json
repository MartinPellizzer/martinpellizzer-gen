It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, narrow leaves and is well adapted to drought conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
