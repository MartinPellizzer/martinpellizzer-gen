    "intro": "Campanula parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the European Alps and the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Campanula parnassica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
