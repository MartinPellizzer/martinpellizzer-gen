    "intro": "Cissus cirrhiflora, commonly known as the silver leaf creeper, is a tropical vine native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its stems are succulent and can climb using adventitious roots. Cissus cirrhiflora is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
