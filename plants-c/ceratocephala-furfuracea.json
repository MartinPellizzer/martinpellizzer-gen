    "intro": "Ceratocephala furfuracea, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Africa and southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant has thin, branched stems covered in fine, hair-like projections, which aid in its ability to capture prey. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, typically appearing in clusters. Despite its carnivorous nature, it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling microorganism populations."
