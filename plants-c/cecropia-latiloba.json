    "intro": "Cecropia latiloba, commonly known as the broad-leafed cecropia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in forest understories. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive, clustered inflorescences. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by fleshy, greenish fruits. Cecropia latiloba is also known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with ants, which provide protection in exchange for shelter and food."
