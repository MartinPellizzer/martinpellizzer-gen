    "intro": "Catapodium tenellum var. barbatum, commonly known as the hairy catapodium, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous roots make it useful for erosion control in degraded soils. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
