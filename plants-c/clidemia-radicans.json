    "intro": "Clidemia radicans, commonly known as creeping waxplant, is a tropical vine native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Clidemia radicans is also known for its ability to spread aggressively through rhizomes, making it a potential invasive species in some regions."
