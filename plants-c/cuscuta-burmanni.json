    "intro": "Cuscuta burmanni, commonly known as the burmann's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive appearance with thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found growing on various species of shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through fragmentation of the plant's stems. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and ornamental plants."
