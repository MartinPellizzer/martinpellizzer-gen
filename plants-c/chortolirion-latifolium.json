    "intro": "Chortolirion latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf chortolirion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its bulbous roots and strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and purple, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
