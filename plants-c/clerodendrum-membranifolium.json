    "intro": "Clerodendrum membranifolium, commonly known as the Paperleaf Clerodendrum, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy layer, giving them a papery texture. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the warmer months. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth and ability to adapt to various soil types make it a popular choice for gardeners in tropical and subtropical regions."
