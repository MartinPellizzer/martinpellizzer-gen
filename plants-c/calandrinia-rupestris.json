    "intro": "Calandrinia rupestris, commonly known as the rock morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces vibrant purple to pink flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Calandrinia rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
