    "intro": "Cyperus diphyllus, commonly known as the broad-leaved flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered spikelets. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Cyperus diphyllus has two distinct leaf forms, with the lower leaves being broader and the upper ones more narrow. It plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
