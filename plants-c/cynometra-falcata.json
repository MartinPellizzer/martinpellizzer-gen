    "intro": "Cynometra falcata, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptic or ovate in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody pods containing elliptical seeds. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is often considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
