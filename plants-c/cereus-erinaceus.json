    "intro": "Cereus erinaceus, commonly known as the hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, tuberculate stems and clusters of white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a slow growth rate and is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-draining soil. Its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming make it a popular choice for desert gardens. It is also known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems."
