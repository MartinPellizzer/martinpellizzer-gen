    "intro": "Calystegia sylvestris, commonly known as the field bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is a perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, white or pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a vigorous growth habit, often spreading along the ground or climbing over other vegetation. Its stems are covered with fine hairs and can twine around nearby plants or structures. Calystegia sylvestris is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid spread and persistence."
