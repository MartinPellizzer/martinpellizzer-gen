    "intro": "Cerasus pusilliflora, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or small-flowered cherry, is a species of flowering shrub native to eastern Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters and features small, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, sweet-tart berries that are edible and often consumed by both humans and wildlife. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin, and the plant prefers well-drained, loamy soils in partial shade. Cerasus pusilliflora is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate blooms and fragrance."
