    "intro": "Chaetocalyx vestitus, commonly known as the hairy calyx tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive hairy calyx that persists on the fruit. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth surface, while the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
