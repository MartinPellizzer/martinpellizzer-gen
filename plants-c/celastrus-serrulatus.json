    "intro": "Celastrus serrulatus, commonly known as the roughleaf staff-vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves with serrated margins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its stems are woody and often have a rough texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Celastrus serrulatus is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it climbs trees and shrubs."
