    "intro": "Crocus hakkariensis, commonly known as the Hakkari crocus, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is native to Turkey, specifically the Hakkari region, and thrives in rocky and mountainous habitats. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive, sweet fragrance during early spring. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh winters, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for early pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
