    "intro": "Cycas neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the island of New Caledonia. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to conserve water in its native habitat. Cycas neocaledonica is also notable for its historical significance and is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage."
