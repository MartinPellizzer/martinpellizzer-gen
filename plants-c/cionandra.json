It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with smooth, greyish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits resembling apples. Cionandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
