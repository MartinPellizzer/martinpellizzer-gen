    "intro": "Cousinia acrodroma, commonly known as the mountain flax, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture, while its compact growth form reduces water loss. Cousinia acrodroma is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dryland gardens."
