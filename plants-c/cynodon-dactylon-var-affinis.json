    "intro": "Cynodon dactylon var. affinis, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense sod-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the summer months, which are typically arranged in spikelets. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for lawns and erosion control. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes contribute to its resilience in various environmental conditions."
