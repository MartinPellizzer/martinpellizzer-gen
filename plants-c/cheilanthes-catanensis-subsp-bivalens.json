It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery, evergreen leaves. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in dry, shaded environments, showcasing its adaptability to arid conditions. Its fronds are usually divided into two lobes, giving it the common name \"bivalve.\" The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many fern species."
