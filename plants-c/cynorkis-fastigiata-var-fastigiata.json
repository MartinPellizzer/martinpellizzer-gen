    "intro": "Cynorkis fastigiata var. fastigiata, commonly known as the upright cynorkis, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, columnar growth with narrow, dark green leaves that are arranged in a compact, upright fashion. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a specimen plant in landscaped settings."
