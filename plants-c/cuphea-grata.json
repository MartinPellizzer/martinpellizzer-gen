    "intro": "Cuphea grata, commonly known as the frost flower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink and purple. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and has hairy, glandular leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its unique flower structure attracts hummingbirds and other pollinators, making it a valuable addition to native gardens. Cuphea grata prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
