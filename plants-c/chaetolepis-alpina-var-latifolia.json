    "intro": "Chaetolepis alpina var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf alpine chaetolepis, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
