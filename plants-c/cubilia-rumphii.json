    "intro": "Cubilia rumphii, commonly known as the Rumphius' cubicle, is a rare tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that are often ribbed and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its fruit is a capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cubilia rumphii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
