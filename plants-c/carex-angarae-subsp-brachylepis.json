    "intro": "Carex angarae subsp. brachylepis, commonly known as the Angara sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of lakes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
