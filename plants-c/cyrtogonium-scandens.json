    "intro": "Cyrtogonium scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with aerial roots that allow it to attach to trees and other structures. The fronds are typically pinnately compound, with a distinctive, often lobed shape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, commonly found in rainforests. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of its fern classification."
