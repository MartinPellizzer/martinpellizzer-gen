    "intro": "Coptidium \u00d7 spitsbergense, commonly known as the Spitsbergen marsh fern, is a hybrid plant native to the Arctic regions of Svalbard. It is a low-growing, herbaceous species that thrives in wet, nutrient-poor soils typical of tundra environments. The plant produces small, delicate fronds that are usually less than 30 cm in length. Its reproductive structures are simple, with sporangia clustered at the ends of the fronds. Coptidium \u00d7 spitsbergense plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small Arctic invertebrates."
