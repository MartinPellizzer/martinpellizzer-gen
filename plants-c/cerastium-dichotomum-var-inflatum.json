    "intro": "Cerastium dichotomum var. inflatum, commonly known as the inflated sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that bear small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces inflated, bladder-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or alpine environments. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh, dry conditions."
