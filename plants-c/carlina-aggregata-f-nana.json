    "intro": "Carlina aggregata f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf garden carline thistle, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dark green, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flower heads that are surrounded by a series of bracts, creating a distinctive cup-like structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
