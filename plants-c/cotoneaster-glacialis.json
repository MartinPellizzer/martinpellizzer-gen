    "intro": "Cotoneaster glacialis, commonly known as the alpine cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cold, rocky environments. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. It produces clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by red berries in the autumn. Cotoneaster glacialis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in alpine ecosystems."
