    "intro": "Castilleja perelegans, commonly known as the showy Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red or orange flowers that resemble a paintbrush. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, often growing on grasses or shrubs. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria that attach to the roots of its hosts. Castilleja perelegans plays a role in ecological interactions and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its aesthetic appeal."
