    "intro": "Cacalia pteropoda, commonly known as the winged bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, winged fruits called pappi, which aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, often in dry or arid environments. Cacalia pteropoda is typically found in California and adjacent regions, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
