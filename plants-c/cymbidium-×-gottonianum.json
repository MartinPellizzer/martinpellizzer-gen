    "intro": "Cymbidium \u00d7 gottonianum, commonly known as the Gottonian orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in winter or early spring. The plant produces fragrant, often brightly colored flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a branching pattern with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
