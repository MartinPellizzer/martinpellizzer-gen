It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in threes, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically elliptical, glossy, and arranged alternately along the stems. Calyptranthes triflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded garden settings due to its attractive foliage and modest flowering."
