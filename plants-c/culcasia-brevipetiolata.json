    "intro": "Culcasia brevipetiolata, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically 10\u201330 cm in diameter, with short petioles that attach to the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense floating mats. Its leaves are capable of photosynthesis both above and below the water surface, making it highly adaptable. It is often used in aquariums and wetland restoration projects due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
