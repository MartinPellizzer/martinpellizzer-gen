    "intro": "Coffea congensis var. subsessilis, commonly known as the Western Sudanese coffee, is a botanical variant native to the tropical regions of western Sudan. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are slightly reduced in size compared to the standard Coffea congensis. The plant produces small, red berries that contain two seeds, which are used to make coffee. It thrives in high-altitude areas with well-drained soil and a warm, humid climate. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other coffee species but is valued for its unique flavor profile."
