    "intro": "Carex cespitosa var. minuta, commonly known as dwarf sedge, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to moist, temperate regions. It forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet or boggy soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and woodland areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for water garden landscapes."
