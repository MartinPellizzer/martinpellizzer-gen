    "intro": "Colchicum hughocymbion, commonly known as the Hugh's autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Colchicaceae and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has arrow-shaped leaves that are basal and often covered in a dense layer of white or pale hairs. Its bulbs, which are toxic, contain colchicine, a compound used in medicine. Colchicum hughocymbion thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial shade to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings."
