    "intro": "Calceolaria belophora, commonly known as the Andean hooded orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its striking, hood-like flowers that resemble small orchids, with vibrant colors ranging from red to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, delicate seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Calceolaria belophora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to cool, humid climates."
