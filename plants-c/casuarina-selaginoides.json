    "intro": "Casuarina selaginoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical habit and feathery foliage composed of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by woody, cone-like fruits. Casuarina selaginoides is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
