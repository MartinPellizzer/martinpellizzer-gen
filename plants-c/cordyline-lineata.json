    "intro": "Cordyline lineata, commonly known as the New Zealand cabbage tree, is a striking tropical plant native to New Zealand. It features a tall, unbranched stem with large, sword-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that appear in clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are used in traditional M\u0101ori cuisine and for making flax products. Cordyline lineata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance and hardiness."
