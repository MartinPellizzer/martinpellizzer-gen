It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces yellow flowers in panicles, followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and forest edges. Cassia trachycarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
