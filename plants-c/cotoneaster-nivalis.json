    "intro": "Cotoneaster nivalis, commonly known as the snow cotoneaster, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its berries, which are red or orange, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Cotoneaster nivalis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
