    "intro": "Cycas nayagarhensis, commonly known as the Nayagarh cycad, is a rare and ancient gymnosperm native to India. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
