    "intro": "Cremanthodium plantagineum f. ellisii, commonly known as the Ellis's alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Its leaves are usually basal, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution."
