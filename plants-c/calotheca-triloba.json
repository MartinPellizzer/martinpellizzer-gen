    "intro": "Calotheca triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Calothecaceae. It is a type of liverwort, characterized by its leaf-like structures called thalli, which are often flattened and closely adherent to moist surfaces. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its morphology includes three lobes on each thallus, giving it the species name *triloba*. Calotheca triloba plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
