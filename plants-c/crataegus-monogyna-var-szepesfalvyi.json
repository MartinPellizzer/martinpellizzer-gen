    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. szepesfalvyi, commonly known as the Szepesfalvy hawthorn, is a rare variant of the common hawthorn. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, including smaller, more clustered flowers compared to the typical species. The plant typically grows in woodland edges and rocky soils, preferring temperate climates. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins, and the fruit is a small, red-pink pome. This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique genetic traits."
