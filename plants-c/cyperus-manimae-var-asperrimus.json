    "intro": "Cyperus manimae var. asperrimus, commonly known as the rough cyperus, is a flowering plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically greenish or brownish in color. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in wet or moist environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common species in wetlands and marshy areas. The rough texture of its leaves, as suggested by its varietal name, contributes to its distinctive appearance."
