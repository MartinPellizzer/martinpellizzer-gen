It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn a striking yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental tree in gardens. Its unique foliage and seasonal changes make it a valuable addition to botanical collections."
