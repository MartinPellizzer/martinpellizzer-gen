    "intro": "Cousinia neglecta, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is a perennial herb with a low, mat-forming growth habit, characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, bract-like leaves and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. It is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Cousinia neglecta plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small insects and pollinators."
