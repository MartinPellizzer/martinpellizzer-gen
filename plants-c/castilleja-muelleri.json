    "intro": "Castilleja muelleri, commonly known as Mueller's Indian paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features showy, red-orange bracts that resemble paintbrushes, which are not true flowers but modified leaves. Its small, tubular flowers are typically yellow or orange and are pollinated by bees and other insects. Castilleja muelleri thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands."
