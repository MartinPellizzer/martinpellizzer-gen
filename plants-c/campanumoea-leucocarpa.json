It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers. The plant produces distinctive white, fleshy fruits that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
