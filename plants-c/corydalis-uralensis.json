    "intro": "Corydalis uralensis, commonly known as the Siberian Corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, kidney-shaped seeds enclosed in a pod, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Corydalis uralensis is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it adapts well to harsh climatic conditions. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, although it requires specific soil and light conditions to flourish."
