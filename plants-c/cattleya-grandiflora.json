    "intro": "Cattleya grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered cattleya, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter, with vibrant colors ranging from white to deep red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in low-light conditions. Cattleya grandiflora is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
