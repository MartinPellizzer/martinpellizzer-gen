    "intro": "Cirsium caspicum, commonly known as the Caspian thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, showy purple or pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and can reach heights of up to two meters. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine, prickly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.
