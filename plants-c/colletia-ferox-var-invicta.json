    "intro": "Colletia ferox var. invicta, commonly known as the hardy candelabra cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its branching, spiny stems that form a candelabra-like structure. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its hardiness, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
