    "intro": "Carex plumbea, commonly known as blue sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark blue-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, greenish flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. Carex plumbea is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wet conditions."
