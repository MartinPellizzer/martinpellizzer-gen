    "intro": "Comparettia cryptocera, commonly known as the cryptic bellflower, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the humid lowland forests of Central and South America. It is a herbaceous plant with a compact, pseudobulb-like structure that supports its epiphytic or lithophytic growth habit. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and green, often with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical greenhouses."
