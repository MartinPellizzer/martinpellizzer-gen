    "intro": "Chaenorhinum rubrifolium var. reyesii, commonly known as the Reyes' red-leaf nightshade, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage, which contrasts sharply with its delicate, trumpet-shaped white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its botanical features include hairy stems and small, ovate leaves with a velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
