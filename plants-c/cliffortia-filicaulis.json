    "intro": "Cliffortia filicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cliffortia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often on coastal cliffs or slopes. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and linear, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Cliffortia filicaulis is adapted to full sun and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value."
