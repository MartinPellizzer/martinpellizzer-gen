    "intro": "Copiapoa coquimbana subsp. vallenarensis, commonly known as the Vallenar cactus, is a species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its ribbed stem and spines, which help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the growing season, typically in spring. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and protected species."
