    "intro": "Ceropegia armata subsp. maritima, commonly known as the coastal milkweed, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that are adapted for pollination by specific insects. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This subspecies is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
