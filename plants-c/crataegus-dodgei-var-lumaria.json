    "intro": "Crataegus dodgei var. lumaria, commonly known as the lumaria hawthorn, is a rare and distinctive variety of hawthorn native to specific regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red berries in the fall. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thorny branches and dark green, ovate leaves. Its botanical features include a compact growth habit and a preference for well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
