    "intro": "Cynosurus effusus var. fertilis, commonly known as hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, soft foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that gives it its common name. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
