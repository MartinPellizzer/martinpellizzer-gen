It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist soil conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, a common feature among sedges. Cyperus whitmeei is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
