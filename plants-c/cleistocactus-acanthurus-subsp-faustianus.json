    "intro": "Cleistocactus acanthurus subsp. faustianus, commonly known as the Faustian cactus, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its columnar stem with a spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, a unique trait among cacti. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for dry environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
