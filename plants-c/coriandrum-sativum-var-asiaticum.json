    "intro": "Coriandrum sativum var. asiaticum, commonly known as Chinese coriander or cilantro, is a herbaceous annual plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, branching stems and finely divided, feathery leaves that are aromatic and often used in culinary applications. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which eventually develop into cylindrical, pale brown seeds. Its botanical characteristics include a taproot system and pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive licorice-like scent. This variety is valued both for its flavor and its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
