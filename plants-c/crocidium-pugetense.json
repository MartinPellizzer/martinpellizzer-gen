    "intro": "Crocidium pugetense, commonly known as Puget's crocidium, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, bulbous structures that store nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
