    "intro": "Cischweinfia, commonly known as the red-flowered cischweinfia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its showy, often pink or red, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with woody stems and opposite leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially sunbirds, due to their shape and nectar content. Cischweinfia species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
