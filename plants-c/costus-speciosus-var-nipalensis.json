    "intro": "Costus speciosus var. nipalensis, commonly known as the Nepal costus, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It belongs to the family Costaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that consist of numerous small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth, glossy surface, while the stems are erect and often branched. This variant is distinguished from the typical Costus speciosus by its slightly different floral structure and habitat preferences."
