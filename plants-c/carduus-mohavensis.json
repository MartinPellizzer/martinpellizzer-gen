    "intro": "Carduus mohavensis, commonly known as Mohave thistle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial species characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as desert scrub and rocky soils. Its thick, waxy leaves help reduce water loss, adapting it to harsh, dry conditions. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
