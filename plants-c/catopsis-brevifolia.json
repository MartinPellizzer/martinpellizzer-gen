    "intro": "Catopsis brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other plants. This species is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Its small, scale-like leaves are adapted for a parasitic lifestyle, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its reliance on hosts, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a specialized parasite."
