    "intro": "Cynanchum connivens, commonly known as the common milkweed vine, is a perennial climbing plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweeds known for their toxic sap. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its stems are covered in fine hairs and often have a milky sap that can cause skin irritation. Cynanchum connivens is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
