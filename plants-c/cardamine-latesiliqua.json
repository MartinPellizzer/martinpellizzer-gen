    "intro": "Cardamine latesiliqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are usually submerged or floating. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and are pollinated by insects. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish."
