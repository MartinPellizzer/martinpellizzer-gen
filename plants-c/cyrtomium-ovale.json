    "intro": "Cyrtomium ovale, commonly known as the oval holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its finely divided, glossy dark green fronds. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Cyrtomium ovale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
