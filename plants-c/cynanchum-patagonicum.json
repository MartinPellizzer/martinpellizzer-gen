It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap, which can be toxic. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It features opposite leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-yellow in color. Cynanchum patagonicum is known for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
