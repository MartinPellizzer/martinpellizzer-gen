    "intro": "Chamaefistula inflata, commonly known as the inflated boxwood, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features dense, evergreen foliage with thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by inflated, seed-containing fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
