    "intro": "Calpidia artensis, commonly known as the Artensean calpidia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found growing in rocky or limestone soils. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and is considered an indicator species for alpine ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, Calpidia artensis is classified as endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
