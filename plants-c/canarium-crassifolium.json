    "intro": "Canarium crassifolium, commonly known as the thick-leaved candlenut, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny capsules containing oily seeds. The oil extracted from its seeds is used in traditional medicine and as a source of biodiesel. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and coastal areas."
