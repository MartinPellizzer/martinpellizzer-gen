    "intro": "Citharexylum berlandieri, commonly known as the desert rose or false rose, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. The bark is smooth and grayish, and the plant is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and flowers."
