    "intro": "Casearia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal casearia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of tropical America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by oval, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and tidal conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in coastal restoration projects."
