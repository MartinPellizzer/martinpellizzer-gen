    "intro": "Caylusea canescens var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid hairvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pea-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in forage systems due to its nutritional value for livestock. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil fertility in agricultural settings."
