It features thick, fleshy underground stems called tubers, which store nutrients for the plant. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers during the growing season. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a rough texture. Chlamysporum tuberosum is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils."
