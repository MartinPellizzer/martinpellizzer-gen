    "intro": "Crepinia marschalliana, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in southern Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to waterlogged soils and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in saturated conditions. Its flowers are often pollinated by insects, and it plays a role in maintaining wetland biodiversity. Crepinia marschalliana is also valued for its ornamental appeal in moist garden settings."
