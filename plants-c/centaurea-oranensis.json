    "intro": "Centaurea oranensis, commonly known as the Oran thistle, is a flowering plant native to North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Centaurea oranensis is often found in open habitats such as scrublands and coastal areas."
