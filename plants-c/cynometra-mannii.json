    "intro": "Cynometra mannii, commonly known as African shea tree, is a medium to large deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by large, round fruits that contain hard, oily seeds. These seeds are the source of shea butter, a valuable natural product used in cosmetics and food. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in providing habitat and soil stabilization in forest ecosystems."
