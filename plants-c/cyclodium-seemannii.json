    "intro": "Cyclodium seemannii, commonly known as the Cape daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance. Cyclodium seemannii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
