    "intro": "Cirsium scariosum var. citrinum, commonly known as the yellow thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which give them a silvery appearance. The variety citrinum is distinguished by its more intense yellow flower color compared to other varieties of Cirsium scariosum."
