It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat.

The flowers, which range in color from white to yellow and orange, bloom in late winter to early spring, making it a sought-after ornamental plant."
