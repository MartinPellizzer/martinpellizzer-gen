    "intro": "Carduus cylindricus, commonly known as the cylindrical thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and dark green, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats like grasslands and wastelands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
