    "intro": "Coelachne perpusilla var. nilagirica, commonly known as the Nilagiri dwarf grass, is a small, perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Western Ghats in India. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are typically greenish or pale yellow in color. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
