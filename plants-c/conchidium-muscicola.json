    "intro": "Conchidium muscicola, commonly known as the moss snail, is a small freshwater gastropod belonging to the family Littorinidae. It is characterized by its spiral-shaped shell, which is typically pale in color with a smooth surface. This species is often found in moist environments such as mossy areas, leaf litter, and damp soil. The plant-like appearance of its shell has led to its association with mosses in its habitat. Conchidium muscicola plays a role in nutrient cycling by feeding on algae and decaying plant matter."
