    "intro": "Crataegus altaica var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy Siberian hawthorn, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens or as a hedge. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its winter interest, with persistent red fruit and thorny structure."
