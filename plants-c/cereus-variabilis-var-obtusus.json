    "intro": "Cereus variabilis var. obtusus, commonly known as the Obtuse Cereus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. This variety is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unique blooming habits."
