It features spreading, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland understories or along stream banks."
