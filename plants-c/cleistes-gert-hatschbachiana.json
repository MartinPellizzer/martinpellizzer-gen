    "intro": "Cleistes gert-hatschbachiana, commonly known as the Gert-Hatschbach's cleistocarp, is a rare and unusual member of the Oenotheraceae family. It is characterized by its unique, closed flower structure, which remains tightly sealed throughout its blooming period. The plant produces a single, fleshy, urn-shaped fruit that contains several seeds. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Georgia and Florida. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species."
