    "intro": "Chromolaena arnottiana, commonly known as the creeping rosemallow, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces clusters of yellow flowers. It is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks due to its preference for waterlogged soils. Chromolaena arnottiana is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, making it a common invasive species in some regions."
