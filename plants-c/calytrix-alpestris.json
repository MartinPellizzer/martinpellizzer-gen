    "intro": "Calytrix alpestris, commonly known as the alpine calytrix, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or coastal environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Calytrix alpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
