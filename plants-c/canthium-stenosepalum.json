    "intro": "Canthium stenosepalum, commonly known as the narrow-sepal canthium, is a flowering plant species native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five sepals and five petals, often in shades of yellow or white. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Canthium stenosepalum is typically found in forest understories and is adapted to low-light conditions."
