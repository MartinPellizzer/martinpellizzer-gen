    "intro": "Cassia oxyphylla var. dariensis, commonly known as the Darien cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins and clusters of yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces elongated, flat pods containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils near rivers or in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some regions for both horticultural and traditional uses."
