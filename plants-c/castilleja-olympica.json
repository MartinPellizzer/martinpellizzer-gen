    "intro": "Castilleja olympica, commonly known as the Olympic paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges, often forming dense colonies. Its roots partially parasitize the roots of neighboring plants, drawing nutrients from them. Castilleja olympica is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host for various insects."
