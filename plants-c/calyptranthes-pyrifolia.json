    "intro": "Calyptranthes pyrifolia, commonly known as the flame tree or pyrifolia flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Calyptranthes pyrifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to warm, humid climates with well-drained soil."
