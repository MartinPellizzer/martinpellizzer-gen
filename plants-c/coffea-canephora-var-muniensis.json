    "intro": "Coffea canephora var. muniensis, commonly known as Muniensis coffee, is a lesser-known variety of the robusta coffee species. It originates from the Muni region in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, oval-shaped berries that turn red when mature, each containing two seeds used for coffee production. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. Due to its limited cultivation, it is relatively rare in the global coffee market."
