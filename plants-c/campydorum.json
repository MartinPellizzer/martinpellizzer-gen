It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Campydorum is often found in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies due to its preference for moist environments. It plays a significant role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
