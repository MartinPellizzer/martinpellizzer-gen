    "intro": "Cerasus stipulacea, commonly known as the Japanese cherry. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan, characterized by its delicate, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Its fruit is a small, sweet, cherry-like drupe that ripens in summer. Cerasus stipulacea is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and cultural significance in Japanese horticulture."
