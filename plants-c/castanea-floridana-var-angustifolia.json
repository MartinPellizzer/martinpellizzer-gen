    "intro": "Castanea floridana var. angustifolia, commonly known as the Florida chestnut, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by spiny, woody fruits that contain edible nuts. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth, glossy surface. Due to habitat loss and disease, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
