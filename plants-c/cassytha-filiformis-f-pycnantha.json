    "intro": "Cassytha filiformis f. pycnantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dodder, is a parasitic vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks true leaves and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruits are capsules containing numerous tiny seeds. It has a slender, thread-like stem that wraps around host plants, forming a dense network. The botanical features of this species make it a unique example of parasitic plant adaptation in the plant kingdom."
