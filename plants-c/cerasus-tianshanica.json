It is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or yellow when mature, containing a single seed. It thrives in temperate climates and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and potential for cultivation, it is of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
