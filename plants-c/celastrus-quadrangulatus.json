    "intro": "Celastrus quadrangulatus, commonly known as the four-angle staff-vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems with four angular ridges, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries containing several seeds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin. Celastrus quadrangulatus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
