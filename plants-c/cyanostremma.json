    "intro": "Cyanostremma, commonly known as the blue-stemmed fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. These plants are characterized by their slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered leaves. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. Cyanostremma species often have vibrant blue or purple flower spikes that bloom in the summer. Their botanical features make them an important part of the ecological balance in their native habitats."
