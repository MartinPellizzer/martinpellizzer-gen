    "intro": "Chrysopsis berlandieri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow, dandelion-like composite flowers. Its fibrous root system allows it to survive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Chrysopsis berlandieri plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
