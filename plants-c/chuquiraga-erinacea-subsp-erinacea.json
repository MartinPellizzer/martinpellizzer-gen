    "intro": "Chuquiraga erinacea subsp. erinacea, commonly known as the Andean burr bush, is a shrub native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny growth and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, hooked fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fibers."
