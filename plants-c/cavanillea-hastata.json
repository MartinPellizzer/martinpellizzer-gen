    "intro": "Cavanillea hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cavanillea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Cavanillea hastata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
