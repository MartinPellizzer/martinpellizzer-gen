    "intro": "Cytinus hypocistis subsp. canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Island snailwort, is a unique parasitic plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, rounded stem that resembles a snail's shell. The plant lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to the roots of host plants, drawing nutrients through a haustorium. Its flowers are small and typically pale pink or white, and it blooms during the spring and summer months. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its specialized parasitic lifestyle and limited geographic distribution."
