    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis var. minor, commonly known as lesser water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive white or pale green coloration. Its flowers are tiny, white, and clustered in a raceme, usually appearing in late spring to early summer. This variety is closely related to other members of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate appearance and aquatic habitat preferences."
