It is characterized by its branching, fan-like structure composed of soft, fleshy polyps surrounded by a calcareous skeleton. The plant thrives in shallow tropical waters, often found in coral reefs where it can filter feed on plankton. Its unique appearance and habitat make it an important component of reef ecosystems. Ctenopterella pediculata plays a role in providing habitat for various marine organisms and contributes to the biodiversity of its environment."
