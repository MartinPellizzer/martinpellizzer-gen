    "intro": "Croton maritimus, commonly known as sea croton, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to saline and arid environments, making it highly tolerant of coastal conditions. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Croton maritimus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky shores or dunes."
