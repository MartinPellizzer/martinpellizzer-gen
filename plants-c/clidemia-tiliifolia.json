    "intro": "Clidemia tiliifolia, commonly known as Hawaiian tiliifolia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly Hawaii. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white or pink, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Clidemia tiliifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and is an important component of the native flora in its region."
