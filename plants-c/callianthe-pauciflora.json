    "intro": "Callianthe pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has slender, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful cultivation due to its specific environmental needs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
