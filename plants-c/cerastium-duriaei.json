It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh mountain environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
