    "intro": "Cotoneaster alatavicus, commonly known as the Turkestan cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
