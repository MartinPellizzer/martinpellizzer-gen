    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 peruzzisnum, commonly known as the Peruzzis' lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in cool, moist forest habitats and prefers partial shade. Its flowers are usually pink or white with a yellow or green throat, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
