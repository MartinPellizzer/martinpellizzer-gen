    "intro": "Cyrtopodium caiapoense, commonly known as the Caiapo Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a yellowish lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
