It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The leaves are typically lobed and vary in shape, giving rise to its varietal name \"heterophylla,\" which means \"different leaves.\" It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and naturalized areas."
