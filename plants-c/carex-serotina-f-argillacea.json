It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, cylindrical leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, clay-rich soils and is often found in riparian zones and along the edges of ponds. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
