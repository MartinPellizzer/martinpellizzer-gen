    "intro": "Carex praegracilis var. simulata, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and wet meadows. Its inflorescence consists of a spicate cluster of small, three-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is distinguished by its slender stature and subtle variations in leaf and flower morphology compared to the typical form of Carex praegracilis."
