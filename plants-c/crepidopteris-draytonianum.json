    "intro": "Crepidopteris draytonianum, commonly known as the dragon's blood fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green with a velvety texture and are adorned with small, spore-producing sporangia on the underside. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
