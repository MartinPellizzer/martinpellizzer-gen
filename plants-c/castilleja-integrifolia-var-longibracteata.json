    "intro": "Castilleja integrifolia var. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract castilleja, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to parasitize the roots of neighboring plants, drawing water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy structures. This variety is distinguished by its elongated bracts, which give it its specific epithet \"longibracteata.\""
