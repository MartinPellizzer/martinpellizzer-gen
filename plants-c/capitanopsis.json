    "intro": "Capitanopsis, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their dense, compact growth habit. They are native to South America, particularly in the Andes region, where they thrive in high-altitude environments. Capitanopsis species often have small, leathery leaves and produce clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to grow in poor, acidic soils."
