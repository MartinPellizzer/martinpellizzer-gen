    "intro": "Caralluma melanantha, commonly known as the black nightshade or black-tailed candelabra, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically dark purple to black when mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. Caralluma melanantha is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with succulent leaves that store water. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
