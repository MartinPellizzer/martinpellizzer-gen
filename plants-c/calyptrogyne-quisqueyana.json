    "intro": "Calyptrogyne quisqueyana, commonly known as the Florida salt marsh morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant typically grows in brackish or saline wetlands, often in marshes and tidal flats, and has adapted to withstand periodic flooding. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Calyptrogyne quisqueyana plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
