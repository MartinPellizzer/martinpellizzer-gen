    "intro": "Celtis iguanaea, commonly known as the iguana cherry or Mexican hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the Americas. It belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, round fruits that turn from green to red or black as they mature. Celtis iguanaea is often found in dry to mesic forests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
