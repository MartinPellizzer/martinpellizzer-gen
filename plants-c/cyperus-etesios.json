    "intro": "Cyperus etesios, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae, though it is often classified under the sedge family Cyperaceae. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its slender, grass-like leaves are usually arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Cyperus etesios is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
