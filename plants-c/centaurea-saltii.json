    "intro": "Centaurea saltii, commonly known as the saltbush centaurea, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and striking blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Centaurea saltii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
