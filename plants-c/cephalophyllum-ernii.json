    "intro": "Cephalophyllum ernii, commonly known as the Etna star-of-Bethlehem, is a rare and striking plant native to the volcanic soils of Mount Etna in Sicily. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with silver-green foliage. It thrives in well-drained, rocky substrates and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
