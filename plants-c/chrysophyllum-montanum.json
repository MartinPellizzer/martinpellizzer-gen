    "intro": "Chrysophyllum montanum, commonly known as the mountain satinash, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces small, round fruits with a hard shell enclosing a single seed, which is often used in traditional medicine. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates, and it also plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
