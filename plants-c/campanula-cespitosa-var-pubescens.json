    "intro": "Campanula cespitosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically hairy, giving the plant its varietal name, and are arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
