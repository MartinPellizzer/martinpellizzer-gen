    "intro": "Callichroa nutans, commonly known as the drooping flame vine, is a striking tropical climbing plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vivid orange to red tubular flowers that hang in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often mistaken for those of other ornamental vines. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its rapid growth habit makes it ideal for covering trellises or arches in gardens."
