    "intro": "Castanea vesca var. praecox, commonly known as the early chestnut. This variant is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It produces small, edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks, which mature earlier than the common chestnut. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible nuts."
