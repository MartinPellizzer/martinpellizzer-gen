    "intro": "Cissus sulcata, commonly known as the rock fig or zigzag plant, is a climbing vine native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, waxy, and often hairy leaves that have a distinctive zigzag pattern along the veins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically consumed by birds and small mammals. Cissus sulcata thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
