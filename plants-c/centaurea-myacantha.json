    "intro": "Centaurea myacantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf cudweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Centaurea myacantha is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor nutrient conditions."
