    "intro": "Cassinia cuprea, commonly known as the copper cassinia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flower heads that are often mistaken for single flowers. Cassinia cuprea typically grows in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature."
