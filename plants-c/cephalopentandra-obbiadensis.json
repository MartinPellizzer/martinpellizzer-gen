    "intro": "Cephalopentandra obbiadensis, commonly known as the Obbiad's flamewood, is a rare tropical tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, flame-like foliage and distinctive, spiral-shaped leaves that give it a unique visual appearance. The plant belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae, which includes many valuable hardwood species. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators such as bees and wasps. Due to habitat loss, Cephalopentandra obbiadensis is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
