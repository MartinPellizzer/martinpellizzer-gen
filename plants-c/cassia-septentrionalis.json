    "intro": "Cassia septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically odd-pinnate with 7 to 11 leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in racemes, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and are dispersed by wind. Cassia septentrionalis is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dye."
