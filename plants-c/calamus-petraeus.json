    "intro": "Calamus petraeus, commonly known as the rock calamus, is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae). It is a perennial plant characterized by its long, slender rhizomes and narrow, sword-shaped leaves. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous regions and forest understories. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural and ecological studies."
