    "intro": "Corylopsis sinensis var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved flame twisted vine, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical variety. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, candle-like flowers in early spring, which are highly fragrant and attract pollinators. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
