    "intro": "Cupressus goveniana subsp. gibsonensis, commonly known as the Gibson's cedar, is a subspecies of the western juniper native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen conifer with a conical shape and scaly, dark-green foliage. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This subspecies is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
