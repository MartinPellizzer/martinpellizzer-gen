It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in sandy or saline soils. The plant has a woody stem with small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in summer. Calligonum gypsaceum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
