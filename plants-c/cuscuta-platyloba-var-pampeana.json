    "intro": "Cuscuta platyloba var. pampeana, commonly known as the South American dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with slender, thread-like stems that attach to host plants. The plant is native to South America and is often found parasitizing grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing haustoria to extract water and nutrients from the host. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
