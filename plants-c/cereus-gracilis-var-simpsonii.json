    "intro": "Cereus gracilis var. simpsonii, commonly known as Simpson's slender cereus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, branching plant with cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, a characteristic common among many cacti in the night-blooming cereus group. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in desert gardens."
