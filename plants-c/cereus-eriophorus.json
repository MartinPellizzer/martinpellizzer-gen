    "intro": "Cereus eriophorus, commonly known as the Christmas star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, thick stems and clusters of bright, star-shaped flowers that bloom during the holiday season. The plant has a branching structure with spines that are often reduced or absent, giving it a more ornamental appearance. Its leaves are usually small and deciduous, falling off as the plant matures. Cereus eriophorus thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
