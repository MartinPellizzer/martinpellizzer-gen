It consists of several species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically green or purple in color. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Czerniaevia species are generally perennial and have a long flowering period, making them of interest to botanists and gardeners alike."
