    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. pilifera, commonly known as the hairy hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in autumn, providing food for birds and other wildlife. This variety is distinguished by its dense covering of fine hairs on the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and other disturbed soils."
