    "intro": "Convallaria montana, commonly known as lily of the valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its cluster of bell-shaped, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, dark green, evergreen leaves that remain throughout the year. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in woodland habitats. The flowers are typically pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies."
