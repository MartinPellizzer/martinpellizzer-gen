    "intro": "Cephalorrhynchus, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, helmet-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored and intricately structured. They are native to various regions in South America, particularly in the Andes, where they thrive in high-altitude environments. Cephalorrhynchus species typically have pseudobulbs and are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on trees or rocks. Their botanical significance lies in their specialized adaptations to harsh mountainous climates and their role in local ecosystems."
