    "intro": "Cineraria viscosa, commonly known as the sticky cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its woolly, silver-green foliage that is covered in a fine layer of white trichomes, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its textured leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
