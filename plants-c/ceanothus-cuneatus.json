    "intro": "Ceanothus cuneatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely cut, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a powdery blue-gray bloom. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Ceanothus cuneatus plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native gardens."
