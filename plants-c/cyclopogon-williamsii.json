It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant produces a cluster of small, green, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments.
