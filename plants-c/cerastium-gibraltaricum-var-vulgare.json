    "intro": "Cerastium gibraltaricum var. vulgare, commonly known as the Gibraltar mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and forms a mat-like growth habit, making it well-suited to rocky and coastal environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in limestone areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range."
