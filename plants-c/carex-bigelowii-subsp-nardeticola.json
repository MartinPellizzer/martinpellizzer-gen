    "intro": "Carex bigelowii subsp. nardeticola, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
