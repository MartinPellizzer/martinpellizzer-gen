    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 leeanum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is adapted for pollination by specific insects. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments such as mountain forests and meadows, where it thrives in partial shade. Its flowers are usually pink or white with a greenish hue, and it produces a single, showy bloom per stem. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
