    "intro": "Couepia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf couepia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
