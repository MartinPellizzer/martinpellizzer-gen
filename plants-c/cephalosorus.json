    "intro": "Cephalosorus, commonly known as the crown fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, clustered fronds that resemble a crown, giving them their common name. Cephalosorus species typically grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. They have a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, horizontal underground stems that produce new shoots. The fronds are usually leathery and have a serrated or toothed margin, contributing to their ornamental appeal."
