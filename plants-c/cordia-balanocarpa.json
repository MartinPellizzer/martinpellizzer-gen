    "intro": "Cordia balanocarpa, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and clusters of white, waxy flowers that resemble snowballs, blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, round, greenish fruits that turn red when mature, containing seeds enclosed in a fleshy pulp. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional medicinal uses in local communities."
