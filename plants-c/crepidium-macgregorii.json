    "intro": "Crepidium macgregorii, commonly known as the MacGregor's orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a single, slender stem and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late winter or early spring. The plant has a unique root system that allows it to thrive in cool, moist environments with partial shade. Its flowers are usually pale green or white with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown streaks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
