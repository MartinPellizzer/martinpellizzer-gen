    "intro": "Cerris \u00d7 suberosa, commonly known as the hybrid chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is a natural hybrid between Cerris sylvatica and Cerris ovalis, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The tree produces large, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, while the fruit is a spiny, woody capsule containing several chestnut-like seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in European forestry."
