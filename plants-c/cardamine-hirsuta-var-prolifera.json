    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. prolifera, commonly known as the hairy watercress, is a variant of the broadleaf watercress. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features small, kidney-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. It produces white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. This variant is often found in shaded, wet habitats such as stream banks and woodland edges."
