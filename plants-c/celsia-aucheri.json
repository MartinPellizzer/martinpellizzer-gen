    "intro": "Celsia aucheri, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions. Celsia aucheri is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
