    "intro": "Crepis schimperi, commonly known as the Ethiopian mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the summer months, and it produces achenes as its fruit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
