It features a basal rosette of pinnately divided, toothed leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, erect stems. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. This variety is often found in stream banks, wet meadows, and other damp habitats."
