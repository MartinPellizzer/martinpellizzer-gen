    "intro": "Carex arenaria var. pseudoarenaria, commonly known as the sand sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear greenish to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered with a fine layer of silvery hairs. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
