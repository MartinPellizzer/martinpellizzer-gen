    "intro": "Cariniana domestica, commonly known as the Brazilian walnut or cariniana, is a large evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and produces large, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. The tree is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. It also plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
