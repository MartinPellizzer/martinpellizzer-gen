    "intro": "Cleidion panduratum, commonly known as the yellow-leafed sycamore, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often yellow or green in color. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its bark is thick and ridged, providing a rugged appearance. Cleidion panduratum is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its hard wood and ecological importance."
