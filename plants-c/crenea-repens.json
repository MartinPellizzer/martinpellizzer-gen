    "intro": "Crenea repens, commonly known as the running carnation, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Crenea repens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in garden settings for its ornamental value and ability to form dense mats."
