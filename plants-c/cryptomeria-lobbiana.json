    "intro": "Cryptomeria lobbiana, commonly known as the Lobb's cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It belongs to the cypress family (Cupressaceae) and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The tree produces small, scale-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in crossed pairs. Its cones are woody and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. Cryptomeria lobbiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
