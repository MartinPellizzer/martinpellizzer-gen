    "intro": "Chionanthus virginicus subsp. maritimus, commonly known as coastal chionanthus, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast, where it is adapted to salt spray and well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and the plant often forms dense thickets. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
