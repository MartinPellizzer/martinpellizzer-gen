    "intro": "Cyrtochilum macropus, commonly known as the large-lobed\u6753\u5170, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as under forest canopies, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Cyrtochilum macropus has lance-shaped leaves and produces flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip that aids in pollination by insects. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
