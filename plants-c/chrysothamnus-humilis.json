    "intro": "Chrysothamnus humilis, commonly known as the yellow rabbitbrush, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert and sagebrush habitats. The species is adapted to full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant in xeriscaping."
