    "intro": "Cheilanthes tenuissima, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows on stone or soil in dry environments. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. It produces spores in compact clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its ability to thrive in harsh conditions, it is often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
