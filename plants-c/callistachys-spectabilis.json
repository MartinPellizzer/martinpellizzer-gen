    "intro": "Callistachys spectabilis, commonly known as the showy honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its ornamental value comes from both its attractive foliage and showy blooms. The plant is often used in landscape design for its hardiness and ability to thrive in partial shade."
