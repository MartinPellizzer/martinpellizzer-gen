    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 costei, commonly known as the hybrid sedges, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and spike-like inflorescences. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Carex cespitosa and Carex lyngbyei, resulting in a plant with intermediate morphological traits. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and pond margins, where it thrives in full to partial shade. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Carex \u00d7 costei is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological value and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
