    "intro": "Cylindropuntia rosarica, commonly known as the Rosarica cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, branching stems covered in clusters of small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its adaptations include reduced leaves and extensive root systems to survive in arid environments. Cylindropuntia rosarica is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance."
