    "intro": "Carex flava var. vulgaris, commonly known as the yellow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist and wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright yellow to golden green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually brown or reddish in hue, which contain the flowers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist soil conditions. Carex flava var. vulgaris is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
