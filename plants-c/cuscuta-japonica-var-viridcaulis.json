    "intro": "Cuscuta japonica var. viridcaulis, commonly known as the green-stem dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is often found on various agricultural and wild plants, causing damage by draining resources. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years. This species is native to Asia and is considered an invasive weed in some regions."
