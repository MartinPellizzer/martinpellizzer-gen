It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. Cyperus pubisquama thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often found in disturbed soils. Its fibrous roots and dense growth habit make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
