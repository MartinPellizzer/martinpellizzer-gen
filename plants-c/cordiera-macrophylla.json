    "intro": "Cordiera macrophylla, commonly known as the giant cordiera, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. These flowers are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences and are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. Cordiera macrophylla is well adapted to coastal environments and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils."
