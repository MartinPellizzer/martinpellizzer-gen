It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of overlapping, spirally arranged fronds that give it a unique appearance. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting the growth of the trunk and fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
