It typically grows on bark, soil, or rock surfaces in temperate forest environments. The thallus is usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a finely wrinkled surface. It has a complex structure with a medulla composed of loosely aggregated hyphae and a cortex that is often differentiated. This lichen is known for its ability to tolerate varying environmental conditions, making it a common species in shaded, moist habitats."
