    "intro": "Chenopodium hircinum f. deminutum, commonly known as the dwarf lamb's quarters, is a compact, herbaceous annual plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed but also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
