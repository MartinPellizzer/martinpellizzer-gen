It is characterized by its narrow, bluish-green leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Calamagrostis contracta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
