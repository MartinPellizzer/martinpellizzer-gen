It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and distinctive black or dark brown rhizomes. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
