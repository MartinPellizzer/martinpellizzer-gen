    "intro": "Cereus tephracanthus, commonly known as the Tephracanthus cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming at night. Its spines are short and sparse, providing minimal protection against herbivores. The plant is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
