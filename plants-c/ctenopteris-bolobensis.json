    "intro": "Ctenopteris bolobensis, commonly known as the Bolobo water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble water lilies. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks and in swampy areas. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a feathery appearance that helps it thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Ctenopteris bolobensis plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
