    "intro": "Crotalaria regnellii, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its yellow, spurred flowers and palmately lobed leaves. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its seeds are encased in a hard, dry pod, and the plant often grows in disturbed soils and grasslands. It is also noted for its role in promoting seedling growth by releasing chemicals that inhibit nearby plant growth."
