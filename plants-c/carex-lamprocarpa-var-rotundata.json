    "intro": "Carex lamprocarpa var. rotundata, commonly known as the rounded sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces wind-pollinated flowers, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats. The variety rotundata is distinguished by its rounded, broader leaves compared to the typical form."
