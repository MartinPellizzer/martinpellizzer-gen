    "intro": "Cecropia dealbata, commonly known as the white-veined cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves with prominent white veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, three-angled fruits containing numerous seeds. Cecropia dealbata is often found in disturbed habitats and is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Its rapid growth and unique morphology make it an important species in ecological studies and reforestation efforts."
