    "intro": "Cornus capitata var. mollis, commonly known as the soft-headed cornel, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but generally not favored by humans. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, turning yellow in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
