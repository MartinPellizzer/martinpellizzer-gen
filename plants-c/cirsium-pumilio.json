    "intro": "Cirsium pumilio, commonly known as the alpine thistle, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often at high elevations. The plant features a rosette of silver-gray, fuzzy leaves and produces small, spiny flowers in shades of purple or pink. Its stems are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Cirsium pumilio is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra regions."
