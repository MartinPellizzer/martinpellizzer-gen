    "intro": "Corymbia eremaea subsp. eremaea, commonly known as the Desert bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that often appears flaky or peeling. The tree produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The wood is dense and hard, historically used by Indigenous Australians for tools and weapons."
