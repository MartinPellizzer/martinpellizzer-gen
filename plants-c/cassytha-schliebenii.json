It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its twining stems that wrap around host plants for support. The plant lacks true leaves but has modified stems that perform photosynthesis. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by small, fleshy fruits. Cassytha schliebenii is often found in moist, shaded environments and can be invasive in certain regions."
