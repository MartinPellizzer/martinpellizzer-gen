    "intro": "Codon, commonly known as the genetic code unit, is not a plant but a sequence of three nucleotides in DNA or RNA. It plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by specifying which amino acid should be added next. While not a botanical term, the concept of codons is fundamental to understanding how plants express their genetic information. In plants, codons are part of the mRNA molecules that guide the assembly of proteins essential for growth and development. The study of codons in plant genetics helps scientists improve crop yields and develop disease-resistant varieties."
