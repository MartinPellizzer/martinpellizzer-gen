    "intro": "Cressa humifusa, commonly known as the creeping cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features prostrate or ascending stems that are covered in small, rounded leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are arranged in clusters, often blooming in early spring. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant spreads vegetatively through rhizomes. Cressa humifusa is often found in moist, rocky soils along stream banks and in woodland areas."
