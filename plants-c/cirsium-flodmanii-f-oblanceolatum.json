    "intro": "Cirsium flodmanii f. oblanceolatum, commonly known as the Flodman's thistle, is a rare and distinctive plant species within the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its large, spiny leaves and showy purple to pink flower heads, which bloom in late summer. The plant is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in southern France and Italy, where it thrives in rocky or calcareous soils. Its foliage is typically broad and oblanceolate, giving it a unique appearance among thistle species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable plant in its native range."
