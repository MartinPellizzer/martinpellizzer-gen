    "intro": "Calchas autranii, commonly known as the Autran's grass, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the French Pyrenees. It is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, elongated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and requires careful conservation efforts."
