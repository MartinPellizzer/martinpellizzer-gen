It is characterized by its cylindrical, branching stems covered in small, spiny segments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptations to arid environments include reduced leaf surfaces and the ability to store water in its fleshy stems. This species plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife."
