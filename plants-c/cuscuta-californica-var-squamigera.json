    "intro": "Cuscuta californica var. squamigera, commonly known as the California dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive appearance with thin, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to California and thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread widely. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological systems by affecting the growth of its host plants."
