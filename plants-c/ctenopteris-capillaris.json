    "intro": "Ctenopteris capillaris, commonly known as the slender sea palm, is a species of marine fern found in tropical and subtropical coastal regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are adapted to thrive in brackish or saltwater environments. The plant's rhizomes grow horizontally along the substrate, anchoring it in sandy or muddy substrates. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the undersides of the fronds. Ctenopteris capillaris plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small marine organisms."
