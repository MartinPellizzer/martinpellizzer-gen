    "intro": "Cleistocactus candelilla subsp. piraymirensis, commonly known as the Piraymirensis torch cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of northern Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white spines, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom at the top of the stem, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well adapted to its harsh desert environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
