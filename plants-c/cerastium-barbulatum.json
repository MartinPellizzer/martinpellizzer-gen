    "intro": "Cerastium barbulatum, commonly known as the hairy chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name and help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread across various habitats."
