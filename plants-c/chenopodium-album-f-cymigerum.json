    "intro": "Chenopodium album f. cymigerum, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is a variant of the common lambsquarters. It is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields. The plant is characterized by its alternate, lobed leaves with serrated edges and small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its seeds are minute and can remain viable in the soil for several years, contributing to its invasive potential in certain regions. The species is also notable for its nutritional value and historical use in traditional medicine."
