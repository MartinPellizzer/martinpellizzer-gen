It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brown flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in freshwater habitats. Its dense growth helps stabilize soil and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
