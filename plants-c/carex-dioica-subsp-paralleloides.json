    "intro": "Carex dioica subsp. paralleloides, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are either male or female, reflecting its dioecious nature. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
