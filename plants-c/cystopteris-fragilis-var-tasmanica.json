    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. tasmanica, commonly known as the Tasmanian brittle bladder fern, is a variant of the brittle bladder fern native to Tasmania. It is a small, delicate fern with a distinctive frond structure characterized by its fragile, papery leaves. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with closely spaced, needle-like pinnae that give the plant a feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family."
