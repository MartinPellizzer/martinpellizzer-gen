    "intro": "Claoxylon sitibundum, commonly known as the mountain ebony, is a small evergreen tree native to the highlands of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
