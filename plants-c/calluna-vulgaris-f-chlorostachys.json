    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris f. chlorostachys, commonly known as the green-stem heather, is a botanical variant of the common heather. It is characterized by its distinctive greenish stems, which contrast with the typical reddish or purple hues of the species. This form exhibits a compact growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing shrubs. The leaves are narrow and dark green, while the flowers are small, bell-shaped, and typically pink or white. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments."
