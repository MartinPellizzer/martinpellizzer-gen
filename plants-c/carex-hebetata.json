    "intro": "Carex hebetata, commonly known as the smooth sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three stamens and a single pistil. Carex hebetata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
