    "intro": "Cucubalus sibiricus, commonly known as the Siberian cucumber, is a perennial plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like pumpkins and melons. The plant features trailing stems with heart-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that develop into elongated, spiny fruits. Its botanical characteristics are adapted to survive in harsh, temperate climates with short growing seasons. The fruit is typically harvested when it reaches a mature, dark green color, though it is less commonly cultivated than other cucurbit species."
