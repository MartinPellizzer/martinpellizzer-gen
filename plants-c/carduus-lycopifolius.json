    "intro": "Carduus lycopifolius, commonly known as the spiked sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has a rough, hairy stem and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lobed and have a distinct, bitter taste, which has historically been used in herbal medicine. The species is considered an invasive weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various environments."
