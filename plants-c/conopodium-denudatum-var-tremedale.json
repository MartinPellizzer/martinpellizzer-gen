    "intro": "Conopodium denudatum var. tremedale, commonly known as the Tremedale bladder-leaf, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of Scotland. It is characterized by its unique, bladder-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous or upland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
