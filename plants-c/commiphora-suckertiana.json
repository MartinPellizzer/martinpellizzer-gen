    "intro": "Commiphora suckertiana, commonly known as the African myrrh, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, resinous sap that has been used traditionally for medicinal and incense purposes. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in semi-arid to arid environments. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
