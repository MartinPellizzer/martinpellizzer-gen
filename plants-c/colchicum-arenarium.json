    "intro": "Colchicum arenarium, commonly known as the sand colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, slender stems. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and often withered by the time flowering occurs. Colchicum arenarium is part of the Colchicaceae family and contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
