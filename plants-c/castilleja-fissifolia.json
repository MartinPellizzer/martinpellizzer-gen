    "intro": "Castilleja fissifolia, commonly known as the fissured milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its red to orange-red bracts and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with other plants, drawing nutrients from host species. Castilleja fissifolia is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments."
