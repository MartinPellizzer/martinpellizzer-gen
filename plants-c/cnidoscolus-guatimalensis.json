    "intro": "Cnidoscolus guatimalensis, commonly known as the Mexican giant water spinach, is a tropical shrub native to Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive reddish or purple coloration. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by spiny, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or near streams. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
