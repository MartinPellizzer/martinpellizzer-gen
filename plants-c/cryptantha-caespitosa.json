    "intro": "Cryptantha caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Cryptantha caespitosa is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe."
