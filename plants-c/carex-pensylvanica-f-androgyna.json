    "intro": "Carex pensylvanica f. androgyna, commonly known as the Androgynous Pennsylvania sedge, is a variant of the Pennsylvania sedge characterized by its unique floral structure. It is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family, typically found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, a trait that distinguishes it from the typical form. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green hue. This subspecies is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
