    "intro": "Cirsium arvense var. incanum, commonly known as yellow cockle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, and its root system is extensive and fibrous. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Yellow cockle is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
