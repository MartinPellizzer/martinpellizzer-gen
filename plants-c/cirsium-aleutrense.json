    "intro": "Cirsium aleutrense, commonly known as the Aleutian thistle, is a perennial plant native to the coastal regions of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves with rough, serrated edges, and it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in coastal habitats where it withstands strong winds and salt spray. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas."
