    "intro": "Cephalanthera, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a genus of orchids native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. These plants are characterized by their showy, often white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered at the top of the stem. They possess a unique root system that includes mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for nutrient uptake. Cephalanthera species are generally herbaceous perennials that thrive in woodland habitats. Their flowers are pollinated primarily by flies and beetles, making them important for insect biodiversity."
