    "intro": "Calamagrostis macrophylla, commonly known as the giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its coarse, stiff leaves and tall, panicle-like flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. Calamagrostis macrophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for wildlife and stabilizing shoreline soils."
