    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum subsp. corsicana, commonly known as the Corsican dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region, including Corsica, and thrives in dry, sunny environments. It is often found parasitizing shrubs and herbs, and its seeds are dispersed by wind or animals. The subspecies is distinguished by its specific host preferences and geographic distribution."
