    "intro": "Collinsia multiflora, commonly known as the California popcorn flower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and lavender. The plant produces fluffy, seed-filled capsules that resemble popcorn, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Its delicate appearance and ecological importance make it a valued species in native plant gardens."
