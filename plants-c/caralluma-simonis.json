    "intro": "Caralluma simonis, commonly known as the desert apple or Indian date, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits resembling small apples. Its leaves are usually small and spiny, which helps reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Caralluma simonis is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
