It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal areas or on disturbed ground. It has a low-growing habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its charming appearance."
