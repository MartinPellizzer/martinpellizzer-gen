It is a vine-like plant that can grow up to several meters in length, with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with contrasting yellow or white markings. These flowers are typically borne in clusters and bloom during the warmer months. Columnea scandens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
