    "intro": "Calyptocarpus africanus, commonly known as the African star grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that bear small, narrow leaves arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots make it an important component of the local ecosystem, supporting soil stability and providing forage for wildlife. Calyptocarpus africanus is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils."
