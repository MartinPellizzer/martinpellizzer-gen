    "intro": "Choisya dumosa var. dumosa, commonly known as Mexican beautyberry, is a flowering shrub native to Mexico and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale blue flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a versatile plant for garden use."
