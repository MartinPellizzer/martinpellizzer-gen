    "intro": "Cephalanthera xiphophyllum, commonly known as the showy lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers are arranged in a loose, spiral-like inflorescence, with each bloom featuring three sepals and three petals, one of which is showy and spurred. This orchid is also notable for its mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake."
