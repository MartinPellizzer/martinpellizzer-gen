    "intro": "Calophyllum scriblitifolium, commonly known as the scribbled leaf calophyllum, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that often display a distinctive, irregular pattern of light and dark green, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are known for their thick, waxy texture and are often used in traditional medicine. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its potential economic uses."
