    "intro": "Calceolaria rhizomatosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf calceolaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive calyx-like petals that resemble small cups, which give it its genus name \"Calceolaria,\" meaning \"little shoe.\" The plant typically grows from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its flowers, which come in shades of yellow, orange, and red, bloom in late spring to early summer. Calceolaria rhizomatosa prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
