It is a low-growing perennial with silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, reducing water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance and drought tolerance. It is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
