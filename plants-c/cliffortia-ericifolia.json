    "intro": "Cliffortia ericifolia, commonly known as the coastal flax or ericaceous flax, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid, coastal habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to rocky landscapes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on coastal cliffs and slopes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
