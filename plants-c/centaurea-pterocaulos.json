    "intro": "Centaurea pterocaulos, commonly known as the winged centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its striking blue to purple flower heads and distinctive winged bracts. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and the flowers bloom from late spring to early summer. Centaurea pterocaulos is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
