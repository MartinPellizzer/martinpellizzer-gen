    "intro": "Commiphora hildebrantii var. gallaensis, commonly known as the Ethiopian myrrh or Galgal myrrh, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Ethiopian highlands. It is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap, which is exuded from the bark and leaves, giving it a distinctive fragrance. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters, where it thrives in well-drained soils and mild climates. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. The resin, known as galgal, has been traditionally used in incense and medicinal applications."
