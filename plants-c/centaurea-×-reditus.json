    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 reditus, commonly known as the hybrid cornflower, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Centaurea cyanus (blue cornflower) and Centaurea stoebe (garden cornflower). The plant typically features striking blue to purple flowers with ray florets and a central disk, often with a distinctive red or brown stripe on the bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, commonly found in gardens and disturbed habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for floral arrangements and garden cultivation."
