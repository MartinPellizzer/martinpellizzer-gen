    "intro": "Crassula campestris, commonly known as the stone plant or ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the warmer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Crassula campestris is also known for its ability to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion."
