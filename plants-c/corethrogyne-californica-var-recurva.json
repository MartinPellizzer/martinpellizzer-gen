    "intro": "Corethrogyne californica var. recurva, commonly known as the California corethrogyne, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the coastal regions of California. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and dry summers. Its slender, recurved leaves and small white flowers make it distinctive, though it is often overlooked due to its delicate appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
