    "intro": "Cladoraphis spinosa, commonly known as the spiny cladoraphis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky environments. It has rough, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss, an adaptation to its arid habitat. Cladoraphis spinosa is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
