    "intro": "Chamaesyce leucophylla, commonly known as silverleaf sandmat, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, densely packed hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are often mistaken for those of other plants due to their similar appearance, but they are typically broader and more rounded. Chamaesyce leucophylla thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments."
