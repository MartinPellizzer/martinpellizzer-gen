    "intro": "Castilleja blumeri, commonly known as the Blumer's Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid red, orange, or yellow flowers that resemble a paintbrush. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures, relying on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Castilleja blumeri plays a role in pollination and is often found in association with other native flora."
