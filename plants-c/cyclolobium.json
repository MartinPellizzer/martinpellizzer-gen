It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, showy flowers that often have a velvety texture. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. Cyclolobium species are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their attractive foliage and flowers. Some species are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them useful in ecological restoration projects."
