    "intro": "Crepidium georgeanum, commonly known as the George's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a spike of small, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent, hood-like sepals and petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
