    "intro": "Cypripedium dominianum, commonly known as the Dominican lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of the Dominican Republic. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
