    "intro": "Carex sylvatica, commonly known as the woodland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, erect leaves and a dense cluster of spike-like flowers. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has fibrous roots and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-lobed, three-angled berries. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland and forest ecosystems."
