    "intro": "Cinchona acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved quinine tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties, as it contains quinine, a compound historically used to treat malaria. Its leaves and bark are harvested for their alkaloid content, which has been significant in pharmaceutical applications. Cinchona acuminata typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters in its natural habitat."
