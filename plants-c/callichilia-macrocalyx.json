It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, featuring vibrant pink to purple petals. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth texture and a slight waxy coating.
