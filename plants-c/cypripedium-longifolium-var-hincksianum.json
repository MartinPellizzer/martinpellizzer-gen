    "intro": "Cypripedium longifolium var. hincksianum, commonly known as the Hinck's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Appalachian Mountains of the United States. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces a single leaf that is often divided into two lobes. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich, well-drained soils. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
