    "intro": "Corylus sativa, commonly known as the hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It produces small, spiky male catkins and female flowers that develop into edible nuts enclosed in a husk. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full to partial sunlight for optimal growth. Its nuts are rich in nutrients, including healthy fats, protein, and antioxidants. Corylus sativa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for both culinary and commercial purposes."
