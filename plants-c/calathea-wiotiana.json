    "intro": "Calathea wiotiana, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, patterned leaves that often change color with the time of day, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. The leaves typically display vibrant shades of green, silver, and pink, with intricate veining that adds to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. This plant is popular among indoor gardeners due to its aesthetic value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
