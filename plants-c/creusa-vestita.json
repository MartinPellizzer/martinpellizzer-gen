    "intro": "Creusa vestita, commonly known as the white creusa, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its showy, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as swamps and wetlands. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and it produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans but serve as food for certain wildlife. Creusa vestita is often found in wetland ecosystems and is considered an indicator species for these environments."
