    "intro": "Cyphostemma rupicola, commonly known as the rock fig or desert fig, is a shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are an important food source for various animals. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged droughts. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in dry climates."
