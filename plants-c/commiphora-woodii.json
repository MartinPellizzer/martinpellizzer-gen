    "intro": "Commiphora woodii, commonly known as the African frankincense tree, is a small, slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It produces a resinous sap that can be tapped from its bark, similar to frankincense from other Commiphora species. The plant has a compact, bushy form with dense, dark green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive, aromatic scent when crushed. The plant is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
