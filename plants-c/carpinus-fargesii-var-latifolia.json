    "intro": "Carpinus fargesii var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, which are monoecious, containing both male and female flowers. Its fruits are small, winged samaras that mature in the fall, facilitating wind dispersal. This species is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
