    "intro": "Cynometra cubensis subsp. cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in lowland tropical forests and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces woody capsules containing seeds. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native habitat."
