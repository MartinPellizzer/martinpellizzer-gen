    "intro": "Cistus verticiliflorus, commonly known as the woolly rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
