    "intro": "Corethrogyne obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate corethrogyne, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, branched stems that are covered in soft, grayish-green foliage. The leaves are broadly ovate, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in late summer, producing a delicate, clustered inflorescence. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
