    "intro": "Caladenia exigua, commonly known as the slender spider-orchid, is an orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, spider-like appearance with a single, slender flower that typically has a greenish-yellow or brownish hue. The plant grows from a tuberous root system and is often found in heathlands and open forests. It blooms during late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, fragrant flower. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
