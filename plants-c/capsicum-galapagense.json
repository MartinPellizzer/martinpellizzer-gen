    "intro": "Capsicum galapagense, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos pepper, is a unique species native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a member of the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, elongated fruits that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with simple, ovate leaves and hairy stems. It thrives in the volcanic soils and arid conditions of the islands, adapting to the harsh environment. Due to its restricted geographic distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
