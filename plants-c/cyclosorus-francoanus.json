    "intro": "Cyclosorus francoanus, commonly known as the Franco's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in tropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in shaded areas with soft, muddy substrates. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, which are small and clustered. Cyclosorus francoanus plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
