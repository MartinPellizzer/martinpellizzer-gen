    "intro": "Coryphantha retusa var. melleospina, commonly known as the Honey Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. The varietal name 'melleospina' refers to its sweet-smelling flowers and the sweet, sticky sap that exudes from its stems."
