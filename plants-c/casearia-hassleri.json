    "intro": "Casearia hassleri, commonly known as the Jamaican beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a small to medium-sized shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture with a slightly waxy surface. Casearia hassleri is valued for its ornamental berries and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
