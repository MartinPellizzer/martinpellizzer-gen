    "intro": "Cylichnanthus neglectus, commonly known as the Neglected Cylichnanthus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as cloud forests and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cylichnanthus neglectus is considered a rare and under-studied species in botanical research."
