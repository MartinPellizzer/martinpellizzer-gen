    "intro": "Cucurbita pepo var. clavata, commonly known as the scallop gourd, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family and is native to the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, scalloped-shaped fruits that range in color from pale green to yellowish-orange. The plant typically grows as a vine with hairy stems and lobed leaves. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The fruit is edible when mature, though it is often used ornamentally due to its unique appearance."
