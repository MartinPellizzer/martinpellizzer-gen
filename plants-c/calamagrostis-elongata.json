    "intro": "Calamagrostis elongata, commonly known as the tall bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often have a bluish-green hue. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes are slender and often appear in late summer to early fall. Calamagrostis elongata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
