It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are long and narrow, often reaching up to 1 meter in length, and are arranged in a fan-like pattern.
