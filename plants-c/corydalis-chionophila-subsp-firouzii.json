It features slender, hairy stems that produce clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its frost-resistant nature. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes. Its botanical characteristics make it a striking addition to rock gardens and alpine collections."
