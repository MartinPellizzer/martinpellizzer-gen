It is characterized by its spineless, flattened stems that form a dense, low-growing shrub. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a \"tuna,\" is a large, fleshy berry that ripens to a red or orange color. The plant is adapted to arid environments and plays an important role in desert ecosystems."
