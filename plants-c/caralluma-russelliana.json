    "intro": "Caralluma russelliana, commonly known as the Russell's devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its upright, spiny stems that resemble a backbone. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its thick, fleshy leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Caralluma russelliana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
