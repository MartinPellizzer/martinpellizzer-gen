    "intro": "Cynoglossum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved hound's-tongue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers with five petals. These flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance. Cynoglossum longifolium is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
