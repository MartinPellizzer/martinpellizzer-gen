    "intro": "Crepis coronopus, commonly known as mouse-ear hawkweed, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along riverbanks. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
