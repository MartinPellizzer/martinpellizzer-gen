    "intro": "Chaenactis alpina, commonly known as the alpine ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. Chaenactis alpina is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions typical of high-altitude regions."
