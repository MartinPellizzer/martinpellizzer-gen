    "intro": "Corniola triangularis, commonly known as the triangular water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three narrow, lance-shaped leaflets arranged in a triangular pattern. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its small, white flowers bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to the water's surface. Corniola triangularis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
