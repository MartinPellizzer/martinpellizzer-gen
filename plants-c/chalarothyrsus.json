    "intro": "Chalarothyrsus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its small, often clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with compound leaves and pods that contain seeds. Chalarothyrsus species are valued for their hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally for carving and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species are now considered threatened or endangered."
