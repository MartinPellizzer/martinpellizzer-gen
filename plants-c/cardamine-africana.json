    "intro": "Cardamine africana, commonly known as African watercress, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Africa, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a peppery aroma, and its small white or greenish flowers are borne in clusters. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
