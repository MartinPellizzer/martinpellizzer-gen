It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by distinctive, elongated fruits that turn from green to yellow as they mature. Its roots and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The botanical features of Cocculus acutus make it an interesting subject for ecological and pharmacological studies."
