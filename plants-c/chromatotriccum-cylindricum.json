The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks, wetlands, and rocky areas. Its thallus is usually green or reddish in color, depending on the light conditions and nutrient availability. Chromatotriccum cylindricum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
