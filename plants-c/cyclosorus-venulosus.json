    "intro": "Cyclosorus venulosus, commonly known as the veined water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to freshwater habitats in Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, where it forms dense, mat-like colonies. The plant has finely divided, creeping fronds that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive circular pattern on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic ecosystem stability."
