    "intro": "Cyphia basiloba, commonly known as the coastal cyphia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid coastal environment. Cyphia basiloba is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
