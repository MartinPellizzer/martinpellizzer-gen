    "intro": "Cardamine foliacea, commonly known as water shield, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in wetlands, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has distinctive kidney-shaped leaves that are floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its small white flowers appear in clusters and bloom in early spring. Cardamine foliacea plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
