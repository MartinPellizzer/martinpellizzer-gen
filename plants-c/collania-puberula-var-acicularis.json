    "intro": "Collania puberula var. acicularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved collania, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are densely covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
