    "intro": "Camissonia heterochroma subsp. monoensis, commonly known as the Mono Lake camissonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, white to pinkish flowers. The species is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment of the Mono Basin, thriving in rocky, well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
