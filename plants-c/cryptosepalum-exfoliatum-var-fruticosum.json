    "intro": "Cryptosepalum exfoliatum var. fruticosum, commonly known as the hairy cryptosepalum, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring hairy, often glandular leaves and a compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant's flowers are small and clustered, typically in inflorescences that are densely packed. Its leaves are often covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores or environmental stress. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
