    "intro": "Ctenopteris pachycaula, commonly known as the thick-stemmed sea holly, is a species of fern native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, upright rhizomes and large, leathery fronds that are often divided into serrated segments. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is typically found growing near the shoreline or in moist, shaded areas. Its fronds are dark green and can reach lengths of up to two meters, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens. Ctenopteris pachycaula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate salt spray, making it suitable for coastal landscapes."
