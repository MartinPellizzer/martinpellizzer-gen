    "intro": "Cotoneaster hebephyllus var. majusculus, commonly known as the dwarf cotoneaster, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features small, oval leaves that are dark green and glossy, with a dense, rounded growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, followed by red berries that persist into winter. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture in temperate climates."
