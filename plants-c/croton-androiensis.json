    "intro": "Croton androiensis, commonly known as the Androensis croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its unique sap and diverse leaf structures. The plant typically features alternate, palmate leaves that vary in shape and size. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for its foliage rather than its flowers."
