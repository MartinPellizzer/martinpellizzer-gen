    "intro": "Callitriche verna var. repens, commonly known as creeping spring pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often covered in small, opposite leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters at the base of the stems. This variety is characterized by its creeping growth habit, which allows it to spread along the bottom of water bodies."
