    "intro": "Calamagrostis teretifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers in late summer, which are often tinged with purple or pink hues. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective plant for erosion control and habitat creation for wildlife."
