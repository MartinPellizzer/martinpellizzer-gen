    "intro": "Cryptocoryne stonei, commonly known as the Singapore cryptocoryne, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slight midrib. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, nutrient-rich substrates. Cryptocoryne stonei is popular among aquarists for its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal. It plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing excess nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
