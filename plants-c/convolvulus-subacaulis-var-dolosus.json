    "intro": "Convolvulus subacaulis var. dolosus, commonly known as the deceptive morning glory, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in the early morning. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system for water absorption. Its common name reflects its ability to mimic other plants, potentially misleading herbivores or human identifiers."
