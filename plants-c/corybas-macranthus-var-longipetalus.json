    "intro": "Corybas macranthus var. longipetalus, commonly known as the long-petaled hooded orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to New Guinea. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like floral structure that encloses the reproductive organs, a feature typical of the Corybas genus. The plant produces large, showy flowers with prominent, often brightly colored petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is a sought-after species in horticultural collections."
