    "intro": "Cheilanthes rosei, commonly known as the roseless rock fern, is a terrestrial fern species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of thick, leathery, pale green to grayish leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes rosei plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitats and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in crevices."
