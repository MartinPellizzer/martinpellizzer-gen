    "intro": "Campuloclinium palustre, commonly known as marsh mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a creeping rhizome and produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has soft, fuzzy leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate in form. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Campuloclinium palustre is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
