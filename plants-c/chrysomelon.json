    "intro": "Chrysomelon, commonly known as the golden apple or yellow apple, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. The plants are characterized by their palmate leaves and showy, yellow or orange flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. The fruits are typically fleshy, berry-like structures that can be yellow or red when mature. Chrysomelon species are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value and have traditional uses in some cultures."
