It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the mustard family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its reproductive strategy involves cross-pollination, facilitated by insects attracted to its floral structure."
