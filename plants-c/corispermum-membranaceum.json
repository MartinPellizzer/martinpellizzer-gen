    "intro": "Corispermum membranaceum, commonly known as the paperflower, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, papery bracts that give it its common name, and it typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low water availability. Corispermum membranaceum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
