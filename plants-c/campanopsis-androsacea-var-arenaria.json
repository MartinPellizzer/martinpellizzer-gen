    "intro": "Campanopsis androsacea var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand campanula, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to sandy soils in the southeastern United States. It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is well adapted to dry, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators in native landscapes."
