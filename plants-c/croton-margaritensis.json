    "intro": "Croton margaritensis, commonly known as the pearl croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often variegated with yellow and green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
