    "intro": "Colubrina infesta, commonly known as the Florida colubrina, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually pink or white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy appearance, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Colubrina infesta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
