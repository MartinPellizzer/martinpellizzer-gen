    "intro": "Cuphea elliptica var. oligostemon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cuphea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and showy, red-orange bracts that surround its small, tubular flowers. The plant produces clusters of tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant color and compact growth habit."
