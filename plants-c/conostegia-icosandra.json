    "intro": "Conostegia icosandra, commonly known as the Brazilian sand pine, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal and sandy environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas."
