    "intro": "Cheiranthesimum cayeuxii, commonly known as the Cayeux's cheiranthes, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Central Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are predominantly white or pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
