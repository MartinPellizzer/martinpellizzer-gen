    "intro": "Carex frigida f. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, cylindrical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color, and it flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant with ecological and botanical significance."
