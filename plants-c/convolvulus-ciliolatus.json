It is a herbaceous annual that produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has hairy, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves with ciliate margins. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name."
