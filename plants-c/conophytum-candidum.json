    "intro": "Conophytum candidum, commonly known as the white-stemmed stone plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss. Conophytum candidum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
