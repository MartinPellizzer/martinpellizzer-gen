    "intro": "Carex heleonastes var. robustior, commonly known as the robust sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces cylindrical spikelets that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is typically found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions."
