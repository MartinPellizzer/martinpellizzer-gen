    "intro": "Crataegus rosiformis f. rigidula, commonly known as the rigid-fruited hawthorn, is a botanical variant of the hawthorn genus native to the eastern United States. This plant is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and its small, rose-like flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the fruit is a small, red berry that ripens in the fall. It is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife. Its hawthorn berries are edible but generally considered to have a tart flavor."
