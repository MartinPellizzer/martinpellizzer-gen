    "intro": "Chamaefilix adiantioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that resemble those of the genus Adiantum. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its rhizome is short and produces a dense cluster of leaves, which are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
