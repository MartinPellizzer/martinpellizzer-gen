    "intro": "Clidemia cornoides, commonly known as the velvetleaf or creeping ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. Its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, and typically have four to five petals, with a white or pale pink coloration. Clidemia cornoides is often found in disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and forest edges, and can spread aggressively through rhizomes."
