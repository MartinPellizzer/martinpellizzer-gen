    "intro": "Cereus platinospinus, commonly known as the silver-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and sparse, spiny foliage. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The silver-blue coloration of its stems is due to a dense covering of fine, white hairs."
