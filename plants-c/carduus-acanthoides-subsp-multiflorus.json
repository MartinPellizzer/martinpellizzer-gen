It features a robust, upright stem covered with spiny leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces dense clusters of purple to pink flowers during the summer months, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a rough, hairy texture, while its flowers are composed of many small florets. This subspecies is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
