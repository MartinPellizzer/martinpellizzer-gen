    "intro": "Carex raymondii, commonly known as Raymond's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Native to the western United States, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for various wildlife."
