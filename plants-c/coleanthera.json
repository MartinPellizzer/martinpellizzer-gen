    "intro": "Coleanthera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant belonging to the orchid family. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly shapes. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly valued in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
