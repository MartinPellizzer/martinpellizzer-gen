It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Cypella violacea thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant for gardens. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
