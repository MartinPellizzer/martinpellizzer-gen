    "intro": "Cortaderia, commonly known as pampas grass, is a genus of ornamental grasses native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, feathery plumes that can reach heights of up to 6 feet. The plants have long, narrow leaves and produce showy, silver-white inflorescences in the fall. Cortaderia species are often used in landscaping for their dramatic visual impact. They are relatively low maintenance but require well-drained soil and full sun."
