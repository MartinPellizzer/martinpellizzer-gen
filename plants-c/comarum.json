    "intro": "Comarum, commonly known as water dropwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are aquatic or semi-aquatic, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plants typically have slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels. Their leaves are usually narrow and sometimes have a distinctive, waxy coating. Comarum species are valued for their ornamental appeal and their role in aquatic ecosystems."
