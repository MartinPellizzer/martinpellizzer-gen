    "intro": "Cerastium banaticum var. adenotrichum, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations that help reduce water loss in its often damp habitat. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
