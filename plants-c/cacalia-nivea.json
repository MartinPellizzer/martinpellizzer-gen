    "intro": "Cacalia nivea, commonly known as the white ragwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its showy, yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. Cacalia nivea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also noted for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
