    "intro": "Chlorospatha stellasarreae, commonly known as the starry sunstar, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant has small, narrow leaves arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
