    "intro": "Cyphia rupestris, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows on rocky outcrops and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces striking, orchid-like flowers that are often pale blue or purple, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to store water and reduce transpiration. Cyphia rupestris is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in stabilizing rocky soils."
