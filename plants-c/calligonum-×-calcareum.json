    "intro": "Calligonum \u00d7 calcareum, commonly known as the alkali tamarisk, is a hybrid shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces pink to reddish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing coastal and desert soils. Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in dryland areas."
