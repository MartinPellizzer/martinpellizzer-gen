    "intro": "Chelyorchis ampliata, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific wetland habitats in eastern Europe and western Siberia. It is characterized by its broad, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in peat bogs or marshes. Its reproductive strategy involves mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which are essential for its survival. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Chelyorchis ampliata is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
