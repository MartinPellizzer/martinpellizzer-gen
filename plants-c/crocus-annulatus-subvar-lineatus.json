    "intro": "Crocus annulatus subvar. lineatus, commonly known as the lined crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive white or pale yellow center. The flowers typically bloom in late winter or early spring, making it one of the earliest blooming crocus species. The plant is characterized by its finely lined patterns on the petals, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats."
