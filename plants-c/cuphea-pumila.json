    "intro": "Cuphea pumila, commonly known as the dwarf flamebeard, is a low-growing shrub native to Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround small, tubular flowers, which are primarily pollinated by hummingbirds. The plant has opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Cuphea pumila is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators to the garden."
