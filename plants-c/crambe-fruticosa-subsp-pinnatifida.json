    "intro": "Crambe fruticosa subsp. pinnatifida, commonly known as the fringed crambe, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and compound leaves with finely divided, pinnatifid (fan-like) lobes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a distinctive silvery-gray appearance. The species is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland scrub habitats."
