    "intro": "Chthamalia cuyabensis, commonly known as the Cuyabensis sea lettuce, is a species of green algae found in coastal marine environments. It belongs to the family Ulvaceae and is characterized by its thin, flat thallus that often forms dense mats on rocky substrates. The plant exhibits a simple morphology with a single layer of cells, allowing it to thrive in intertidal zones. It plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms. Chthamalia cuyabensis is typically found in the southern Pacific, particularly around the coasts of South America."
