    "intro": "Clematis pseudoalpina, commonly known as the alpine clematis, is a perennial vine native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Clematis pseudoalpina thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
