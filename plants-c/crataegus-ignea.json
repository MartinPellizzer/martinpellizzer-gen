    "intro": "Crataegus ignea, commonly known as the firethorn, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its sharp, thorny branches and bright red berries that persist through winter. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features small, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are usually white or pink, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The berries are toxic to humans and animals, making the plant a potential hazard in gardens."
