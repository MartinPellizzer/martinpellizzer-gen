    "intro": "Castilleja nubigena, commonly known as the cloud's crown or the ghost flower, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its specialized roots to absorb nutrients from host plants. The plant produces showy, red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, often in association with coniferous forests. Its growth is closely tied to specific ecological conditions, making it a rare and ecologically significant species. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Castilleja nubigena is considered a threatened species in many regions."
