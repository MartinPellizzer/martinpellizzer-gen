    "intro": "Ceanothus lanuginosus, commonly known as the wooly ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, soft, woolly foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, blue to purple flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Ceanothus lanuginosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
