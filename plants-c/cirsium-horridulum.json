    "intro": "Cirsium horridulum, commonly known as the rough thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. The plant features a robust stem covered in prickly bracts, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a rough, hairy texture. Its flowers are purple to violet in color, forming dense clusters at the top of the plant. Cirsium horridulum is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
