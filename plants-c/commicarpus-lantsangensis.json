    "intro": "Commicarpus lantsangensis, commonly known as the Lantsang wild quinoa, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive bracts and often edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, simple leaves with a rough texture, and small, clustered flowers. Its seeds are encased in a hard, dry fruit known as a schizocarp, which splits into two parts upon maturity. This species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique adaptations to extreme environments."
