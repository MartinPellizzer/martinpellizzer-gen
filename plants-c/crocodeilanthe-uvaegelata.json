    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe uvaegelata, commonly known as the dragon's blood fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, dark reddish-brown spore cases that resemble dried blood, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with clustered fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its spores are released in a sticky, dark substance that adheres to the forest floor and animals, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
