It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Cheirolophus burchardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
