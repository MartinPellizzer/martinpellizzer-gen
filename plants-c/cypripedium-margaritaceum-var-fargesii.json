    "intro": "Cypripedium margaritaceum var. fargesii, commonly known as the Farges' lady's slipper, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy pink or white flowers with a pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments and has a short rhizome with few roots. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
