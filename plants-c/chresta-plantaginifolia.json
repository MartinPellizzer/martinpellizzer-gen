    "intro": "Chresta plantaginifolia, commonly known as the marsh woundwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist meadows in Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically arranged in spikes at the top of the stems. It is often found in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in environments with high humidity. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a habitat for various insects and its historical use in traditional medicine."
