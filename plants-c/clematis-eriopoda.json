It is characterized by its hairy, grayish stems and heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental climbers. Its rapid growth and ability to cover trellises or fences make it both versatile and visually appealing."
