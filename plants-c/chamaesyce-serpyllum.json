    "intro": "Chamaesyce serpyllum, commonly known as smallleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to North America. It typically thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open areas such as fields and rocky slopes. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring. It is a member of the mustard family (Brassicaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions. Chamaesyce serpyllum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and invertebrates."
