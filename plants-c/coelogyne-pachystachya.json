    "intro": "Coelogyne pachystachya, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces numerous, narrow, grass-like leaves and has a unique growth habit that allows it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions. Coelogyne pachystachya is also known for its ability to produce multiple flower spikes from a single pseudobulb."
