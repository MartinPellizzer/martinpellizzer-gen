    "intro": "Cousinia argentea, commonly known as silver cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tall, spindly stems with clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Cousinia argentea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
