    "intro": "Cotoneaster emarginatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, ovate leaves with a pointed tip, which give it its specific epithet \"emarginatus.\" The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and seasonal interest. Cotoneaster emmarginatus is relatively hardy and adaptable to a variety of soil types, making it a versatile choice for gardens and landscapes."
