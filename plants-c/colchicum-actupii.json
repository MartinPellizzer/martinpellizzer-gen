    "intro": "Colchicum actupii, commonly known as the Alpine Colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. Its bulbs, which are toxic, are used in traditional medicine and are also a key part of its ecological role in its native environment. Colchicum actupii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes."
