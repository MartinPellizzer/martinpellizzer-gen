    "intro": "Conyza notobellidiastrum, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is an annual herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Conyza notobellidiastrum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
