    "intro": "Cardamine fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's water-crowfoot, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that form a rosette, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers in early spring. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic insect populations."
