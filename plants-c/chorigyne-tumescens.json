    "intro": "Chorigyne tumescens, commonly known as the swollen bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small organisms. These bladders are specialized for capturing prey, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor water environments. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, which includes other carnivorous plants. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to both aquatic and carnivorous lifestyles."
