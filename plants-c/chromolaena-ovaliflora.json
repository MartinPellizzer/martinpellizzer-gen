    "intro": "Chromolaena ovaliflora, commonly known as the horseweed or chromolaena, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it an invasive species in many parts of the world. It produces small yellow flowers that are followed by fluffy, white seed heads, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its aggressive growth, it can outcompete native vegetation and is often considered a weed in agricultural and ecological contexts."
