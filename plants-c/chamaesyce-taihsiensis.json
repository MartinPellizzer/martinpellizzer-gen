    "intro": "Chamaesyce taihsiensis, commonly known as the Taiwan sandmat, is a flowering plant native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, with five petals, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
