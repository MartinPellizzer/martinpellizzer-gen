    "intro": "Chamaecrista didyma, commonly known as the yellow sensitive plant, is a leguminous shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and showy yellow flowers that resemble those of the cowpea. The plant is notable for its rapid leaf closure in response to touch, a trait that gives it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, often growing in disturbed habitats. Chamaecrista didyma is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in nitrogen fixation in agricultural settings."
