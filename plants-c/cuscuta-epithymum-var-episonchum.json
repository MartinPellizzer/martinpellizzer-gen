    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum var. episonchum, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to various regions of the Americas and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or mechanical means, contributing to its widespread distribution. Due to its parasitic nature, it can sometimes cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
