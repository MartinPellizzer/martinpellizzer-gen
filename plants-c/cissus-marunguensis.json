    "intro": "Cissus marunguensis, commonly known as the African stonecrop, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its trailing stems and distinctive, heart-shaped leaves. The leaves are often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. This plant is adapted to rocky and dry environments, making it a resilient species in its native range."
