    "intro": "Ceratostema salapa, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features upright, branched stems covered in dense, woolly hairs that help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to violet in color, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often with a slightly hairy surface. Ceratostema salapa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
