    "intro": "Cacalia lappoides, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, which helps reduce water loss.
