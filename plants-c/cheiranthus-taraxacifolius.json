It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as walls and roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and resemble those of the dandelion, giving it its common name. The flowers are bright yellow and bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
