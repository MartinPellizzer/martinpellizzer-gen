    "intro": "Cyperus cephalotes, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in a distinctive umbrella-like shape at the tips of the stems. Cyperus cephalotes thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
