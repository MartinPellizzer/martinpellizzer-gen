    "intro": "Cheirostylis tabiyahanensis, commonly known as the Philippine violet orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring humid and cool environments. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
