    "intro": "Centaurea gayana, commonly known as the Narrowleaf Bladder Campion, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale blue to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Centaurea gayana is relatively easy to grow and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
