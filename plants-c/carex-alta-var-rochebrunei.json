    "intro": "Carex alta var. rochebrunei, commonly known as the high sedge, is a variant of the Carex alta species native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous environments. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish itself in its natural habitat. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
