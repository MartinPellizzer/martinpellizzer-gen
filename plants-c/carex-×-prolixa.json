    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 prolixa, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, cylindrical flower clusters. Native to wetlands and marshy areas, it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled berries. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
