    "intro": "Cordylanthus ramosus, commonly known as the slender broom, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume pods and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has slender, branching stems. Its small, white to purple flowers bloom in late spring, and it produces small, hairy pods that contain seeds. Cordylanthus ramosus is often found in chaparral and sagebrush communities, contributing to the ecological diversity of these regions."
