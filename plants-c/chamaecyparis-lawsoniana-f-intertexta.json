    "intro": "Chamaecyparis lawsoniana f. intertexta, commonly known as the Lawson cypress dwarf form, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen conifer with a distinctive pyramidal shape. It features scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and silvery-white underneath, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a specimen plant. This form is more cold-hardy than the standard Lawson cypress, making it suitable for a wider range of climates."
