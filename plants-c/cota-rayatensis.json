    "intro": "Cota rayatensis, commonly known as the Rayatensis cota, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
