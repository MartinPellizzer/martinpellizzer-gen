    "intro": "Cordia iguaguana, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in coastal mangrove ecosystems. The plant is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains several seeds, aiding in its dispersal by water and animals. Cordia iguaguana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
