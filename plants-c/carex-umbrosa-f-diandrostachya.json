    "intro": "Carex umbrosa f. diandrostachya, commonly known as the dark-haired sedge, is a variant of the broad-leaved sedge native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green with a bluish tint. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are usually pale green to brown in color. It thrives in wet or damp soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. This sedgeland plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
