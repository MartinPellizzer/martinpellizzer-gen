    "intro": "Carex foenea var. aenea, commonly known as the copper sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces distinctive, metallic-brown bracts that give it its common name. The copper sedge is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
