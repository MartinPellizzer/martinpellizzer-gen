    "intro": "Carex gigantea var. lupulina, commonly known as the giant sedge, is a tall, clump-forming perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and can grow up to several feet in height. The plant produces dense, cylindrical spikes of small, usually brownish or reddish flowers in the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its robust growth makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and wetland restoration projects."
