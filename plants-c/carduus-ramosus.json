    "intro": "Carduus ramosus, commonly known as the hairy thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields."
