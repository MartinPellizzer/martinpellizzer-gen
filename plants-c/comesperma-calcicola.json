It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, adding ornamental value to its habitat. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in dry, rocky areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
