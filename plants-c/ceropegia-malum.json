    "intro": "Ceropegia malum, commonly known as the velvet leaf ceropegia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, velvety leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in sandy soils. Ceropegia malum is a perennial shrub that is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
