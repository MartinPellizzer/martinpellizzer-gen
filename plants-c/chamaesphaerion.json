    "intro": "Chamaesphaerion, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. The plants typically have small, hairy leaves and produce yellow or orange composite flowers that bloom in spring. Chamaesphaerion species are adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments. They are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
