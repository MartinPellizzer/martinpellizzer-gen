    "intro": "Cheilanthes tenuifolia subsp. wrightii, commonly known as Wright's slender rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, including limestone and granite, and is well adapted to low moisture conditions. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the Polypodiaceae family. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging landscapes."
