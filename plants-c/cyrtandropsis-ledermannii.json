    "intro": "Cyrtandropsis ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the male cones appearing at the base of the plant and the female cones emerging higher up. Native to the humid lowland forests of Madagascar, it thrives in warm, moist environments with high humidity. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in its native range."
