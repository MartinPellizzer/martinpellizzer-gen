    "intro": "Carex leporina var. malvernensis, commonly known as the Malvern sedge, is a perennial plant native to the UK, particularly found in moist, calcareous grasslands. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical spikelets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, pale green leaves that form a compact rosette. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, followed by dark brown, spike-like fruits. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
