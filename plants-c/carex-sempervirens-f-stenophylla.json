    "intro": "Carex sempervirens f. stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
