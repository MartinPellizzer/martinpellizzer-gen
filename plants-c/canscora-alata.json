    "intro": "Canscora alata, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a slight sheen. The small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish or white, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
