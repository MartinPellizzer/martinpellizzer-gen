    "intro": "Cyclas, commonly known as the cycad, is a primitive plant that belongs to the order Cycadales. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. Cyclas are gymnosperms, meaning they produce seeds but do not flower, and they have a long evolutionary history dating back to the Mesozoic era. These plants are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Their unique appearance and ancient lineage make them both ecologically and botanically significant."
