    "intro": "Caladenia longicauda, commonly known as the long-tailed spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and distinctive, spider-like appearance of its flowers. The plant produces a single, elongated flower with a dark red or purple hue, often with a contrasting yellow or white lip. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is typically found in open habitats. Caladenia longicauda is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
