It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged drought conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in arid landscapes."
