    "intro": "Cocculus blumei, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, curved, seed pods that resemble a backbone, hence its common name. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit, contributing to its spread in natural habitats."
