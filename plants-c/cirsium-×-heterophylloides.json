    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 heterophylloides, commonly known as the heterophyllous thistle, is a hybrid plant species within the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being broad and others narrow, a trait known as heterophylly. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in regions of Europe and western Asia. It produces purple to pink flower heads composed of ray and disk florets, which attract various pollinators. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations that make it distinct from its parent species."
