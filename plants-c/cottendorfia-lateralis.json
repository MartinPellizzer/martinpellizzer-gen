    "intro": "Cottendorfia lateralis, commonly known as the slender cottendorfia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in areas with moderate to high humidity. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer, making it a sought-after species for botanists and horticulturists. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
