    "intro": "Crepidium sublobatum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in dense inflorescences with a distinctive greenish-white color. The orchid's botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role within its native habitat."
