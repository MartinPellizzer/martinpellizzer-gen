    "intro": "Christensonia vietnamica, commonly known as the Vietnamese cycad, is a rare cycad species native to Vietnam. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
