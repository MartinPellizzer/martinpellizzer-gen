    "intro": "Carex siderosticta, commonly known as the blue-green sedge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to yellowish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Carex siderosticta is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
