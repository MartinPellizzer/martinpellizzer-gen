    "intro": "Claytonia platyphylla, commonly known as the Sierra sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically features rosettes of fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white coating. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland areas. Claytonia platyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
