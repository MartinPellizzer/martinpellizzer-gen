    "intro": "Crucianella gilanica subsp. glauca, commonly known as the glaucous bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface. The subspecies is distinguished by its bluish-gray appearance, which is due to a waxy coating on its surfaces."
