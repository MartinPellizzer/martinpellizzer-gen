    "intro": "Coursetia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved coursetia, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of whitish hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle floral display to its otherwise sparse foliage. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a valuable plant for landscaping in desert environments."
