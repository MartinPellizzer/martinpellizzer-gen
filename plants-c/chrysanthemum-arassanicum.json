    "intro": "Chrysanthemum arassanicum, commonly known as the Armenian chrysanthemum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and produces daisy-like flowers with white to pale yellow petals. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, and its flowering period is often short-lived. It prefers well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to temperate climates with mild winters. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species within the chrysanthemum genus."
