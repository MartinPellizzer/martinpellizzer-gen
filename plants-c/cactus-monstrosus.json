    "intro": "Cactus monstrosus, commonly known as the giant saguaro, is a towering cactus native to the Sonoran Desert of Arizona. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stem and a distinctive branching pattern that develops over decades. The plant stores water in its fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers in spring, which attract pollinators like bats and birds. The saguaro is an iconic symbol of the desert and plays a vital role in the local ecosystem."
