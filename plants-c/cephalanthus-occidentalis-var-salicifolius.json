    "intro": "Cephalanthus occidentalis var. salicifolius, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and woodland edges. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a native, low-maintenance plant."
