    "intro": "Cestrum pedicellatum, commonly known as the night-blooming jasmine or star of Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, simple, and ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are predominantly white or pale yellow, which bloom at night and emit a strong, sweet fragrance. These flowers are followed by small, berry-like fruits that are edible but often contain toxic seeds. The plant is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and nocturnal floral display."
