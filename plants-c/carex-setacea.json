It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, grasses, and rushes. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, while its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike of small, three-parted flowers.
