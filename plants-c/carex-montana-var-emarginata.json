    "intro": "Carex montana var. emarginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and moist soil environments in North America. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly curved, with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often submerged or partially submerged in water. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
