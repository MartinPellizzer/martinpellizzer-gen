    "intro": "Cactus humifusus, commonly known as the flat-stemmed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit with thick, ribbed stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss and deter herbivores. Cactus humifusus is well adapted to harsh desert environments, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
