    "intro": "Cyclosorus taprobanicus, commonly known as the Ceylon water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant has four leaflets arranged in a cross shape, which is a distinctive feature of the genus Cyclosorus. It thrives in still or slow-moving water and is often found in marshy areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
