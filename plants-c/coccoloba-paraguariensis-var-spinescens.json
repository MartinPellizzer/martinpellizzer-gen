    "intro": "Coccoloba paraguariensis var. spinescens, commonly known as the spiny coccoloba, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into several leaflets with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Its spiny leaves and berries make it a distinctive and sometimes invasive species in its native habitat."
