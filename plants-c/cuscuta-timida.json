    "intro": "Cuscuta timida, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves attaching to a host through specialized haustoria. The plant is often found on crops like corn and soybeans, making it a significant agricultural pest. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and even through human activity. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or kill its host, impacting both wild and cultivated plant communities."
