    "intro": "Columnea purpurimarginata, commonly known as the purple-margin columnea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with purple margins. The plant produces opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its colorful blooms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing in the understory of forests. Columnea purpurimarginata is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
