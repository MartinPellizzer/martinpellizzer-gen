    "intro": "Critonia daleoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. Critonia daleoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in aquatic environments."
