    "intro": "Calathea humilis, commonly known as the dwarf calathea, is a tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Marantaceae family and is characterized by its striking, patterned leaves. The leaves are typically dark green with intricate veining that shifts color in response to light, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and indirect sunlight. Calathea humilis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
