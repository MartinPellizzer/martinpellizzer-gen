    "intro": "Cheilanthes botswanae, commonly known as the Botswana rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green fronds with a leathery texture, adapted to withstand drought conditions. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating reproduction in its harsh environment."
