    "intro": "Cenchrus distichophyllus, commonly known as the two-leaf porcupine grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its resilience and adaptability make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
