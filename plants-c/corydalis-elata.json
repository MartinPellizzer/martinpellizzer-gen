It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, bean-like seed pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.

Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking hardy, early-blooming plants."
