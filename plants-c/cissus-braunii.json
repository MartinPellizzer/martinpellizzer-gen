It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for vertical gardening and green walls."
