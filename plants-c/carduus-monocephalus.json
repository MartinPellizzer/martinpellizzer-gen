The plant has deeply lobed, silvery-green leaves with rough textures and a distinct, bitter taste. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wastelands, and along roadsides. Carduus monocephalus is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in traditional herbal remedies."
