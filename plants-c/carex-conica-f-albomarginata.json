    "intro": "Carex conica f. albomarginata, commonly known as the white-margin sedge, is a variant of the common sedge, Carex conica. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a distinct white or pale margin. This plant thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike that bears small, three-lobed flowers. The white-margin sedge is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
