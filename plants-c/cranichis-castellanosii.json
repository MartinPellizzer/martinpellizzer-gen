    "intro": "Cranichis castellanosii, commonly known as the Castellanos' orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, adapted to the high-altitude environments where it thrives. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
