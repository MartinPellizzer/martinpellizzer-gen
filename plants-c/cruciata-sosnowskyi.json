    "intro": "Cruciata sosnowskyi, commonly known as Sosnowsky's crucifix, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its distinctive cruciform (cross-shaped) flowers, which are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a compact growth habit and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small, showy flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
