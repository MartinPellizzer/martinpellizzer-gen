    "intro": "Ceratostylis caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered tongue orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth. The plant forms dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its roots are often rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form colonies. The orchid's unique floral structure and adaptability to humid conditions make it a distinctive species within the Orchidaceae family."
