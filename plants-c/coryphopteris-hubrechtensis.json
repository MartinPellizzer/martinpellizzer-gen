    "intro": "Coryphopteris hubrechtensis, commonly known as the Hubrecht's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form dense, carpet-like growths on shaded forest floors. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its small, spore-bearing structures are clustered in specialized leaf clusters called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
