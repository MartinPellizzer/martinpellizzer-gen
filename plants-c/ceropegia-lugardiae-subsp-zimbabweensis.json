    "intro": "Ceropegia lugardiae subsp. zimbabweensis, commonly known as the Zimbabwean milkweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, trailing stems and small, pale green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces unique, tubular flowers that are typically pale pink or white, attracting specific pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical collections."
