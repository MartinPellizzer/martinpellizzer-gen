    "intro": "Calystegia stans, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to temperate regions of Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and sprawling habit, often covering the ground or climbing supports. Its fruit is a capsule that releases seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. Botanically, it belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
