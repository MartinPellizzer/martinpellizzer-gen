    "intro": "Cedrelopsis rakotozafyi, commonly known as the Madagascar cedar, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the eastern rainforests of Madagascar. It is a member of the Cupressaceae family, which includes cypress and juniper trees. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and conical shape, with scale-like leaves arranged in flattened sprays. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of gymnosperms. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cedrelopsis rakotozafyi is considered critically endangered and is of significant botanical interest for its unique adaptations and ecological role."
