    "intro": "Cyrtochilum engelii, commonly known as the Engel's slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pouch-like flower structure known as a resupinate labellum. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to thrive. Cyrtochilum engelii produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species, often found in the understory of tropical forests."
