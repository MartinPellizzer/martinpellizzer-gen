    "intro": "Cardamine bellidifolia f. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered watercress, is a variant of the watercress species native to moist, temperate regions. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating in water. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers with four petals, which are arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. Botanically, it is valued for its rapid growth and ability to colonize aquatic habitats, making it an important species in ecological studies."
