    "intro": "Cardamine acris subsp. acris, commonly known as the slender water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are typically submerged or floating on the surface of freshwater habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five sepals and numerous stamens, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. Its delicate structure and aquatic adaptation make it an important indicator species for water quality in riparian zones."
