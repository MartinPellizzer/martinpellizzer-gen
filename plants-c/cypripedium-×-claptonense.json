    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 claptonense, commonly known as the Clapton's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of China and Vietnam. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without being exposed to direct sun. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor firmly in the soil while absorbing nutrients from the rich, organic substrates. Due to its ornamental value and rarity in the wild, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
