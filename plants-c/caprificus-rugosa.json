    "intro": "Caprificus rugosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, dark green, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by dark, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Caprificus rugosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
