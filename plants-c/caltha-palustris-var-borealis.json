    "intro": "Caltha palustris var. borealis, commonly known as the northern marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It thrives in wet, boggy environments and is characterized by its bright yellow, buttercup-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white down. It is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other moist habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
