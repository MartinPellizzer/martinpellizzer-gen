    "intro": "Chastenaea grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved chastenaea, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Chastenaea grandifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
