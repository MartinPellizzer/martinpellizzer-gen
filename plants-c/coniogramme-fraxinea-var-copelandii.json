    "intro": "Coniogramme fraxinea var. copelandii, commonly known as the Copeland's coniogramme, is a rare and ornamental plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage with finely divided, arching leaves that create a lush, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its botanical features include small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow in color, followed by the production of tiny, round berries. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
