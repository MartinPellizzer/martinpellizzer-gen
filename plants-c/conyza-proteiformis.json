    "intro": "Conyza proteiformis, commonly known as the variable weed or the variable conyza, is a flowering plant species native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. It produces small, white to yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Conyza proteiformis is known for its morphological variability, which can make it challenging to identify."
