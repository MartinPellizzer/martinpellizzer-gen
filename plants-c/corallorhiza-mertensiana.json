    "intro": "Corallorhiza mertensiana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for its nutrients, making it a myco-heterotroph. The plant has a slender, unbranched stem with a single, showy, pinkish-white flower that resembles a ghostly apparition. It thrives in shaded, moist hardwood forests and is often found growing through the leaves of other plants. Due to its specialized habitat and conservation status, it is considered endangered in many areas."
