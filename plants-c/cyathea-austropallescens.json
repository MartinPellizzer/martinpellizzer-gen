    "intro": "Cyathea austropallescens, commonly known as the Australian tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rainforests and along stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a unique feature that aids in attracting pollinators. Cyathea austropallescens plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
