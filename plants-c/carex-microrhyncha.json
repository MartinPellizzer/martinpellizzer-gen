    "intro": "Carex microrhyncha, commonly known as the small-beaked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences, typical of sedges. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually wind-pollinated, and the plant produces small, three-angled berries. Carex microrhyncha is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
