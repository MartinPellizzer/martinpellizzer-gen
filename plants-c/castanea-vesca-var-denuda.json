    "intro": "Castanea vesca var. denuda, commonly known as the naked horse chestnut. This variant is characterized by its lack of bracts, which are typically present in other species of the Castanea genus. It produces small, spiny fruits that contain a single nut, similar to other horse chestnut species. The leaves are palmately lobed and can reach up to 20 centimeters in length. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
