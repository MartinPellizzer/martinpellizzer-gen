    "intro": "Corallorhiza trifida, commonly known as the trifid beardtongue, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, coral-like appearance. It is a terrestrial herb that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in a loose spike. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodlands, often in regions with well-drained soil. Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
