    "intro": "Calothamnus borealis subsp. cinereus, commonly known as the silverleaf swamp everlasting, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the wetlands of southern Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to red in color, blooming during the cooler months. It is adapted to waterlogged soils and is often found in swampy or seasonally flooded habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
