    "intro": "Carex pensylvanica, commonly known as Pennsylvania sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Pennsylvania sedge is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
