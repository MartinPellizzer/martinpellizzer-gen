    "intro": "Chrysocoma candelabrum, commonly known as the candle bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, white flowers that resemble candle flames, hence its common name. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, reddish-brown fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Chrysocoma candelabrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
