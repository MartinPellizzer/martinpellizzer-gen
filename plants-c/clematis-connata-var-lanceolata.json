    "intro": "Clematis connata var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, typically lance-shaped, which give it its variety name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, usually in shades of white or pale blue. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for climbing structures or trellises. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking both beauty and hardiness."
