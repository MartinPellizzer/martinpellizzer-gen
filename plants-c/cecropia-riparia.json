    "intro": "Cecropia riparia, commonly known as the river cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, often greenish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, three-lobed fruits containing three seeds. Cecropia riparia is often found near water sources, thriving in moist, shaded environments. It plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
