    "intro": "Cyclosorus hastatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in eastern North America. It has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread across the substrate, forming dense mats. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in pairs along the stems. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are borne in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. Cyclosorus hastatus plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
