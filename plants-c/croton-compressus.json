    "intro": "Croton compressus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, often displaying a striking yellow-green coloration. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
