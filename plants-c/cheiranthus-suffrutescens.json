    "intro": "Cheiranthus suffrutescens, commonly known as the woolly wallflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and the Middle East. It features hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
