    "intro": "Cypripedium philippinense, commonly known as the Philippine lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like flower that resembles a slipper, typically in shades of pink or white. The plant has a tall, erect stem with broad, leathery leaves and produces a single, showy bloom. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments and is often found in montane regions. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it faces significant conservation challenges."
