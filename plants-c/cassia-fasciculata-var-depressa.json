    "intro": "Cassia fasciculata var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf sicklepod, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a low-growing shrub with slender, branching stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, twisted seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many parts of the world."
