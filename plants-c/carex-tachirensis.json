    "intro": "Carex tachirensis, commonly known as the Tachira sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to South America, particularly found in Venezuela and Colombia, where it grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant has grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams. Due to its preference for wet habitats, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
