It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its alternate leaf arrangement and small, blue-green flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed soils or open habitats. It has been introduced to other parts of the world and is sometimes considered an invasive species. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic."
