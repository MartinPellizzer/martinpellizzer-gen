    "intro": "Caladenia longicauda subsp. clivicola, commonly known as the cliff rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often on cliffs or slopes, where it receives adequate sunlight. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears one or two flowering stems, each with a single, narrow, pink or pale purple flower. Its flowers are characterized by a distinctive labellum that is often split into two lobes, giving it a unique appearance. This subspecies is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions."
