It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and slender, often hairy stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of xerophytic vegetation."
