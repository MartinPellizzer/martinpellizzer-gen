    "intro": "Cephalanthera longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, rhizomatous root system and lacks true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures. The plant produces a single, erect stem bearing a single, showy, greenish-white flower with a distinctive hooded lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. Cephalanthera longifolia is known for its mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake."
