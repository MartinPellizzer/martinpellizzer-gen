    "intro": "Centaurea diluvialis, commonly known as the floodplain star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright, spiny stems and bright blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun, making it common in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Centaurea diluvialis is often found in riverbanks, roadsides, and other areas prone to flooding."
