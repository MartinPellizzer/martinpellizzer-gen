    "intro": "Clypeola spinosa, commonly known as the spiny clypeola, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in temperate climates. Clypeola spinosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
