    "intro": "Colymbada ragusina, commonly known as the Ragusan water clover, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, resembling the leaves of water clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its small, white flowers bloom in early summer, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
