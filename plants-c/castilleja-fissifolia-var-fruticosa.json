    "intro": "Castilleja fissifolia var. fruticosa, commonly known as the fruticose castilleja, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a complex root system that allows it to attach to the roots of other plants, drawing nutrients from them. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its leaves are often reduced to small scales, and its stems are branching and shrub-like, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
