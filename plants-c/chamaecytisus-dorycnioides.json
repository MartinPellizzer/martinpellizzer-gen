    "intro": "Chamaecytisus dorycnioides, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, arching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine, silky hairs. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils."
