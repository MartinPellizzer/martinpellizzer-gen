    "intro": "Centhriscus fumarioides, commonly known as the flame flower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant is an herbaceous perennial, typically growing to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by hummingbirds and bats, which are attracted to its nectar-rich blooms. Centhriscus fumarioides thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical gardens."
