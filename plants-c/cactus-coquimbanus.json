    "intro": "Cactus coquimbanus, commonly known as the Coquimbo cactus, is a species native to Chile. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows in coastal areas with sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features a short, thick stem that stores water, and it produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry climates."
