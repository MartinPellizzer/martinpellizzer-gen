It is characterized by its large, showy leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length and its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant is native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States and thrives in moist, fertile soils. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking foliage and floral display. Canna \u00d7 generalis is a perennial that requires full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance once established."
