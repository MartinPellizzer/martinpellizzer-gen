    "intro": "Ceratozamia tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a slow-growing, evergreen plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves that are narrow and strap-like. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
