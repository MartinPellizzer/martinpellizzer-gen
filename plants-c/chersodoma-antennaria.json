    "intro": "Chersodoma antennaria, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique and rare plant species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to white flowers that resemble the appearance of a ghostly face, giving it its common name. The plant has a low-growing habit with a central stem that branches into fine, hair-like filaments, which support the small, showy blooms. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
