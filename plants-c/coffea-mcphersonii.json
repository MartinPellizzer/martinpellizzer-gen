    "intro": "Coffea mcphersonii, commonly known as the McPherson coffee. It is a rare and little-known species of coffee native to the highlands of Colombia. This plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, red berries containing seeds used for coffee production. It thrives in shaded, humid conditions with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and low yields, it is not widely cultivated or commercially available."
