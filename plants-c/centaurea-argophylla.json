    "intro": "Centaurea argophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, silvery-gray leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers clustered in dense, spherical heads, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. Centaurea argophylla is often used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
