    "intro": "Commiphora rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered myrrh tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the release of a fragrant, resinous sap. This sap, often referred to as myrrh, has been historically used in incense, medicine, and as a preservative. Commiphora rubriflora thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions."
