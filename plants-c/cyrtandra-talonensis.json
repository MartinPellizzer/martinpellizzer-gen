    "intro": "Cyrtandra talonensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant is often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Cyrtandra talonensis has small, heart-shaped leaves and produces distinctive, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
