    "intro": "Castilleja chrysantha, commonly known as the golden crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate and often appear in clusters along the stem. Castilleja chrysantha is typically found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
