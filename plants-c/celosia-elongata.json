    "intro": "Celosia elongata, commonly known as the flame flower or crown of thorns, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers at the base of the bracts, which are often overlooked. Celosia elongata is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
