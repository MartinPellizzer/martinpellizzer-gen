It is a clump-forming plant that grows in dense, evergreen tussocks, often in high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Chusquea foliosa is known for its ability to thrive in cool, moist conditions and is often used in ornamental horticulture. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various invertebrates and small mammals in its native range."
