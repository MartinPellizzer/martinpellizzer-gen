    "intro": "Campanula humillima, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves and a compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rock gardens or alpine settings. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Campanula humillima is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates."
