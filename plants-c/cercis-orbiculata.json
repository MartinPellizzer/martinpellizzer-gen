    "intro": "Cercis orbiculata, commonly known as the Persian or Persian lilac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its orbicular (round) leaves and showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and produces small, dark red to black berries in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Cercis orbiculata prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade."
