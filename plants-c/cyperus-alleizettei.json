    "intro": "Cyperus alleizettei, commonly known as the dwarf flatsedge, is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and pond edges. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Cyperus alleizettei is native to parts of Africa and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
