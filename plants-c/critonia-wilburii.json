    "intro": "Critonia wilburii, commonly known as the Wilbur's crithmum, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
