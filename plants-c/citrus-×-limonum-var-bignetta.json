    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 limonum var. bignetta, commonly known as the bignetta lemon, is a botanical variant of the lemon plant characterized by its small, round fruits with a thin, yellow peel. This variety is native to southern Europe and is often cultivated for its aromatic zest and juice, which are used in culinary and perfumery applications. The plant typically grows as a small shrub with glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The fruit's high acidity and distinct flavor make it a valuable ingredient in both food and fragrance industries."
