    "intro": "Cyclosorus superbus, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a complex rhizome system that allows it to spread rapidly in still or slow-moving water. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds. Cyclosorus superbus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms."
