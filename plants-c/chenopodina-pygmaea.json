    "intro": "Chenopodina pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf goosefoot, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent leaves and short, compact growth habit. The plant typically grows close to the ground, often in sandy or gravelly soils, and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its small size and drought tolerance make it a resilient species in ecological systems. The leaves are usually green, sometimes with a bluish or purplish tint, and may have a slightly hairy texture."
