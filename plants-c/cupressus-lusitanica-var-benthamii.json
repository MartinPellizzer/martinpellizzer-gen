    "intro": "Cupressus lusitanica var. benthamii, commonly known as the Portuguese cypress, is a rare and ornamental conifer native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
