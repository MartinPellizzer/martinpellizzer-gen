    "intro": "Cissus arthroclada, commonly known as the rock fig or stone cissus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Cissus arthroclada is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its adaptability and ornamental appeal."
