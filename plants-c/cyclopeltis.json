    "intro": "Cyclopeltis, commonly known as the button fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Pandanaceae. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its unique, button-like spore-bearing structures called sporangia. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a tendency to curl at the tips. Cyclopeltis species are native to various regions in Asia and are often cultivated for their ornamental value. These plants thrive in humid, shaded environments and are well-suited for indoor cultivation."
