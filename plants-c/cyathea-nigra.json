    "intro": "Cyathea nigra, commonly known as the black tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its massive fronds, which are used for photosynthesis. Cyathea nigra plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
