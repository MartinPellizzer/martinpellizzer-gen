    "intro": "Cousinia khorramabadensis var. purpurea, commonly known as the Persian flowering spurges, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western Iran. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant purple to pink flowers. The plant features basal rosettes of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat."
