    "intro": "Celsia commixta, commonly known as the hybrid celsia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cooler, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Celsia commixta is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
