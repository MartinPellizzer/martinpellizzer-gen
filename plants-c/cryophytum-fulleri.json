    "intro": "Cryophytum fulleri, commonly known as the Antarctic pearlwort, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of South America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming species that thrives in harsh, alpine environments. The plant features small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Cryophytum fulleri is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme climatic conditions."
