It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenia. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.
