    "intro": "Cupressus austrotibetica subsp. tongmaiensis, commonly known as the Tongmai cypress, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dense, dark green foliage. The plant exhibits a unique combination of morphological traits, including scale-like leaves and small, round cones. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
