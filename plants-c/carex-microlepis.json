    "intro": "Carex microlepis, commonly known as the small-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces small, three-lobed berries. Carex microlepis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
