    "intro": "Carex macloviana subsp. haydeniana, commonly known as Hayden's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in a loose panicle. Hayden's sedge is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
