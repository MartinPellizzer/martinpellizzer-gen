    "intro": "Carex herbariorum, commonly known as the herbarium sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown in color. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. Carex herbariorum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
