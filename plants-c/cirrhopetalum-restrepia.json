    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum restrepia, commonly known as the Restrepo's cirrhopetalum, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically display vibrant purple or pink hues. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface, and its growth habit is usually shrub-like with multiple stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
