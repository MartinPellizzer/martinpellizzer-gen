    "intro": "Campanula rapunculus var. micrantha, commonly known as the lesser bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in early summer. The leaves are lanceolate and slightly hairy, with a basal rosette structure that helps it retain moisture. This variety is often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it can be somewhat invasive in certain regions."
