    "intro": "Cicuta monnieri, commonly known as water hemlock, is a toxic herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters. The plant contains potent toxic compounds, primarily cicutoxin, which can be lethal to humans and animals. It typically grows in wet, disturbed soils along streambanks and marshes. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is often considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
