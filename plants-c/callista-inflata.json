    "intro": "Callista inflata, commonly known as the inflated callista, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is notable for its unique, inflated seed heads that resemble small, round balloons, which give it its common name. These seed heads are designed to catch the wind, aiding in the dispersal of its seeds. Callista inflata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
