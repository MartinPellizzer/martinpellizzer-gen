    "intro": "Carduus inermis, commonly known as the common cockleburs, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small cones. The plant features spiny, prickly bracts surrounding its flowers, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, winged seeds that are easily dispersed by wind. Carduus inermis is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain regions."
