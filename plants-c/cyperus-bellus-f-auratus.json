    "intro": "Cyperus bellus f. auratus, commonly known as the golden flatsedge, is a variant of the Cyperus bellus species. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The most distinctive feature of this plant is its bright golden-yellow inflorescence, which sets it apart from the typical green or brown flowers of other Cyperus species. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This ornamental plant is valued for its aesthetic appeal in water gardens and as a decorative element in humid landscapes."
