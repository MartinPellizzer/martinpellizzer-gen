    "intro": "Cadetia collina, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of western Europe. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Cadetia collina is often found in maritime habitats and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dune systems."
