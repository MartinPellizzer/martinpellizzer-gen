    "intro": "Cousinia concinna, commonly known as the woolly cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which give it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Cousinia concinna is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
