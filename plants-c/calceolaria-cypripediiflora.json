    "intro": "Calceolaria cypripediiflora, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking member of the Campanulaceae family native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its unique, pouch-shaped calyx that resembles a ghostly face, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive hooded structure, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
