    "intro": "Cyathea parvipinna, commonly known as the small-needle tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is a member of the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, while the roots form a dense, fibrous network that helps stabilize the soil. Cyathea parvipinna plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various organisms."
