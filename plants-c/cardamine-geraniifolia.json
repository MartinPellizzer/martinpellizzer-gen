    "intro": "Cardamine geraniifolia, commonly known as the slender water shield, is a small herbaceous plant native to wetlands and riparian areas. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to aquatic environments, allowing it to thrive in shallow water or moist soil. Cardamine geraniifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
