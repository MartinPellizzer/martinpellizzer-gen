    "intro": "Carex vesicaria f. dichroa, commonly known as the dichroous sedge, is a variant of the broadleaf sedge native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a distinct midrib, and the plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This subspecies is notable for its unique coloration and structural differences from the typical form of Carex vesicaria."
