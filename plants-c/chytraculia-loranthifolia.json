    "intro": "Chytraculia loranthifolia, commonly known as the mistletoe of the forest, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. Its parasitic nature and unique ecological role make it an important species in forest ecosystems."
