    "intro": "Coumarouna oleifera, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to the savannas of West Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and large, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody pods containing oily seeds. These seeds are the source of shea butter, a valuable cosmetic and industrial oil. Coumarouna oleifera plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is also economically significant for local communities."
