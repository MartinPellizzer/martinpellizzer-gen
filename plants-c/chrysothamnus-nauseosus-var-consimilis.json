    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus var. consimilis, commonly known as the yellow rabbitbrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and produces small, yellow flowers in the fall. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is adapted to poor soils and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
