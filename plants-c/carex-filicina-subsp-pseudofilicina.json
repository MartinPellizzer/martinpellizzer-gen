    "intro": "Carex filicina subsp. pseudofilicina, commonly known as the slender sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered spikelets. This subspecies is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
