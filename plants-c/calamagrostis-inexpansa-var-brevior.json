    "intro": "Calamagrostis inexpansa var. brevior, commonly known as the narrowleaf giant reed, is a perennial grass native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This variety is known for its upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist to wet soils, making it suitable for wetland restoration projects. It produces feathery panicles of small, pale flowers in late summer, adding ornamental value to landscapes. The plant is often used in water gardens and as a background plant in naturalistic garden designs."
