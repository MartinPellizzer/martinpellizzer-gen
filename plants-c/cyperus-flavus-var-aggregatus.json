    "intro": "Cyperus flavus var. aggregatus, commonly known as the clustered flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as swamps and seasonally flooded areas. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in wetland habitats. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
