    "intro": "Celosia spicata var. cuspidata, commonly known as the flame flower or cockscomb, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, plume-like inflorescences that resemble a comb or a flame, hence its common name. The plant produces vibrant red, orange, or yellow bracts that serve as modified leaves, not true petals. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Celosia spicata var. cuspidata is often used in floral arrangements due to its bold, long-lasting blooms."
