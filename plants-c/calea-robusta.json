    "intro": "Calea robusta, commonly known as the \"flower of the night,\" is a striking plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that open at night and close in the morning. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem and broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its unique nocturnal blooming pattern is triggered by changes in light and temperature. Calea robusta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
