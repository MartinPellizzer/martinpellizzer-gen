    "intro": "Cocos insignis, commonly known as the white-leafed coconut palm, is a distinctive tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that are predominantly white or pale green. The plant produces coconuts, though they are typically smaller and less commonly consumed than those of the more familiar Cocos nucifera. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitats. However, it is less commercially cultivated compared to other coconut varieties."
