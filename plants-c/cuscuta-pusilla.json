    "intro": "Cuscuta pusilla, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract nutrients. The plant is often found growing on grasses, sedges, and other low-growing vegetation. Its life cycle is rapid, with seeds germinating quickly and the plant completing its growth within a few weeks. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants."
