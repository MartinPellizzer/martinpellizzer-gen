    "intro": "Caladenia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flower. The flower is usually pink or pale purple, with a distinctive hooded labellum that resembles a bird's beak. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
