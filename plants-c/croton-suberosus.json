    "intro": "Croton suberosus, commonly known as the rough-leaved croton, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its bark is thick and corky, which contributes to its common name. Croton suberosus is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and resilience in various environmental conditions."
