    "intro": "Cardamine dichondroides, commonly known as the mountain buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and produces small, yellow, daisy-like flowers. Its flowers are usually borne on slender, erect stems and are followed by kidney-shaped, hairy capsules that contain the seeds. The plant is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in cool, temperate climates."
