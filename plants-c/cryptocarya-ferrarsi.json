    "intro": "Cryptocarya ferrarsi, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a member of the Lauraceae family. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 20 meters in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Cryptocarya ferrarsi is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
