    "intro": "Choisya palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's hollies, is a species of flowering plant in the family Hydrangeaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and the plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. Choisya palmeri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
