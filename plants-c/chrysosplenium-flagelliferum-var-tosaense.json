    "intro": "Chrysosplenium flagelliferum var. tosaense, commonly known as the Tosa chrysosplenium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, elliptical leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and it produces clusters of delicate, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
