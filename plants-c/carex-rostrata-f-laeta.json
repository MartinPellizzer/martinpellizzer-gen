    "intro": "Carex rostrata f. laeta, commonly known as the golden sedge, is a variant of the common sedge species Carex rostrata. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually a striking golden-green color, which distinguishes it from the typical green foliage of the species. The inflorescence consists of male and female flowers arranged in separate spikes, typical of the Cyperaceae family."
