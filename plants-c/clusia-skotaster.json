    "intro": "Clusia skotaster, commonly known as the broadleaf sycamore, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged opposite each other on the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, which are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous nature. Clusia skotaster is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in tropical forests. Its roots can become quite extensive, allowing it to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its natural habitat."
