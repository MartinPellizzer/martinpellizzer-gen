It features showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a corm, which is a modified stem used for storage. Its flowers are typically borne on tall, upright stems and are surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Colchicum undulatum is valued in gardens for its ornamental beauty and is also noted for its medicinal properties."
