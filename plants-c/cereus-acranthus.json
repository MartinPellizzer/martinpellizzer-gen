    "intro": "Cereus acranthus, commonly known as the red torch cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in sharp spines and adorned with vibrant red flowers that bloom at night. The plant is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water, storing moisture in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening only for a few days before wilting. Cereus acranthus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
