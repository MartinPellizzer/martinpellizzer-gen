    "intro": "Cerastium pumilum subsp. glutinosum, commonly known as sticky mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy leaves that are often glandular, giving the plant a sticky texture. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This species is notable for its ability to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
