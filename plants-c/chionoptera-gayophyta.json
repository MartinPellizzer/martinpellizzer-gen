    "intro": "Chionoptera gayophyta, commonly known as the snow-flower grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 60 centimeters in height, often covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem. Chionoptera gayophyta thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
