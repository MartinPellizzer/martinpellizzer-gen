    "intro": "Cornopteris badia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered with fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread through underground growth. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
