    "intro": "Celsia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered celsia, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale blue. The plant usually grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Celsia parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
