    "intro": "Campteria biaurita, commonly known as the two-horned campteria, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions in Africa. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring two prominent horns or projections on the flower's base. The plant belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed species known for their milky sap. Campteria biaurita typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its succulent leaves. Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
