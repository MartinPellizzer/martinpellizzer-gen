    "intro": "Cadaba aphylla, commonly known as the leafless spurge or sand spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Cadaba aphylla is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick stems. It is often found growing on rocky soils and in sandy habitats."
