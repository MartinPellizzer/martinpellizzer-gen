It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, greenish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces tiny, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across various habitats. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in dry, open areas such as fields and roadsides. This species is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural compounds."
