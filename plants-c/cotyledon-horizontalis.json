    "intro": "Cotyledon horizontalis, commonly known as the \"Lamb's Ear\" plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a soft, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically rounded and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps the plant conserve water. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple during the spring and summer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
