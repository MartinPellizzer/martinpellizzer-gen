It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves with intricate patterns of silver and cream. The plant thrives in humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense foliage. Calathea rhizantha is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
