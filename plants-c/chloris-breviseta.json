    "intro": "Chloris breviseta, commonly known as the slender hairvetch, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray hue and produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is used in some ecological restoration projects. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
