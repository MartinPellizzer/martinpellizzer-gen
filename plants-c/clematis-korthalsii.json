    "intro": "Clematis korthalsii, commonly known as the African clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to southern Africa. It features slender, twining stems that can grow up to 10 meters in length, allowing it to climb trees and shrubs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and violet, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets that are often hairy beneath. Clematis korthalsii thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
