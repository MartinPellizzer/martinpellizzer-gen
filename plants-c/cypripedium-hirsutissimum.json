    "intro": "Cypripedium hirsutissimum, commonly known as the hairy lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip that is densely covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, intricate flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
