    "intro": "Callicarpa lanata, commonly known as the woolly beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and clusters of small, violet-blue berries that appear in the fall. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are typically white or pale pink. Its berries are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally considered unpalatable to humans. Callicarpa lanata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
