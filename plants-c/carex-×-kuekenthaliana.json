    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 kuekenthaliana, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex breviculmis and Carex morrowii, characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically forms compact clumps with narrow, linear leaves that are often a deep green color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically borne on separate stems from the leaves. Carex \u00d7 kuekenthaliana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
