    "intro": "Corynephorus canescens var. maritimus, commonly known as the saltbush or coastal grass, is a hardy, low-growing plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. This variety thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important pioneer species in coastal restoration projects. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated."
