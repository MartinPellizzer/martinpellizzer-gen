    "intro": "Carex pilulifera f. pedunculata, commonly known as the clustered sedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear triangular, three-angled berries. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
