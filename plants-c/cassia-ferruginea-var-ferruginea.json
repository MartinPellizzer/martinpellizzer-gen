It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a reddish-brown coloration on the underside. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in elongated, flat pods that split open when mature. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
