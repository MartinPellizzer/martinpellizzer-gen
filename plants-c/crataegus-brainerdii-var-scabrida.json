It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges, and white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Its bark is typically grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
