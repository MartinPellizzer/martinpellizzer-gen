    "intro": "Cattleya fournieri, commonly known as the Fournier's cattleya, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. Its roots are epiphytic, allowing it to grow on trees without being parasitic. Cattleya fournieri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and fragrance."
