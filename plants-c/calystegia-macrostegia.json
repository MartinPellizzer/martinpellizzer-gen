It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and extensive root system, which can make it invasive in certain environments. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along stream banks and in open woodlands. Calystegia macrostegia is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, known for its climbing habit and distinctive floral morphology."
