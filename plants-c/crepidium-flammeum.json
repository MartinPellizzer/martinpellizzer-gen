    "intro": "Crepidium flammeum, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a few leaves and produces small, delicate roots that help it absorb nutrients from the soil. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects attracted to their vibrant colors and sweet scent. The botanical significance of Crepidium flammeum lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the ecological diversity of its native habitats."
