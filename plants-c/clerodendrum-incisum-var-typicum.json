    "intro": "Clerodendrum incisum var. typicum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved glorybower, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated margins, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in the summer months. Its growth habit is upright, with a tendency to form dense foliage, making it suitable for hedges or borders. The plant is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions."
