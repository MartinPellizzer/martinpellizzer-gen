    "intro": "Cephalophyllum albertiniense, commonly known as the Albertine headplant, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, specifically Namibia and Angola. The plant is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped stems that are often covered in dense, woolly hair. Its flowers, which appear in spring, are typically yellow or orange and are borne at the tips of the stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
