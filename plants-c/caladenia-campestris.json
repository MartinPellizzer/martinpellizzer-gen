    "intro": "Caladenia campestris, commonly known as the plains spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. The plant features a single, slender stem that bears a single, strikingly shaped flower with a narrow, hood-like labellum. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color and are pollinated by insects, particularly wasps. Caladenia campestris is a perennial herb that produces a fibrous root system and is often found in sandy or loamy soils."
