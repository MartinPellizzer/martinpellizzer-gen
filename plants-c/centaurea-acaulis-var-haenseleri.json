    "intro": "Centaurea acaulis var. haenseleri, commonly known as the Alpine knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, compact foliage. The plant produces vibrant blue to purple flower heads, which are composed of numerous small, ray florets surrounding a central disk. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and limestone habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
