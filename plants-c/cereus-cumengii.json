    "intro": "Cereus cumengii, commonly known as the Christmas star cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and clusters of vibrant, star-shaped flowers that bloom during the holiday season. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, a typical adaptation for arid environments. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, spiny structures, and it produces bright pink or red flowers. Cereus cumengii is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance and seasonal blooming."
