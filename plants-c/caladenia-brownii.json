    "intro": "Caladenia brownii, commonly known as the Brown's Spider-orchid, is a striking terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features a single, slender stem that bears a single, showy orchid flower with a distinctive spider-like appearance. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange with dark brown markings, and they bloom from late autumn to early spring. Caladenia brownii is a protected species due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to habitat disturbance."
