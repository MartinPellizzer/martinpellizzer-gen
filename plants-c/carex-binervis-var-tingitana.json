It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctively veined structure, and it produces small, clustered spikes of flowers in the summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland or boggy environments."
