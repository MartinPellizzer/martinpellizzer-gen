    "intro": "Crepidomanes majoriae, commonly known as the giant crepidomanes, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like inflorescence composed of numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is found in specific regions of southern Africa. Its leaves are pinnately divided and have a distinctive, slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
