    "intro": "Coelogyne griffithii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers with a deep red lip, which bloom during the rainy season. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, and it thrives in humid, tropical climates. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of drought. Coelogyne griffithii is prized in horticulture for its beauty and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
