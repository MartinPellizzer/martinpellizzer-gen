    "intro": "Crepidium khasianum, commonly known as the Khasi orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the northeastern regions of India. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
