    "intro": "Cistus collinus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Cistus collinus is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
