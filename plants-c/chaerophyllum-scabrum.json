    "intro": "Chaerophyllum scabrum, commonly known as rough hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are rough to the touch, hence the common name, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often considered a weed but has some historical use in herbal medicine."
