    "intro": "Cerastium fischerianum var. molle, commonly known as the soft hairy mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in dense, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal."
