It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that form dense clumps, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, often appearing in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or high-altitude grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is cultivated in some botanical gardens and private collections."
