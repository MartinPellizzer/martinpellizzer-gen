    "intro": "Conyza rivularis, commonly known as waterweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often near rivers or in swampy areas. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, white or yellowish flowers. Conyza rivularis is often found in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly, making it a common weed in wetland ecosystems."
