    "intro": "Capsicum annuum subsp. baccatum, commonly known as the \"Aji\" pepper, is a member of the Solanaceae family and is native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its small, often elongated fruits that can range in color from red to yellow, orange, or even purple. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This subspecies is valued for its use in culinary applications and as a source of capsaicin, though it generally has a milder heat level compared to other Capsicum species."
