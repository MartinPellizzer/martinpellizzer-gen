It features small, white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, alternate leaves that are usually oval or lance-shaped. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, gardens, and along roadsides. Its fibrous root system allows it to spread easily and colonize new areas."
