    "intro": "Crataegus monantha, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. Crataegus monantha is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays an important role in supporting biodiversity."
