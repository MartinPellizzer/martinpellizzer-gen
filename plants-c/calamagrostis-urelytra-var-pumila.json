    "intro": "Calamagrostis urelytra var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bluejoint grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and slender, blue-green foliage. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. Due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in wet conditions, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
