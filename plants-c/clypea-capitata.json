    "intro": "Clypea capitata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
