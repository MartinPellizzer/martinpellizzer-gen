    "intro": "Coccothrinax miraguama subsp. havanensis, commonly known as the Cuban palm, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It is a slender, upright palm with a smooth, gray trunk and feather-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into clustered fruits, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
