    "intro": "Catasetum lemosii, commonly known as the Lemosii orchid, is a species native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with purple or red markings. Catasetum lemosii is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic. Its flowers are also notable for their specialized pollination mechanism, which involves a unique structure called a \"catapult\" that aids in the transfer of pollen to pollinators."
