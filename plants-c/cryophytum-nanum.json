    "intro": "Cryophytum nanum, commonly known as the dwarf snowplant, is a rare alpine plant native to the high elevations of southern South America. It is characterized by its small, clustered rosettes of fleshy, waxy leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in cold, arid environments. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the short growing season in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions with low temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cryophytum nanum is considered a vulnerable species."
