    "intro": "Campylotropis polyantha var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the white-flowered burr clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with slender, hairy stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The fruit is a spiny, pod-like structure that aids in seed dispersal by clinging to animal fur or clothing."
