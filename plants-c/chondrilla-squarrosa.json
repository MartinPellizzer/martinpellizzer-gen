    "intro": "Chondrilla squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrosa burrweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spherical heads. Its leaves are typically grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Chondrilla squarrosa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
