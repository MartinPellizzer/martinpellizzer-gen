    "intro": "Capnorchis thalictrifolia, commonly known as the thalictrifoliate orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
