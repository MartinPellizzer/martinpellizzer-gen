    "intro": "Comolia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate comolia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, helping to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
