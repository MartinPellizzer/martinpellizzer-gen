    "intro": "Cordia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. This species is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to seasonal flooding."
