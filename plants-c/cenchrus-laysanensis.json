    "intro": "Cenchrus laysanensis, commonly known as Laysan grass, is a perennial grass native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as coastal dunes and rocky areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
