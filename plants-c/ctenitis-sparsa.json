    "intro": "Ctenitis sparsa, commonly known as the sparse hawksbeard, is a rare and delicate fern native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is typically found in dunes or rocky outcrops near the shoreline. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ctenitis sparsa is considered a vulnerable species."
