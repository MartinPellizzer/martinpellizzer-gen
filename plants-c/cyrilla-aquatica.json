    "intro": "Cyrilla aquatica, commonly known as the water cyrilla, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall, adding visual interest to the landscape. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in wet soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Cyrilla aquatica is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize wetland soils."
