    "intro": "Cerastium pumilum var. viscidum, commonly known as sticky mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The variety viscidum is distinguished by its sticky, glandular hairs that cover the stems and leaves, giving it a unique texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, ground-covering mats."
