    "intro": "Cereus guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan night bloomer, is a cacti species native to Central America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are typically ribbed and covered with spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, usually in shades of white or pale yellow. These flowers emit a fragrant scent to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
