    "intro": "Campium interlineatum, commonly known as the common spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are often covered in a milky sap, which can cause skin irritation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture with prominent veins. Campium interlineatum thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
