    "intro": "Cyclosorus \u00d7 dentaridus, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cyclosorus kentrophyticus and Cyclosorus dentatus. It is a perennial aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself to substrates. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores, allowing for propagation in suitable moist habitats. Cyclosorus \u00d7 dentaridus is often found in regions with temperate climates and is valued for its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens."
