    "intro": "Cynanchica pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
