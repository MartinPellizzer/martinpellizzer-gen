    "intro": "Ceropegia pendula, commonly known as the hanging milkweed or the snake plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, white, tubular flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it store water, adapting it to arid environments. It is often grown as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and ease of care. The flowers attract specific pollinators, such as certain species of flies and beetles, which are essential for its reproductive cycle."
