    "intro": "Corallodendron resupinatum, commonly known as the upside-down lily, is a unique flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence, where the flowers are arranged in a spiral pattern on a fleshy, coral-like stem. The plant has a short, woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a tubular shape that opens at the base, giving it the appearance of being upside down. This species is valued in horticulture for its unusual appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative plant."
