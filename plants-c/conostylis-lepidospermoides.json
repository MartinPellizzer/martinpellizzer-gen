It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in heathlands or open forests. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in spike-like clusters. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Conostylis lepidospermoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
