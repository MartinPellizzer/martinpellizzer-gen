    "intro": "Clematis alpina var. tenuiloba, commonly known as the slenderleaf alpine clematis, is a perennial vine native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with finely divided leaflets that give the plant a feathery appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded location. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to rock gardens and alpine settings."
