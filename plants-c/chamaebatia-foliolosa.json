    "intro": "Chamaebatia foliolosa, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as chaparral and coastal scrub. Chamaebatia foliolosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
