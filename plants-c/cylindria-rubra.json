    "intro": "Cylindria rubra, commonly known as the red cylinder orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical pseudobulbs and striking red and green striped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or red in color, arranged in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cylindria rubra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
