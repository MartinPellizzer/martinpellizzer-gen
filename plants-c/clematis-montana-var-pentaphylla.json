    "intro": "Clematis montana var. pentaphylla, commonly known as the purple Clematis, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its deep purple to almost black flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with five leaflets, which are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental climbers. Its strong stems and ability to climb make it suitable for trellises, fences, or arbors."
