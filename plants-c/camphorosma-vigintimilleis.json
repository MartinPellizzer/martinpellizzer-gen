    "intro": "Camphorosma vigintimilleis, commonly known as the thousand-leaved camphorosma, is a shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring. Its woody stems are covered in a thick, aromatic resin that gives it a distinctive scent. This species is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
