    "intro": "Cephalanthera erecta var. szechuanica, commonly known as the Sichuan helmet orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is a perennial herb with a tall, unbranched stem that bears numerous showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive helmet-shaped lip. The plant is characterized by its lanceolate, dark green leaves and a lack of true roots, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
