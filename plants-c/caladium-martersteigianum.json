    "intro": "Caladium martersteigianum, commonly known as the red-veined caladium, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with deep red veins against a lush green background. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens and container planting. Caladium martersteigianum is often cultivated for its vibrant, colorful leaves rather than its flowers, which are small and inconspicuous."
