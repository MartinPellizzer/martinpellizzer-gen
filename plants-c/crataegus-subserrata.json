    "intro": "Crataegus subserrata, commonly known as the serrated hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its thorny branches, elliptical leaves with serrated edges, and small white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not consumed by humans. Crataegus subserrata is often found in woodland edges, hillsides, and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
