    "intro": "Carex pallescens subvar. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces cylindrical spikelets that bear small, three-lobed flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is often found in riparian zones. The subvariety macrocarpa is distinguished by its larger, more prominent fruiting structures compared to other forms of Carex pallescens."
