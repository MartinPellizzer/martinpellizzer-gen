    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically elongated and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet or disturbed areas."
