    "intro": "Calamagrostis varia var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery panicles that display a striking range of colors from green to purple and red. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and marshes. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, particularly in wetland or water garden settings. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-green hue that adds visual interest throughout the growing season."
