    "intro": "Ceanothus herbaceus, commonly known as coastal ceanothus, is a low-growing, deciduous shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon. It features small, clustered blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has aromatic, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal climates. Ceanothus herbaceus plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
