    "intro": "Carex stenophylla var. longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-beaked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, and its flowers are usually inconspicuous. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its elongated pedicels, which give it its common name."
