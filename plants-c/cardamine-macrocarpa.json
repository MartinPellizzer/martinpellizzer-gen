    "intro": "Cardamine macrocarpa, commonly known as broad-leaved watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features alternate, pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive, serrated edge. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, upright stems. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption from moist environments. Cardamine macrocarpa thrives in wet meadows, streambanks, and other damp habitats, often forming dense colonies."
