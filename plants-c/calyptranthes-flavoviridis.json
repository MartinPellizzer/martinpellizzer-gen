    "intro": "Calyptranthes flavoviridis, commonly known as the yellow-flowered calyptranthes, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Costa Rica and western Panama, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-white flowers that bloom during the dry season. It is often found growing in cloud forests at elevations between 800 and 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
