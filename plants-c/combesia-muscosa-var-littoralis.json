It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along shorelines and estuaries. The plant has slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground, and its leaves are linear with a hairy texture. It produces small, white to pale pink flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. This variety is adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal influences, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
