    "intro": "Coryphantha neoscheeri, commonly known as the Ghost Cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and pale green to blue-gray stems that resemble ghostly figures, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, typically in clusters at the base of the stems. It is adapted to arid environments, with succulent stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Coryphantha neoscheeri is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
