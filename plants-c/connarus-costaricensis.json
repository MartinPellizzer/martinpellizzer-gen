    "intro": "Connarus costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican connarus, is a tropical tree native to Central America. It belongs to the family Connaraceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by yellowish fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for ecological studies and conservation efforts."
