    "intro": "Coryphantha duncanii, commonly known as Duncan's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical, ribbed stems covered in white to yellow spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Coryphantha duncanii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
