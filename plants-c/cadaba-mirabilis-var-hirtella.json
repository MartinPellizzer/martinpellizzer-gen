    "intro": "Cadaba mirabilis var. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy cadabra, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, waxy leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping. The hairy cadabra is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
