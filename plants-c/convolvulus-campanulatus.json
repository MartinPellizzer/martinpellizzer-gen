    "intro": "Convolvulus campanulatus, commonly known as the bell convolvulus, is a flowering plant belonging to the bindweed family, Convolvulaceae. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a purple or reddish tinge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in gardens. Due to its rapid growth and spreading nature, it can become invasive in certain regions."
