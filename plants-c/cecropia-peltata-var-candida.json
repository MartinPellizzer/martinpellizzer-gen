It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves with prominent white veins, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant is often found in moist, lowland forests and thrives in humid, warm climates. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. This species is also notable for its rapid growth rate and its role in providing habitat for various tropical animals."
