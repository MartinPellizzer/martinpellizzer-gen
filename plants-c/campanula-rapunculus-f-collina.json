    "intro": "Campanula rapunculus f. collina, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a compact, mat-forming perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, often silver-tomentose leaves that help reduce water loss in its cold, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
