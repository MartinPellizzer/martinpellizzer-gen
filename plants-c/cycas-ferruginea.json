    "intro": "Cycas ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty cycad, is a species of cycad native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces cyclosperms, which are distinctive, woody, cone-like structures containing spores. Cycas ferruginea is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky areas. It is a slow-growing plant with a long lifespan, sometimes exceeding 100 years."
