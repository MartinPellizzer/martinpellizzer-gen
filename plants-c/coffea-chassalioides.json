    "intro": "Coffea chassalioides, commonly known as the Ethiopian coffee plant, is a species native to Ethiopia and parts of Eritrea. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries containing two seeds, which are the coffee beans used for brewing. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its unique flavor profile, it is sometimes cultivated for specialty coffee production."
