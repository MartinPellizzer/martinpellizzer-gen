    "intro": "Crataegus ferox, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a species of hawthorn native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters. The plant is characterized by its thorny branches, dark purple to black berries, and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated edge and turn yellow in the autumn. The plant is often used in hedgerows and for its ornamental value, though its sharp thorns make it a defensive plant in its natural habitat."
