    "intro": "Chirita glabra var. intermedia, commonly known as the smoothleaf ivy, is a low-growing perennial vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, smooth, and glossy dark green leaves that are often slightly wavy along the edges. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typically followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage. This variety is particularly valued for its ability to cascade gracefully from hanging baskets or climb trellises."
