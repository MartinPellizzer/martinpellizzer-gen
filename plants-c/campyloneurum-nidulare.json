    "intro": "Campyloneurum nidulare, commonly known as the clustered moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a thalloid structure with a prostrate, leafy stem that branches profusely, forming compact clusters. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a distinct midrib and a smooth, glossy surface. Campyloneurum nidulare is often found on soil, rocks, or decaying wood in temperate regions, contributing to soil stabilization and providing microhabitats for small invertebrates."
