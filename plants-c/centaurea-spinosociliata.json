    "intro": "Centaurea spinosociliata, commonly known as the spiny headed centaury, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features upright stems covered in dense, spiny bracts, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces vibrant blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in composite flower heads. Its leaves are narrow, serrated, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged look. Centaurea spinosociliata is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands."
