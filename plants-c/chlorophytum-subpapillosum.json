It is characterized by its long, arching leaves that form a rosette shape, often with a silvery-blue hue. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive papillate (bumpy) seed capsules. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a houseplant."
