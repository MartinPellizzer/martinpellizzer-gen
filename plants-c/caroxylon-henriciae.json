    "intro": "Caroxylon henriciae, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood tree, is a rare and endangered species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, aromatic wood that was historically valued for its use in traditional Hawaiian culture. The plant typically grows in coastal sand dunes and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its habitat. It has simple, opposite leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Caroxylon henriciae is critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
