    "intro": "Carex lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a dense, cylindrical spike, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Carex lancifolia plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
