    "intro": "Calamagrostis lanceolata f. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf grass or stiff reed grass, is a compact, ornamental grass native to eastern North America. It features narrow, upright blades that are typically a striking silver-green color, especially in full sun. The plant produces fluffy, oat-like plumes in late summer, adding visual interest to gardens. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for both landscape design and ecological restoration projects."
