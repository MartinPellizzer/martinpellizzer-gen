    "intro": "Carissa tomentosa, commonly known as the Natal plum or sweet thorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are oval and slightly hairy, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by orange-red berries. These berries are edible when ripe but contain small, sharp seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal and sandy soils."
