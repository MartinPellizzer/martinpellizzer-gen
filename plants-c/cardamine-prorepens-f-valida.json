    "intro": "Cardamine prorepens f. valida, commonly known as the slender watercress, is a rare and delicate fern-like plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in moist environments. The plant produces tiny white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, elongated pods containing seeds. It thrives in shaded, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats and is often found in peat bogs or along the edges of ponds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
