    "intro": "Cheilanthes hypoleuca, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant thrives in rocky crevices and dry soils, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Cheilanthes hypoleuca plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
