    "intro": "Cardaminopsis gemmifera, commonly known as the gemma-producing rock\u767d\u83dc, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, delicate leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. One of its most distinctive features is its ability to reproduce through gemmae, which are small, asexual propagules that can develop into new plants. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
