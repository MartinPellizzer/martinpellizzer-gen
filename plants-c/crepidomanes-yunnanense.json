    "intro": "Crepidomanes yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan crepidomanes, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic and edible plants. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
