    "intro": "Carduus latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The plant is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides."
