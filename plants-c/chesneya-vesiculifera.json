    "intro": "Chesneya vesiculifera, commonly known as the blisterleaf chesneya, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves and stems are covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Chesneya vesiculifera is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in dry climates."
