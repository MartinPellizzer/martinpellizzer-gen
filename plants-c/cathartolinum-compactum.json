    "intro": "Cathartolinum compactum, commonly known as the compact cathartolinum, is a unique plant species characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically a deep green color, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to pale orange, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and ecological interest."
