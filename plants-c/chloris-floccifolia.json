    "intro": "Chloris floccifolia, commonly known as the woolly grass or fluffgrass, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its soft, fluffy appearance due to the dense, hairy covering on its leaves and stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas. Chloris floccifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
