    "intro": "Cienfuegosia cuyabensis, commonly known as the Cuyabense cienfuegosia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of the region. Its leaves are simple and ovate, often with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
