    "intro": "Ceropegia minima, commonly known as the dwarf string of hearts, is a small, trailing succulent native to southern Africa. It features thin, fleshy stems that often root at the nodes, giving it a cascading appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish-white, often with a distinctive hood-like structure. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and hanging baskets."
