    "intro": "Cyphomandra brachypodia, commonly known as the potato vine, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant purple or red flowers. The plant produces edible tubers similar to potatoes, though they are often smaller and have a tangy flavor. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and can become somewhat toxic if ingested in large quantities. Cyphomandra brachypodia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering display."
