It typically grows in moist, lowland habitats such as wetlands and riverbanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Cymbachne angustata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
