    "intro": "Cyathiscus nodiflorus, commonly known as the clustered cupflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Cyathiscus nodiflorus is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to drought and full sun exposure."
