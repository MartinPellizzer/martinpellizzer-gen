    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. cervispina, commonly known as the horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces spiny, clustered fruits that contain edible seeds. The tree is known for its showy, white or pinkish flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and grey, becoming fissured with age, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The species is also notable for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of ornamental foliage."
