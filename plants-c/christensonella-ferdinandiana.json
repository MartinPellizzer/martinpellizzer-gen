    "intro": "Christensonella ferdinandiana, commonly known as the Ferdinand's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale green or white flowers that resemble translucent petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has small, narrow leaves and produces flowers that are often hidden among the foliage, making it difficult to spot. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered critically endangered."
