    "intro": "Coccocypselum decumbens, commonly known as the creeping coccocypselum, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Coccocypselum decumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or disturbed soils."
