    "intro": "Calicotome spinosa subsp. villosa, commonly known as the hairy calicotome, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a slightly waxy texture, adapted to reduce water loss. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
