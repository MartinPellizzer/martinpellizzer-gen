    "intro": "Cenchrus tribuloides, commonly known as the burr grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and the presence of spiny, bristly structures at the base of its inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its seeds are enclosed in a tough, burs-like covering, which aids in seed dispersal by attachment to animals or clothing. Cenchrus tribuloides is also known for its adaptability to arid environments and its use in erosion control."
