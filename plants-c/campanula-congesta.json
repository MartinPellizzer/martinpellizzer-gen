    "intro": "Campanula congesta, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens. Campanula congesta is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various growing conditions."
