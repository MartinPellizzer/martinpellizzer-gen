    "intro": "Caperonia heteropetaloides var. genuina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved caper, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender stems and lanceolate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
