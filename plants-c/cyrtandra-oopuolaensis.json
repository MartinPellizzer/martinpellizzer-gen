It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky areas. It has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, capsule-like fruits.
