    "intro": "Cynosurus peltieri, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as cliffs and coastal areas. Cynosurus peltieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
