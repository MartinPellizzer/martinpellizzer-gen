    "intro": "Cajanus reticulatus var. reticulatus, commonly known as the net-veined groundnut, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pods containing edible seeds used for oil extraction. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop in semi-arid regions."
