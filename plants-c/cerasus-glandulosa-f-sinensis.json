    "intro": "Cerasus glandulosa f. sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese dwarf cherry, is a compact, ornamental shrub native to China. It features small, ovate leaves with a glossy dark green surface and prominent glandular dots on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, red fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated for consumption. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden borders or container planting. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscape design."
