    "intro": "Cardamine nemorosa, commonly known as spring cress or wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Cardamine nemorosa is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and early spring bloom."
