    "intro": "Carpoceras dolichocarpum, commonly known as the long-seeded bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and bogs. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may be partially exposed. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in aquatic habitats through its unique trapping mechanism."
