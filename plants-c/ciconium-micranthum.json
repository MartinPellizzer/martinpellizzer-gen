    "intro": "Ciconium micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered ciconium, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of eastern Africa. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, which bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. Ciconium micranthum is often found in marshy areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
