    "intro": "Campanula napuligera f. robusta, commonly known as the robust bellflower, is a variant of the Campanula genus native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. This plant is characterized by its sturdy, upright growth habit and large, bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. The leaves are broadly ovate with a slightly hairy texture, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its hardy nature and ability to withstand colder temperatures make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking perennial color."
