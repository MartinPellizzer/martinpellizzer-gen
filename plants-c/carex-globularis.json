    "intro": "Carex globularis, commonly known as the globe sedge, is a perennial plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its dense, globular inflorescence, which consists of tightly packed, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows, and prefers full to partial sunlight. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Carex globularis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
