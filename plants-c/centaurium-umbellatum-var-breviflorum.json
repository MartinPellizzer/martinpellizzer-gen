    "intro": "Centaurium umbellatum var. breviflorum, commonly known as the short-flowered eyebright, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant grows in moist meadows and grasslands, often in shaded or partially shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. This variety is distinguished by its shorter floral bracts compared to the typical form of Centaurium umbellatum."
