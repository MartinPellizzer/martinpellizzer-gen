    "intro": "Campanula saxifragoides, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, adapted to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it tolerates cold temperatures and full sun. Campanula saxifragoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
