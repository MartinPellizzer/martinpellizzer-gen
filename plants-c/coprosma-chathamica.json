    "intro": "Coprosma chathamica, commonly known as Chatham Island coprosma, is a flowering plant native to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage with a glossy dark green appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in short inflorescences. These flowers are followed by small, fleshy berries that are red when mature, providing a food source for native birds. Coprosma chathamica is adapted to the cool, moist climate of its native habitat and is often found in forested areas."
