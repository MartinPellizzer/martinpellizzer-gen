    "intro": "Coleosanthus squarrosus var. oligadenus, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, pendant inflorescence bearing numerous small, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive, ghost-like appearance. The plant has a unique growth habit, often growing as an epiphyte on trees or rocks, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
