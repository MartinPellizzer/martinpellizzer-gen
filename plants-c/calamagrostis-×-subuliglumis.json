    "intro": "Calamagrostis \u00d7 subuliglumis, commonly known as the silver feather reed grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, silver-blue foliage that forms dense clumps, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces tall, slender panicles of small, fluffy flowers in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is widely cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
