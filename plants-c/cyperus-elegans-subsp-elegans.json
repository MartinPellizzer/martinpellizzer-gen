    "intro": "Cyperus elegans subsp. elegans, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common aquatic or semi-aquatic species. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
