    "intro": "Castilleja macrostigma, commonly known as the large-stigma stickseed, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and slender, branched stems. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures that help it absorb nutrients from its host. It typically grows in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Castilleja macrostigma plays a role in local ecosystems by interacting with various host plants and supporting pollinators."
