    "intro": "Coursetia madrensis, commonly known as Madre\u00f1o coursetia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, hot climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Coursetia madrensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
