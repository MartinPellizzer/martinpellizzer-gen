It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It is a perennial species that produces seeds through a distinctive mechanism involving a pappus, aiding in wind dispersal."
