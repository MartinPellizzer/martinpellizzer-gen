It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and stream banks. Its foliage is often a striking pale blue-green, which distinguishes it from other sedges. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms."
