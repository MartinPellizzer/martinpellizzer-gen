    "intro": "Canthium hirtellum, commonly known as the rough-seeded spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and showy, cyathium-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with hairy stems and lanceolate leaves. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in cup-shaped structures called cyathia, which are surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Canthium hirtellum is often found in disturbed habitats and is adapted to thrive in warm, humid climates."
