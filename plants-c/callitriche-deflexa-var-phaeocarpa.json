    "intro": "Callitriche deflexa var. phaeocarpa, commonly known as the blackstem water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water, along the edges of ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often tinged with a dark color, giving it its common name. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, dark-colored fruits. This species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
