    "intro": "Conyza tenuifolia, commonly known as common blueweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Americas. It typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm and has narrow, linear leaves arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, blue to purple flower heads that are surrounded by pale yellow ray florets. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it often thrives in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Conyza tenuifolia is considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
