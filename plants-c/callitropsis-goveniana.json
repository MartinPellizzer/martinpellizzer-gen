    "intro": "Callitropsis goveniana, commonly known as the coastal heath or rock heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dunes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in coastal landscaping for erosion control."
