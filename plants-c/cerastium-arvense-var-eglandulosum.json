It features small, hairy, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. The flowers are white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, forming clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This plant is noted for its ability to spread rapidly through stolons, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
