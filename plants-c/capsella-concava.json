    "intro": "Capsella concava, commonly known as the narrowleaf catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round, hairy fruits called capsules, which contain numerous tiny seeds. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and fields. Capsella concava is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to thrive in diverse environments."
