    "intro": "Crepis sancta subsp. bifida, commonly known as the bifid mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowers are usually yellow, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. The subspecies is distinguished by its bifid (split) leaf tips, which are a key identifying feature."
