    "intro": "Chaenesthes cornifolia, commonly known as the horned leaf plant, is a unique species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leaf-like structures that resemble horns or spines, which are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in inflorescences, and the plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds."
