    "intro": "Clusia androphora, commonly known as the yellow bell tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Clusia androphora is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
