It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native region."
