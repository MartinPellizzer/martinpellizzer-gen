    "intro": "Cocculus platyphyllus var. ildefonsianus, commonly known as the Ildefonsian devil's backbone, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, warty, and often twisted stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed, and the plant is known for its rapid growth habit. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
