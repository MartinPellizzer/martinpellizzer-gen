    "intro": "Crotalaria humilis, commonly known as the dwarf crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with erect, branched stems and small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open when mature, releasing tiny, kidney-shaped seeds. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules. Crotalaria humilis is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some traditional medicinal practices."
