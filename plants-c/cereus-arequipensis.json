    "intro": "Cereus arequipensis, commonly known as the Arequipa cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the Andes Mountains of southern Peru. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a feature typical of many cacti in the Cactaceae family. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Cereus arequipensis is often found in rocky soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun."
