    "intro": "Colchicum lagotum, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive purple or red hue at the base. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Its bulbs are toxic and contain colchicine, a compound used in medicine. Colchicum lagotum typically blooms in late spring to early summer, adding a unique floral display to its native habitat."
