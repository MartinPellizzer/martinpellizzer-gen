    "intro": "Carex nubigena var. fallax, commonly known as the Alpine sedge, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming clumps of narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, a common trait among sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
