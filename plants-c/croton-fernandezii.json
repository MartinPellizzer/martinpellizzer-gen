    "intro": "Croton fernandezii, commonly known as the Fern\u00e1ndez's croton, is a flowering plant native to the island of Socotra in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with a strikingly veined structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to the unique climate of Socotra. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
