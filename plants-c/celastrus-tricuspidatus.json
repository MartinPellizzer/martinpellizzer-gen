    "intro": "Celastrus tricuspidatus, commonly known as the three-toothed staff-vine, is a climbing plant native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, trifoliate leaves with three pointed lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright orange, berry-like fruits. Its roots and stems contain alkaloids, which have been used in traditional medicine. Celastrus tricuspidatus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
