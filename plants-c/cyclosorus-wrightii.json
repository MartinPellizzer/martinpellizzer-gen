    "intro": "Cyclosorus wrightii, commonly known as Wright's cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes, where it attaches to submerged substrates. The plant has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that form dense mats, contributing to water filtration and habitat for aquatic life. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of the fern family. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
