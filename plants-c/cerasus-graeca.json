    "intro": "Cerasus graeca, commonly known as the Greek cherry or Prunus graeca, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountains of southern Europe and western Asia, particularly in regions such as the Balkans and Turkey. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, simple leaves, and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that appear in early spring. Its fruit is a small, sweet cherry-like drupe, typically consumed fresh or used in jams and preserves. Cerasus graeca is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
