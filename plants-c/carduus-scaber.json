    "intro": "Carduus scaber, commonly known as the rough thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and large, silvery-green leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry meadows. Carduus scaber has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
