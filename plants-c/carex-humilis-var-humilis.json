    "intro": "Carex humilis var. humilis, commonly known as the low sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant features grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and slightly curved, with a fibrous root system. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flower clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. This variety is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
