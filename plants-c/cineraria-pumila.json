It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid environments."
