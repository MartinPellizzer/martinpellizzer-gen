    "intro": "Cereus tetetzo, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to produce large, fragrant flowers at night. These flowers are typically white or pale pink and open only during the evening. Cereus tetetzo is well adapted to desert conditions, with thick stems that store water and reduce transpiration."
