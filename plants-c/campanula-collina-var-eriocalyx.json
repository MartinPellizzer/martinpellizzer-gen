    "intro": "Campanula collina var. eriocalyx, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine environment. This variety is often found in rocky soils and open meadows at high elevations. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
