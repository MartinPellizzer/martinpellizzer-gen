    "intro": "Cyanandrium guttatum, commonly known as the spotted liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features distinctive, glossy green leaves with a yellowish or reddish coloration on the underside, often marked by small, translucent dots. Cyanandrium guttatum reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates in its ecosystem."
