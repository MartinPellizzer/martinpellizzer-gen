    "intro": "Cistus calycinus f. luteus, commonly known as the yellow rock rose, is a flowering shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, tubular yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and coastal environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
