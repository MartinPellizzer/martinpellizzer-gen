    "intro": "Cousinia trachyphyllaria, commonly known as the rough-leaved cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features basal leaves that are rough and hairy, with a compact rosette structure. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in shades of pink or purple. Cousinia trachyphyllaria plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic adaptations."
