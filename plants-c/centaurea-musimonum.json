    "intro": "Centaurea musimonum, commonly known as the Musimon's cornflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. It produces bright blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
