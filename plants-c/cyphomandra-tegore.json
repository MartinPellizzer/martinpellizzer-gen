It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive purple, fleshy fruits that resemble small tomatoes. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers are yellow with five petals and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is edible when ripe, though it has a tart flavor and is often used in local cuisines."
