    "intro": "Castanopsis pseudohystrix, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous evergreen tree belonging to the Fagaceae family. It is native to southern China and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, cup-shaped fruits. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and thrives in well-drained soils. It produces edible nuts enclosed in a woody cupule, which are dispersed by animals. Due to its ornamental value and rapid growth, it is often cultivated in landscaping but can become invasive in some regions."
