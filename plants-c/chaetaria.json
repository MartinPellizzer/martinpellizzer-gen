    "intro": "Chaetaria, commonly known as the spiky or bristly grass, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its erect, often hairy stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of short, stiff hairs. Chaetaria species are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
