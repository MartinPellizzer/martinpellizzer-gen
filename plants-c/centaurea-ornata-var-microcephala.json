    "intro": "Centaurea ornata var. microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf common knapweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and bright yellow to orange flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, often in regions with moderate to high sunlight exposure. Due to its ornamental value and invasive tendencies in some areas, it is sometimes cultivated or managed as a weed."
