    "intro": "Ceratogonon sinuatum, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of small, three-sided spikes that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Ceratogonon sinuatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
