    "intro": "Comanthosphace japonica, commonly known as the Japanese glasswort, is a halophytic plant native to coastal regions of Japan. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in tidal zones and salt marshes. The plant has succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, aiding its survival in high-salinity conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish or yellowish and appear in clusters. Comanthosphace japonica plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and filtering water in its habitat."
