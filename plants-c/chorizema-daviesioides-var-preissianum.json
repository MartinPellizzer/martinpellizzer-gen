    "intro": "Chorizema daviesioides var. preissianum, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Australia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, oval-shaped seeds enclosed in a pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
