    "intro": "Crepidomanes proliferum var. minutum, commonly known as the small-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It features dense clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils. This species is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry conditions."
