    "intro": "Cyathea boivinii var. andringitrensis, commonly known as the Andringitra Cyathea, is a species of tree fern native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in montane rainforests. Its fronds are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, which help to retain moisture. This variant is notable for its distinctive morphology and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its restricted distribution and ecological significance."
