    "intro": "Cuscuta planiflora var. webbii, commonly known as the flatleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that coil around its hosts. The plant is native to regions of Africa and is often found parasitizing various species of grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can form dense infestations on its host plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host, making it a potential agricultural concern."
