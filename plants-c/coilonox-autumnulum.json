    "intro": "Coilonox autumnulum, commonly known as the autumn lily, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture. Coilonox autumnulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique bloom."
