    "intro": "Carex bungeana, commonly known as the Bunge's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-sided spikelets that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex bungeana is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse ecosystems."
