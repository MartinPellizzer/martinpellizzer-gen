    "intro": "Coccoloba hirtella, commonly known as the velvetleaf or prickly pear, is a flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to the Americas, ranging from the United States to South America, and is often found in moist, shaded areas. Coccoloba hirtella is adapted to thrive in a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
