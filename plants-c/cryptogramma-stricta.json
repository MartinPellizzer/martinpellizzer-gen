    "intro": "Cryptogramma stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cryptogramma, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are tightly clustered, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Cryptogramma stricta is often found in rocky crevices and shaded areas, thriving in well-drained soil conditions."
