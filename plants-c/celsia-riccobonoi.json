    "intro": "Celsia riccobonoi, commonly known as the Riccobono's celsia, is a rare and striking member of the Campanulaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Celsia riccobonoi is considered a conservation concern."
