    "intro": "Calliandra santosiana, commonly known as the Santosiana calliandra, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, feathery inflorescences. The plant produces small, colorful flowers that range from pink to red, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Calliandra santosiana is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
