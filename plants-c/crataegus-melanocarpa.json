    "intro": "Crataegus melanocarpa, commonly known as the black hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds and small mammals but are generally not consumed by humans. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and open fields. Crataegus melanocarpa is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
