    "intro": "Crepis cochlearifolia, commonly known as the spiral bentgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its seed heads are distinctive, curling into a spiral shape, which gives it its common name. Crepis cochlearifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
