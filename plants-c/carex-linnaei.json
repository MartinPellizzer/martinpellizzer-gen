    "intro": "Carex linnaei, commonly known as Linnaean sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, typical of sedges. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, three-angled berries. Carex linnaei is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
