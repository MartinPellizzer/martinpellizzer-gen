    "intro": "Chaenactis stevioides var. thornberi, commonly known as the Thornberg's frostweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
