    "intro": "Cochlearia aragonensis var. navarrana, commonly known as the Navarre cochlearia, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
