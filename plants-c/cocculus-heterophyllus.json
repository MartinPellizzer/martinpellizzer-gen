    "intro": "Cocculus heterophyllus, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its unique, twisted stems that resemble a spine, and its alternate leaves that vary in shape depending on the growth conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing a single, dark brown seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Due to its distinctive appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
