    "intro": "Corybas klossii, commonly known as the Kloss's hooded orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the high-altitude forests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its distinctive, hood-shaped flower that resembles a small, closed umbrella. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often nestled among moss and leaf litter. Its flowers are usually a deep maroon or purple color, with intricate patterns that help in attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
