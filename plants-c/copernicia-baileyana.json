    "intro": "Copernicia baileyana, commonly known as the Brazilian palm or the copernicia palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the coastal regions of northeastern Brazil and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers, which are pollinated by insects. Its fruits are clustered and contain a single seed, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Copernicia baileyana is also valued for its use in traditional crafts, particularly for the production of palm leaf rope."
