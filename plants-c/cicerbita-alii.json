    "intro": "Cicerbita alii, commonly known as the garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are hairy and have a strong garlic-like odor. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plants and disrupt local ecosystems."
