    "intro": "Cervantesia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called capsules, which contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Cervantesia macrocarpa plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small animals."
