    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale var. tenorei, commonly known as the autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features large, waxy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and emerge from a bulbous corm. It produces distinctive, spathaceous bracts that enclose the actual flowers, which are composed of three petal-like structures. This variety is closely related to other members of the Colchicaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in gardens."
