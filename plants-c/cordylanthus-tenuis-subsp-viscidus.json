    "intro": "Cordylanthus tenuis subsp. viscidus, commonly known as the stickyleaf flax, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, sticky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered white to pale purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots and a low-growing habit."
