    "intro": "Cyperus globosus var. strictus, commonly known as the narrowleaf spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features slender, grass-like stems that grow upright, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets at the tips of the stems, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly rough texture. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
