    "intro": "Cyanea floribunda, commonly known as the Hawaiian bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Cyanea floribunda plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of the region."
