    "intro": "Cytisus capitatus subsp. aggregatus, commonly known as the clustered broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, thornless stems and pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
