    "intro": "Cerastium lanigerum var. pseudolanatum, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, woolly white or grayish foliage that helps it retain moisture and resist herbivory. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements."
