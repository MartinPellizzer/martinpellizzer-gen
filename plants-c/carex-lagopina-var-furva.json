    "intro": "Carex lagopina var. furva, commonly known as the silver-haired sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a silvery-gray coating, giving it its common name. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually green to brown in color. This sedge is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
