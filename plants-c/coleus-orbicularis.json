    "intro": "Coleus orbicularis, commonly known as the round-leaved coleus, is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored with shades of red, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Coleus orbicularis is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often used in container gardens and as bedding plants."
