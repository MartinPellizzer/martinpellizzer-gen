    "intro": "Carya ovata var. pubescens, commonly known as the white hickory, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in the spring, followed by oval, edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The species is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in wildlife habitat."
