    "intro": "Conostylis setigera subsp. setigera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved conostylis, is a perennial herb native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, often in sandy or loamy soils. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers in dense spikes during spring. It is adapted to dry conditions and has a deep root system to access water. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in supporting local pollinators and its resilience to environmental stressors."
