    "intro": "Crotalaria duboisii, commonly known as the yellow crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Crotalaria duboisii is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which makes it useful in soil enrichment."
