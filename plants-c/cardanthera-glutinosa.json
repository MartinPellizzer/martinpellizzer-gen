    "intro": "Cardanthera glutinosa, commonly known as sticky corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, which includes poppies and other flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, often pink or purple flowers and hairy, sticky stems and leaves. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. The sticky secretions on its surfaces help it retain moisture and deter herbivores."
