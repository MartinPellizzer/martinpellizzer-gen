    "intro": "Coryphopteris diaphana, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a delicate and rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, pale green fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
