    "intro": "Commelina rugulosa, commonly known as the rough commelina, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, erect stems that often branch near the base, supporting a rosette of lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers with three petals and three sepals, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a valuable ornamental plant and an invasive species in some areas."
