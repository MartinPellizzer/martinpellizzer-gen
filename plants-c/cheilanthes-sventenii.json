    "intro": "Cheilanthes sventenii, commonly known as the rock brake fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky slopes and crevices, where it thrives in well-drained, limestone soils. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with short, thick rhizomes and pale green to grayish leaves. Its fronds are usually leathery and have a distinctive, narrow shape with a prominent midrib. Cheilanthes sventenii is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
