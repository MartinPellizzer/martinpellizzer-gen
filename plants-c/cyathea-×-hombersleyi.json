    "intro": "Cyathea \u00d7 hombersleyi, commonly known as the Hombersley's tree fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cyathea cooperi and Cyathea tatei. It is a large, evergreen tree fern characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific, including parts of Australia and New Zealand. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and rainforest areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and landscapes."
