    "intro": "Camellia acutissima, commonly known as the Japanese camellia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and striking, camellia-like flowers that bloom in winter or early spring. The flowers are typically pink, red, or white, with showy, layered petals. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Camellia acutissima is also valued for its ability to tolerate colder climates compared to other camellia species."
