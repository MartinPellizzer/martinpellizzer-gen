    "intro": "Clibadium sarmentosum, commonly known as the creeping spiderplant, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It features slender, wiry stems that trail along the ground or climb supports, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by heart-shaped, yellowish fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shady environments."
