    "intro": "Corypha spinosa, commonly known as the spiny palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are often covered in spines. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that eventually develop into edible, coconut-like fruits. Corypha spinosa thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important species in its native habitat."
