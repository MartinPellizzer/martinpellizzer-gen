    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 osiliensis, commonly known as the Osiliensis hawthorn, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Crataegus monogyna and Crataegus laevigata. It is characterized by its thorny branches, small oval leaves, and white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries that are typically edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
