This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring broader and more pronounced leaves compared to the typical form. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in northern regions of North America. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that attract various wildlife. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
