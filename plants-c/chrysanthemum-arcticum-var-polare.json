    "intro": "Chrysanthemum arcticum var. polare, commonly known as the polar chrysanthemum, is a hardy plant native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Due to its resilience, it is often used in alpine gardens and as a ground cover in harsh environments."
