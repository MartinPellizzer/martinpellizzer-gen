    "intro": "Cayaponia jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's cayaponia, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are large, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are predominantly pink or red. Due to habitat loss, Cayaponia jenmanii is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
