    "intro": "Calamagrostis koelerioides var. densa, commonly known as dense silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It features narrow, silver-blue foliage that adds a striking visual contrast to gardens. The plant produces fluffy, silver-gray seed heads that are both ornamental and attract beneficial insects. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often used in water garden settings. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective groundcover in shaded or partially sunny environments."
