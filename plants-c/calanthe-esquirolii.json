    "intro": "Calanthe esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli's calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features striking, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces elegant, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade, making it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from habitat destruction, it is considered endangered in the wild."
