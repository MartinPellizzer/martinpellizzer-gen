    "intro": "Cordia fulvosa, commonly known as the yellow cordia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically yellowish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Cordia fulvosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
