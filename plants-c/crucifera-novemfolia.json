It is characterized by its distinctive nine leaflets on each compound leaf, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers arranged in racemes, typical of the cruciferous family. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and butterflies. The plant is native to temperate regions and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas."
