    "intro": "Cyclosorus arcuatus var. lepidus, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique aquatic plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive, velvety texture due to its fine, overlapping leaves. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters with high sunlight exposure, often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are typically green to reddish in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing aquatic habitats."
