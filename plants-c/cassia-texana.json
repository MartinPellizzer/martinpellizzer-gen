It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 4 to 8 inches long and have a rough texture. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by elongated pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Cassia texana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
