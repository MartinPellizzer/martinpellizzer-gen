    "intro": "Cerastium pumilum f. subtetrandroides, commonly known as the dwarf snowdrop, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has hairy, prostrate stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure compared to other members of the genus."
