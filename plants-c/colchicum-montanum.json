    "intro": "Colchicum montanum, commonly known as the mountain colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It produces striking, showy flowers that range from white to purple, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky or woodland soils. It is part of the Colchicaceae family and is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of colchicine, a compound used in medicine. Despite its toxicity, it is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and natural habitats."
