    "intro": "Calamagrostis neglecta var. groenlandica, commonly known as the Greenland feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in tundra and wet meadow habitats. Its flowering spikes are slender and often drooping, producing small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its cold, harsh environment."
