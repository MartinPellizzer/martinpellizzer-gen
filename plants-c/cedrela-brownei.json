    "intro": "Cedrela brownei, commonly known as Brazilian\u6843\u82b1\u5fc3\u6728, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by winged fruits that contain one or two seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a significant species in the timber industry. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many regions."
