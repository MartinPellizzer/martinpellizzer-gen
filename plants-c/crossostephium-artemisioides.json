    "intro": "Crossostephium artemisioides, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, sharing structural and chemical similarities with other members of the sagebrush family. Crossostephium artemisioides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
