    "intro": "Ctenophrynium, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its attractive, showy flowers. The plant typically has thick, fleshy leaves and produces small, tubular flowers in shades of violet, pink, and white. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ctenophrynium is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
