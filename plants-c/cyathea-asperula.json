    "intro": "Cyathea asperula, commonly known as the rough hattershag, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its robust, tree-like structure with a thick, fibrous trunk. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough, textured surface. Cyathea asperula thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora."
