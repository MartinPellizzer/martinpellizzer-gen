    "intro": "Chengiodendron minor, commonly known as the Chinese sandthorn, is a small shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, orange-colored fruits that are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrublands and forest edges. Due to its hardiness and ornamental potential, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
