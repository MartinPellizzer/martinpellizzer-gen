    "intro": "Cleome lophosperma, commonly known as the desert spider flower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 2 feet tall, featuring upright stems and hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry conditions, and it is often found in disturbed soils. Cleome lophosperma is adapted to low water availability and thrives in full sun."
