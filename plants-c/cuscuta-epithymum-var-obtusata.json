    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum var. obtusata, commonly known as the bluntleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its host to establish a connection. The plant is native to regions of the United States and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth and health of its host plants."
