    "intro": "Cyphia crenata var. smithiae, commonly known as Smith's cyphia, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of South Africa. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family, characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, while the flowers are often clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
