It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas or along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
