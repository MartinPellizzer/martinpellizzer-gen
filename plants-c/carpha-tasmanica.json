    "intro": "Carpha tasmanica, commonly known as the Tasmanian flat sedge, is a perennial herb native to Tasmania, Australia. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into three-angled, spike-like fruits. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, often forming dense stands that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Carpha tasmanica is an important component of Tasmania's native flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its wetland ecosystems. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal in water gardens and restoration projects."
