    "intro": "Corylopsis glabrescens f. gotoana, commonly known as the Goto's golden flame, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its striking clusters of bright yellow, bell-shaped flowers that appear in late winter to early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth texture and a glossy dark green surface. This variety is noted for its cold hardiness and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its floral display adds early season color to the landscape, enhancing its horticultural value."
