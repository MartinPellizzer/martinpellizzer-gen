It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, fan-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as streams and wetlands. Its fronds are usually less than 10 centimeters in length and have a distinctive, curled appearance. Cyclosorus hewittii is a rare species, often found in specific microhabitats, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
