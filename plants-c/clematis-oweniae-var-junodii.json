    "intro": "Clematis oweniae var. junodii, commonly known as the Junod's Clematis, is a rare and specialized vine native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant prefers well-drained, acidic soils and thrives in partial shade to full sun conditions. Its foliage is usually deep green with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces distinctive, fragrant blooms in shades of blue and purple. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
