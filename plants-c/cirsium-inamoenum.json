    "intro": "Cirsium inamoenum, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, purple to pinkish purple flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower structure. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. The woolly thistle is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and hardy nature."
