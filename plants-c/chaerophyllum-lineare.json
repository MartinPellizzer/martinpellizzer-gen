    "intro": "Chaerophyllum lineare, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hogweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, shady areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its resemblance to toxic species, it is often mistaken for other hogweeds and requires careful identification."
