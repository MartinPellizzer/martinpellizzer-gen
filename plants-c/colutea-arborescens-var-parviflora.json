    "intro": "Colutea arborescens var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its lack of true roots and its specialized haustoria for attachment to host plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is typically found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth and yield of its host plants."
