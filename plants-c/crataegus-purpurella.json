    "intro": "Crataegus purpurella, commonly known as the purple-flowered hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and showy clusters of pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full to partial sunlight."
