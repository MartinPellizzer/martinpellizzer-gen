    "intro": "Ceropegia palustris, commonly known as the marsh ceropegia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms a dense mat of succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often white or pale green, adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
