    "intro": "Ceratozamia morettii, commonly known as the Morettii cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Mexico. It belongs to the cycad family (Cycadaceae) and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
