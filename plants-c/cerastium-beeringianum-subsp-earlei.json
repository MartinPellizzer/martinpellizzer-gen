    "intro": "Cerastium beeringianum subsp. earlei, commonly known as the Arctic mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It produces small, white flowers with five petals, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, contributing to the floral diversity of its alpine ecosystem."
