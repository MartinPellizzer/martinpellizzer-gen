    "intro": "Cadetia legareiensis, commonly known as the Legare Island bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Legare in the Falkland Islands. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and purple. The plant thrives in coastal environments, often found growing in sandy soils along the shoreline. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
