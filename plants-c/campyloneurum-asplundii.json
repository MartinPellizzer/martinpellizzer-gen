    "intro": "Campyloneurum asplundii, commonly known as the Asplund's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces spores in small, cone-like structures called strobili, which are borne on the upper part of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native range."
