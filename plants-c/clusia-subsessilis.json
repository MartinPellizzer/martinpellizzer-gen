    "intro": "Clusia subsessilis, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by orange or red berries. It is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of light conditions. Clusia subsessilis is also valued for its air-purifying properties and its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
