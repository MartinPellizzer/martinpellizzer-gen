    "intro": "Calamagrostis lawrencei, commonly known as Lawrence's reed grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshes. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets that produce small, fluffy seeds. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
