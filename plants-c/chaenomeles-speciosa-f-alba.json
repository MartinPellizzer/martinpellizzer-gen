    "intro": "Chaenomeles speciosa f. alba, commonly known as the white form of Japanese flowering quince, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, yellow, edible fruits in late summer, though they are typically not consumed by humans. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant floral display and attractive bark. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
