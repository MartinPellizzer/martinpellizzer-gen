    "intro": "Cardamine \u00d7 keckii, commonly known as the Keck's watercress, is a hybrid plant in the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae). It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which are borne on slender stems. It is native to parts of North America and is often found in wetlands, streams, and other freshwater habitats. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its parent species."
