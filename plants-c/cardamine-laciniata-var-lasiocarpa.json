    "intro": "Cardamine laciniata var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the hairy water-crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of short, soft hairs. Its small, white flowers are clustered in a head and bloom in early spring. The species is characterized by its preference for calcareous soils and its role in supporting aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
