    "intro": "Cestrum triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered cestrum, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshade plants, and is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters, with smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale yellow, emit a strong, sweet scent, especially at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Cestrum triflorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
