    "intro": "Catasetum pleidactylon, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow and orange flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are often covered in a dense, white mycorrhizal coating, which aids in nutrient absorption. Catasetum pleidactylon is also notable for its unique pollination mechanism, involving specialized structures that facilitate the transfer of pollen to specific pollinators."
