    "intro": "Citrullus edulis, commonly known as watermelon, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family and is native to Africa. It is a vigorous, annual vine that produces large, lobed leaves and bright green, hairy stems. The plant's most distinctive feature is its large, fleshy, red or yellow fruit, which contains numerous seeds and a high water content. The fruit is typically cultivated for its sweet, juicy flesh, which is rich in vitamins A and C. Botanically, watermelon is characterized by its monoecious nature, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant."
