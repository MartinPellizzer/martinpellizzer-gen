    "intro": "Coniogramme japonica var. fauriei, commonly known as the Japanese fern or Faurie's coniogramme, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. The spores are borne on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
