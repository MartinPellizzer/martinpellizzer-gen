It is characterized by its strikingly varied leaf colors, ranging from green to red, purple, and even white, which make it visually distinctive. The plant is a climbing legume with trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for both ornamental and nutritional purposes. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil makes it a beneficial plant in agricultural systems."
