It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is known for its vigorous growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Its botanical features make it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural environments."
