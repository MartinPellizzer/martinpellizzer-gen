    "intro": "Calamagrostis kokonorica, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the high altitudes of Tibet and adjacent regions. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces delicate, feathery plumes that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its foliage is typically green, with silver-gray tones on the underside, adding visual interest. Calamagrostis kokonorica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in arid and semi-arid environments."
