    "intro": "Cyathea arbuscula, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, trunk-like stem covered in persistent, overlapping fronds. The plant has a rhizome that supports its growth and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Cyathea arbuscula is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
