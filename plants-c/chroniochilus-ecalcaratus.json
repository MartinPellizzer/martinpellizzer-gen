    "intro": "Chroniochilus ecalcaratus, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like appendages on the base of its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its natural range."
