    "intro": "Colocasia dibangensis, commonly known as the Dibang arrowleaf, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of northeastern India and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive umbrella-like inflorescence called a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 60 cm in diameter, often with a dark green color and a waxy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical climates. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
