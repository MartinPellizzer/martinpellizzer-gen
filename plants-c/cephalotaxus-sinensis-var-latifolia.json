    "intro": "Cephalotaxus sinensis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to China. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for shaded garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and unique, branching form."
