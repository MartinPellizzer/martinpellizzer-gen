    "intro": "Corydalis rutifolia subsp. uniflora, commonly known as the slender corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it produces clusters of small, pinkish to purple flowers. Its flowers are usually arranged in umbels and bloom in early spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its single-flowered umbels, which set it apart from other members of the Corydalis genus."
