    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lanceolate, meaning they are narrow and pointed, distinguishing it from the typical round leaves of the species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
