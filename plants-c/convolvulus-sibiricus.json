    "intro": "Convolvulus sibiricus, commonly known as Siberian morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It is a trailing or climbing annual herb with distinctive heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its invasive potential in certain regions."
