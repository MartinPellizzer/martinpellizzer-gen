    "intro": "Combretum platyphyllum, commonly known as the flat-leaf combretum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often glabrous. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
