    "intro": "Cerasus serrulata f. alboplena, commonly known as the white-flowered dwarf cherry, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly serrated. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are highly ornamental and attract pollinators. Its fruit, a small cherry, is edible but less commonly cultivated for consumption. This variety is prized in horticulture for its aesthetic value and hardy nature."
