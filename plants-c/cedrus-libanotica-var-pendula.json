    "intro": "Cedrus libanotica var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cedar of Lebanon, is a distinctive cultivar of the cedar tree characterized by its cascading, drooping branches. It features a conical shape with long, pendulous shoots that give it a unique, ornamental appearance. The tree produces small, scale-like leaves that are blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast. Its cones are typically reddish-brown and contain edible, winged seeds. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is well-suited to temperate climates."
