    "intro": "Cerastium gibraltaricum var. lanatum, commonly known as the Gibraltar hairy mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky habitats of Gibraltar. It features small, hairy, rounded leaves and produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to the harsh, sunny conditions of its coastal environment. Its hairy foliage helps reduce water loss and protect against strong winds. It is an important component of the local flora and is often found in limestone crevices and coastal cliffs."
