    "intro": "Cienfuegosia sulfurea var. major, commonly known as the golden cienfuegosia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange inflorescences, which are composed of numerous small, tubular flowers arranged in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
