    "intro": "Cystopus flavescens, commonly known as the yellow bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its branched, root-like structures called rhizophores, which help anchor it in water and absorb nutrients. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. It is often found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Cystopus flavescens is a carnivorous plant, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic invertebrates to supplement its nutrient intake."
