    "intro": "Combretum argyrophyllum, commonly known as silverleaf combretum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, reflective hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in natural habitats. The plant is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in savanna and woodland environments."
