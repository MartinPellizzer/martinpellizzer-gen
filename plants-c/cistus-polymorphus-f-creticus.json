It features aromatic, glandular leaves and produces striking pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. It is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
