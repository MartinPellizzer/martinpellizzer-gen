    "intro": "Cervantesia, commonly known as the \"Cervantes' grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Cervantesia species are often found in rocky soils and can tolerate drought conditions. They play a minor role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and forage for small animals and insects."
