    "intro": "Cyclostemon gilgianus, commonly known as the Gilgian cycad, is a unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a tropical or subtropical climate to flourish. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
