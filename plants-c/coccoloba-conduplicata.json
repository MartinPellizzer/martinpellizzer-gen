    "intro": "Coccoloba conduplicata, commonly known as the double-leaf coccoloba, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its palmately divided leaves, which are often deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, smooth, blue-black berries that are edible. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage."
