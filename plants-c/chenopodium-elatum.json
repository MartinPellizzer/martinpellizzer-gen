    "intro": "Chenopodium elatum, commonly known as lambsquarters, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by dry, three-angled seeds. Lambsquarters is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in agricultural fields. It is a common weed but also serves as a food source for various insects and birds."
