    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha var. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is widely cultivated in temperate regions."
