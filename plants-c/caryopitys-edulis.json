    "intro": "Caryopitys edulis, commonly known as the edible fern, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are covered in small, spore-producing structures called sporangia. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines for their mild, slightly sweet flavor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Caryopitys edulis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
