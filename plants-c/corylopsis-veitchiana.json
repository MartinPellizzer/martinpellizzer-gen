It features small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for early spring gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and compact growth habit."
