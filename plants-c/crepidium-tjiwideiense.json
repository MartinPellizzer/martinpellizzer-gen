    "intro": "Crepidium tjiwideiense, commonly known as the Tjiwidei orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically features slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, with blooms that are often pale green or white in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
