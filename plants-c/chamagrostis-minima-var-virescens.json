    "intro": "Chamagrostis minima var. virescens, commonly known as the greenstem sedge, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in moist to wet environments. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, forming compact clumps that are often found in wet meadows or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are usually a vibrant green, which gives it its common name. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
