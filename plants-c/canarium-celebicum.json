It is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by green, fleshy fruits. The fruit contains a hard, aromatic seed known as the nutmeg, which is widely used as a spice. Canarium celebicum plays a significant role in both local ecosystems and global spice trade."
