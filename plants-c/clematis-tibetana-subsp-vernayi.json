The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a finely toothed margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
