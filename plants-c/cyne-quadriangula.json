    "intro": "Cyne quadriangula, commonly known as the four-angled nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive quadrangular stems. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges and are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Cyne quadriangula is known for its stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact with the skin."
