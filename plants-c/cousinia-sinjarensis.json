    "intro": "Cousinia sinjarensis, commonly known as the Sinjar cushion plant, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Iraq and Syria. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushion-like structure composed of tightly packed rosettes of foliage. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in rocky and well-drained soils. Cousinia sinjarensis is notable for its resilience to harsh climatic conditions and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
