    "intro": "Citropsis gabunensis var. lacourtiana, commonly known as the Gabonian citrus tree, is a rare and little-known species native to Central Africa. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen, broad-leaved structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by citrus-like fruits. Its botanical significance lies in its potential ecological role and possible medicinal properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
