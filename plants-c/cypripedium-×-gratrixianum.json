    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 gratrixianum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium micranthum. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia, characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and produces leaves that are usually lanceolate or ovate in shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
