    "intro": "Castilleja lassenensis, commonly known as Lassen's Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the high elevations of California. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, tubular flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its root system to absorb nutrients from neighboring host plants. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Castilleja lassenensis is an important component of alpine ecosystems and is often found in association with other native flora in the Sierra Nevada region."
