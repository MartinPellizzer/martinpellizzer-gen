    "intro": "Cereus grandis, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. The flowers are short-lived, often closing by dawn, and the plant is popular in horticulture for its dramatic nighttime display."
