    "intro": "Carex vesicaria var. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed burr sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically brown or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
