    "intro": "Cryophytum framesii, commonly known as the Antarctic hair-crisp, is a unique plant adapted to extreme cold environments. It is native to the cold regions of Antarctica and surrounding islands. The plant exhibits a rosette growth form, with dense, hairy leaves that help insulate it from freezing temperatures. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of fine, white hairs that reduce water loss and protect against UV radiation. Cryophytum framesii is a rare and specialized species, representing one of the few flowering plants that can survive in such harsh, polar conditions."
