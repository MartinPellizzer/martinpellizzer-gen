    "intro": "Croton subcinerellus var. aquidabanensis, commonly known as the Aquidaban croton, is a shrub native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to reddish hues. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicle inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland to montane forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
