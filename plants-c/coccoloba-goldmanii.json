    "intro": "Coccoloba goldmanii, commonly known as the golden coccoloba, is a species of shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Lesser Antilles. It is characterized by its striking, lobed leaves that often display a vibrant yellow or golden hue, especially during the dry season. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and on rocky outcrops, adapting to saline and well-drained soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white, and it produces berries that range in color from red to black. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
