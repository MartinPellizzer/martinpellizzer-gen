    "intro": "Centaurea resupinata f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf cornflower, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its compact stature and vibrant blue to purple flowers. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with prominent central cones, which are surrounded by ray florets. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
