    "intro": "Cnicus monocephalus, commonly known as the single-headed cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are generally basal, rough, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Cnicus monocephalus is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
