    "intro": "Carduus tmoleus subsp. cronius, commonly known as the Cronius thistle, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and large, pale green to greyish leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and wastelands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
