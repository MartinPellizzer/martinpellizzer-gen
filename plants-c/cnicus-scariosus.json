    "intro": "Cnicus scariosus, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy, often silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to stabilize sandy soils, making it a common pioneer species in disturbed environments. Cnicus scariosus is also known for its medicinal properties, with historical use in treating skin conditions and respiratory ailments."
