It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or wildflower meadows. Its botanical characteristics make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in natural habitats."
