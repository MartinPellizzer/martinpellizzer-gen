    "intro": "Croton capitatus var. albinoides, commonly known as the white-flowered croton, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage and unique floral display. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range from yellow to orange, often contrasting with its broad, glossy leaves. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to add visual interest to gardens or indoor spaces. However, it should be handled with care, as its sap can cause skin irritation."
