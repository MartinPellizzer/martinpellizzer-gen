    "intro": "Cynoglossum nigrum, commonly known as black hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
