    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris var. vera, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features alternate, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces spherical, three-lobed seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed but also a valuable plant for ecological studies."
