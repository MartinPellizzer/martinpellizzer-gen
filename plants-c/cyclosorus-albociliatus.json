    "intro": "Cyclosorus albociliatus, commonly known as the white-ciliated liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbon-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white cilia, giving it its common name. This species typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are simple and consist of a capsule that releases spores. Cyclosorus albociliatus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
