    "intro": "Crotalaria kassneri, commonly known as the yellow crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and palmate leaves. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Crotalaria kassneri is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
