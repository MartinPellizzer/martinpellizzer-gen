It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and bright yellow flowers with a distinctive white center. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, and the flowers bloom from late spring to early summer. Centaurea leucolepis is an important plant for pollinators and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
