    "intro": "Caragana frutescens var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf bush clover, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. This species is often used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
