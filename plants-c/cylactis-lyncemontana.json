    "intro": "Cylactis lyncemontana, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves covered in a fine silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, which bloom in the evening. Its fruit is a fleshy, yellowish berry that ripens in late summer. The plant contains toxic alkaloids and is often avoided by both animals and humans."
