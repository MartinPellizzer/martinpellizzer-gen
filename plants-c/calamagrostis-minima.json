    "intro": "Calamagrostis minima, commonly known as the dwarf reed or narrowleaf reed, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, grass-like leaves that are often silver-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, releasing light green to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along streams.
