    "intro": "Columnea tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its velvety, hairy foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or a trailing vine, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including hummingbirds and bees, due to their nectar-rich structure. Columnea tomentosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, moist conditions."
