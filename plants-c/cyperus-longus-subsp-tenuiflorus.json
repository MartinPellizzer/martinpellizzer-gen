    "intro": "Cyperus longus subsp. tenuiflorus, commonly known as slenderflower flatsedge, is a grass-like plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as wetlands and seasonally flooded areas. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils across tropical and subtropical regions."
