    "intro": "Convallaria trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaved lily, is a species of flowering plant in the family Convallariaceae. It is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a key identifying feature. The plant contains cardiac glycosides, making it toxic to humans and animals."
