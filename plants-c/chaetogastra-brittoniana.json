It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheats and knotweeds. The plant is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
