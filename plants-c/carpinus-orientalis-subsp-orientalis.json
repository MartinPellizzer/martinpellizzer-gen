    "intro": "Carpinus orientalis subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the Oriental hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, dark bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by small, round nuts enclosed in a prickly husk. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
