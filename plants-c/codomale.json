    "intro": "Codomale, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, velvety petals. The plant typically features rosettes of dark green, waxy leaves and produces clusters of flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. Codomale thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
