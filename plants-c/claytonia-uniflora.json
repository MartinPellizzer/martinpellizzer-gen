    "intro": "Claytonia uniflora, commonly known as the pink rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are rounded and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, showy pink or white flower at the end of each stem, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
