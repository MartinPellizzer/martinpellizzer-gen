    "intro": "Craniospermum tuvinicum, commonly known as the Tuvinian skullplant, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Siberia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by fluffy, seed-filled structures that aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Craniospermum tuvinicum is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
