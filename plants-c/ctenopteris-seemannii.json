    "intro": "Ctenopteris seemannii, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that helps it anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil. Its fronds are divided into segments called pinnae, which are arranged in a distinctive, cascading pattern. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
