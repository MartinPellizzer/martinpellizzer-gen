    "intro": "Comesperma aphyllum, commonly known as the leafless mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to eastern Australia. It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its stems for photosynthesis, which are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant attaches to its host tree, typically a eucalypt, through a specialized structure called a haustellum, which penetrates the host's vascular system. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, Comesperma aphyllum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
