    "intro": "Cotyledon malacophylla, commonly known as the wrinkled cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are characterized by their unique, wrinkled texture and deep green color. Cotyledon malacophylla is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
