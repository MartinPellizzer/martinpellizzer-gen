    "intro": "Cynodon dactylon var. stellatus, commonly known as the stellate Bermuda grass, is a variant of the widely distributed Bermuda grass species. It is characterized by its distinctive stellate (star-shaped) inflorescences, which give it a unique appearance compared to the typical grasses. This plant is a perennial grass that thrives in warm climates and is often found in lawns, sports fields, and disturbed soils. It has a dense, creeping growth habit with short, rhizomatous stems that help it spread rapidly. Its botanical features make it both a valuable turfgrass and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
