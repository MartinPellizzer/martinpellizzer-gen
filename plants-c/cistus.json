    "intro": "Cistus, commonly known as rockrose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cupressaceae, comprising around 30 species. These shrubs are native to the Mediterranean region and are characterized by their aromatic evergreen leaves and showy, pink or white flowers. They thrive in rocky, well-drained soils and are adapted to dry, sunny conditions. The plant's resinous sap has been historically used in perfumery and traditional medicine. Cistus species are also valued for their ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
