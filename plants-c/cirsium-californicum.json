    "intro": "Cirsium californicum, commonly known as the California thistle, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and showy purple or pink flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The California thistle plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in coastal and inland regions of California."
