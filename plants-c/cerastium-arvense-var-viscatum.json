    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. viscatum, commonly known as sticky mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate habit and dense clusters of small, white flowers. The leaves are hairy and often covered with a sticky substance, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
