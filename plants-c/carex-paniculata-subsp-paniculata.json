    "intro": "Carex paniculata subsp. paniculata, commonly known as the panicled sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces upright, branched inflorescences with small, greenish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. It is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in waterlogged areas."
