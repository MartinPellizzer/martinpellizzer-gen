    "intro": "Chondrilla repens, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with fleshy, cylindrical stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Chondrilla repens is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats."
