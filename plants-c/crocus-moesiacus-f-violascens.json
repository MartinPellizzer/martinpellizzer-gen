It features striking violet to deep purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically between February and April. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spherical bulbs that help it propagate. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and vivid coloration."
