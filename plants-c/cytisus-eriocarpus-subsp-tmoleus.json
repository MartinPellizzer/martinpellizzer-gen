    "intro": "Cytisus eriocarpus subsp. tmoleus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are narrow and leathery, with a distinctive silver or grayish underside. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rocky or coastal areas. This subspecies is closely related to other cytisus species but is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and geographic distribution."
