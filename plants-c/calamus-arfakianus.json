    "intro": "Calamus arfakianus, commonly known as the Arfak cane, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to the island of New Guinea and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that are used for making handicrafts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by bright red berries. Calamus arfakianus thrives in wet, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary economic value lies in its fibrous stalks."
