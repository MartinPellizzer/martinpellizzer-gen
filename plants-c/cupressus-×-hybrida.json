    "intro": "Cupressus \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the Port Orford cedar, is a hybrid coniferous tree resulting from the cross between Cupressus macrocarpa and Cupressus arizonica. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves and a pyramidal or conical shape, often with a smooth, bluish-gray bark. This plant is native to the western coast of the United States and is adapted to coastal climates with high humidity and salt spray. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. The tree produces small, rounded cones and is valued for its resistance to certain pests and diseases."
