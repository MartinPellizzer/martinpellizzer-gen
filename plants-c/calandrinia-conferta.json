    "intro": "Calandrinia conferta, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant pink or purple flowers that open in the morning and close by midday, adapting to the heat of the day. Its botanical features include hairy stems, small alternate leaves, and capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Calandrinia conferta is often found in disturbed soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
