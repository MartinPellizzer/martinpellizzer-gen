    "intro": "Craspedosorus sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in humid climates. The plant has a dense, carpet-like growth habit with small, overlapping leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. Its structure consists of a thallus with distinct leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are arranged in a rosette pattern. Craspedosorus sinensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
