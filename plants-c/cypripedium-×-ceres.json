    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 ceres, commonly known as the Chinese lily or the yellow lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green petals, which resemble a slipper or a lady's shoe, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments and is known for its delicate, fragrant flowers. It has a long, slender stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height, supporting a single, showy bloom. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and protected areas."
