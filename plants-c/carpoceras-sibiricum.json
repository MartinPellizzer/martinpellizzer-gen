    "intro": "Carpoceras sibiricum, commonly known as the Siberian liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with distinct lobes and is characterized by its ability to retain water, which is essential for its survival in humid climates. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, undifferentiated body called a thallus. Carpoceras sibiricum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native range."
