    "intro": "Chrysopogon muricatus, commonly known as the hairy grass or mouse-tail grass, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, demonstrating a degree of drought tolerance. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like structure bearing small, spikelet-based flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. Chrysopogon muricatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in some traditional practices, though its ecological role is still being studied."
