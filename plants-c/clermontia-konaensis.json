    "intro": "Clermontia konaensis, commonly known as Kona mistflower, is an endemic plant species native to the island of Hawaii. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, tubular flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of rainforests, often near streams or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Clermontia konaensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
