    "intro": "Cupamenis, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow fronds that resemble small cups. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizome is creeping and produces multiple shoots, allowing it to spread gradually. The fronds are pinnately divided with a serrated margin, adding to its ornamental value."
