    "intro": "Cylindropuntia alcahes var. mcgillii, commonly known as the McGill's cholla, is a spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features cylindrical, segmented stems that are typically green and covered with small, hair-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sunlight. Its structure and growth habits make it well adapted to desert conditions."
