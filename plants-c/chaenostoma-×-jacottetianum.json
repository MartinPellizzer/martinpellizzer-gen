    "intro": "Chaenostoma \u00d7 jacottetianum, commonly known as the hybrid water lily, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Chaenostoma acutangulum and Chaenostoma palustre. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, adapted for life in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in muddy substrates while absorbing nutrients from the water. This hybrid is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystem dynamics."
