    "intro": "Campanula malyi, commonly known as the Malyi bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
