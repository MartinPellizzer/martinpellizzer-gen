    "intro": "Citrus polyandra, commonly known as the star-shaped citrus or the lemon tree of the tropics, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, waxy leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces oval, green fruits that turn yellow when ripe, containing a segmented, juicy pulp with a tart, acidic flavor. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Due to its adaptability, it is often cultivated in warm, humid climates for both its beauty and its fruit."
