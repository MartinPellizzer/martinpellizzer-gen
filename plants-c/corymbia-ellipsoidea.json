    "intro": "Corymbia ellipsoidea, commonly known as the narrow-leafed apple or the red gum, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry inland regions. Corymbia ellipsoidea is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
