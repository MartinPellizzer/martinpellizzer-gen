It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, hairy stipules. The plant produces bright yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are often used in traditional medicine. Cassia verrucosa thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks."
