    "intro": "Calceolaria crenatiflora, commonly known as the wavy-flowered calceolaria, is a perennial herb native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-edged leaves and striking, slipper-shaped flowers that range in color from violet to red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Calceolaria crenatiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
