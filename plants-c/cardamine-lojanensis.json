    "intro": "Cardamine lojanensis, commonly known as the Lojan mountain buttercup, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy, often toxic species. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as rocky slopes and forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
