    "intro": "Crepidium macrochilum, commonly known as the large-lipped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, with petals and sepals that are often marked with purple or brown streaks. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. The orchid is noted for its unique morphology and is a popular subject in botanical studies due to its ecological and horticultural significance."
