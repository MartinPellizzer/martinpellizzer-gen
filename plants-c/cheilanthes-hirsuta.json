    "intro": "Cheilanthes hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy rock fern, is a perennial fern species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and hairy, dark green fronds that are often covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent-like leaves. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. Cheilanthes hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize rocky habitats with minimal water requirements."
