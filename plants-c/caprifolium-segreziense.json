    "intro": "Caprifolium segreziense, commonly known as the Segreziense honeysuckle, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive tubular shape that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
