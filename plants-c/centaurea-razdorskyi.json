It is a perennial herb with upright, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers in compact, conical clusters, which bloom in summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or steppe habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
