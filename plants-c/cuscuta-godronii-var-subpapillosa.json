    "intro": "Cuscuta godronii var. subpapillosa, commonly known as the silky dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like structure that allows it to attach to various host plants. The plant is characterized by its finely hairy stems and is often found in dry, disturbed habitats. It is native to regions of North America and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
