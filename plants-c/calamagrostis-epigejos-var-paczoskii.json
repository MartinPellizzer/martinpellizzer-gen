    "intro": "Calamagrostis epigejos var. paczoskii, commonly known as the Pacific silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and tall, slender culms that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces fluffy, feathery seed heads in late summer, which are a striking feature of its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. This variety is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, attractive clumps."
