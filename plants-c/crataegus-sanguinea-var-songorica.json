It is characterized by its thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces white to pink flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
