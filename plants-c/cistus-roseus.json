    "intro": "Cistus roseus, commonly known as the rosemary bush or Portuguese rose, is a flowering shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic evergreen leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, are widely used in aromatherapy and as a natural insect repellent."
