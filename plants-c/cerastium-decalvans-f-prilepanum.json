    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans f. prilepanum, commonly known as the Prilepanum sand everlasting, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the steppes of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense cluster of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the arid and windy conditions of its habitat. This subspecies is particularly notable for its ability to thrive in sandy soils and its resilience to harsh environmental conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
