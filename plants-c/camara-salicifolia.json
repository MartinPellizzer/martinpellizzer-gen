    "intro": "Camara salicifolia, commonly known as the willowleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other notable plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of willow trees, hence its common name. Its flowers are typically purple or violet, with five petals, and it produces small, toxic berries. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in gardens and is considered a weed in some regions."
