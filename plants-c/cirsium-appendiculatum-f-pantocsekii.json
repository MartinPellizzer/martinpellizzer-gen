    "intro": "Cirsium appendiculatum f. pantocsekii, commonly known as the Hungarian thistle, is a rare botanical variant of the common thistle. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny foliage and purple-pink flower heads that bloom in late summer. This subspecies is native to Hungary and parts of Central Europe, where it thrives in dry, open habitats. The plant's morphology includes a robust stem with glandular hairs and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique genetic traits."
