    "intro": "Cardamine bellidifolia var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the pinnatifid watercress, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fern-like, pinnately divided leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its seeds are dispersed by water, contributing to its spread in wetland habitats."
