It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in suitable habitats."
