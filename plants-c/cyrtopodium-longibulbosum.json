    "intro": "Cyrtopodium longibulbosum, commonly known as the long-bulb orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in seasonal environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall ornamental appeal. Cyrtopodium longibulbosum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
