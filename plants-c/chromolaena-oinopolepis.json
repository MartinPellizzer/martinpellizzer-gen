    "intro": "Chromolaena oinopolepis, commonly known as the spreading crownflower, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and clearings. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a problematic weed in many regions outside its native range."
