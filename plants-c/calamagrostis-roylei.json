    "intro": "Calamagrostis roylei, commonly known as the Kashmir grass, is a perennial grass native to the Himalayan regions of India and Pakistan. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, typically in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Calamagrostis roylei is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
