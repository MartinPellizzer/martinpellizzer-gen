    "intro": "Cercidium, commonly known as the honey mesquite, is a genus of shrubs and small trees native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. These plants are characterized by their compound leaves, which are often divided into small, hairless leaflets. The flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, appearing in clusters and attracting various pollinators. Cercidium species are adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow them to access water from deep underground. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
