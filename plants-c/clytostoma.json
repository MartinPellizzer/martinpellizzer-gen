    "intro": "Clytostoma, commonly known as the violet orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to various regions in Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Clytostoma species are typically epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on trees or rocks rather than in soil. They produce showy, fragrant flowers that are often violet or purple in color. The genus is characterized by its unique floral structure and is valued for its ornamental beauty in horticulture."
