It is characterized by its large, orbicular to ovate leaves that are typically bright green and sometimes variegated. The plant produces showy, orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its striking foliage and vibrant inflorescences."
