    "intro": "Cheirostylis josephi, commonly known as the Joseph's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its pale green, lance-shaped leaves and its unique, elongated floral structure that resembles a ghostly figure. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within montane forests, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are pale green to white with a subtle fragrance. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Cheirostylis josephi is considered critically endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
