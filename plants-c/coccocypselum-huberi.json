    "intro": "Coccocypselum huberi, commonly known as the desert cactus or the white-flowered cactus, is a species native to arid regions of South America. It is a small, spiny shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and dry habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and protect it from herbivores. The plant's root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers in its harsh environment."
