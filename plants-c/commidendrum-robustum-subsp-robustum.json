It is a tall, slender palm with a single, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by black, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and riverine forests.
