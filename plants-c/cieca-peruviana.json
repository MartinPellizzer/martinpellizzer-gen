    "intro": "Cieca peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian cieca, is a unique plant native to the Andean regions of Peru. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage that forms a water-holding cup. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy surface, which helps in retaining moisture in its arid habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden within the leaf rosette. Cieca peruviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
