    "intro": "Carex loheri, commonly known as the Loher's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and a dense cluster of spikelets at the top. Native to specific regions of North America, particularly in the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
