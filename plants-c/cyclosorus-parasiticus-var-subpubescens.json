    "intro": "Cyclosorus parasiticus var. subpubescens, commonly known as the hairy cyclosorus, is a parasitic plant that primarily attaches itself to the roots of other plants for nourishment. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many familiar plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and a lack of true roots, relying instead on specialized structures called haustoria to extract nutrients from its host. Its growth is typically limited to shaded, moist environments where it can find suitable host plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in forest ecosystems by influencing the health and distribution of its host species."
