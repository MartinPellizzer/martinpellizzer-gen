    "intro": "Cabralea schwackei, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or cabralea. It is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, red berries. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens. Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
