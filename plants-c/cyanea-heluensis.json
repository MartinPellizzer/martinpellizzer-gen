    "intro": "Cyanea heluensis, commonly known as the Hilo cyanea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are slender and covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, Cyanea heluensis is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts."
