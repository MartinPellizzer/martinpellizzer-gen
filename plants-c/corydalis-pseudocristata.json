    "intro": "Corydalis pseudocristata, commonly known as the false crown vetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, delicate flowers. The plant produces distinctive spurred petals and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it adapts to cold and harsh environmental conditions. Corydalis pseudocristata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its spring blooms."
