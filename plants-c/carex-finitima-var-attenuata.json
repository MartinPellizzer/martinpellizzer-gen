It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and the edges of ponds. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas. The plant is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
