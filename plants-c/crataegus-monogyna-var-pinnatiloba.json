    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. pinnatiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, pinnately lobed leaves that give it its varietal name. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in spring, followed by red or orange berries in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
