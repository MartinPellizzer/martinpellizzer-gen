It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its dense, thorny branches. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly waxy texture. Cordia mucronata is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in savannas and rocky areas."
