It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Castelnavia pusillina is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
