    "intro": "Cyperus lacustris, commonly known as the water papyrus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in wetland habitats. Cyperus lacustris plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and stabilizing shoreline soils."
