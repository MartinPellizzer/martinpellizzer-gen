    "intro": "Carex stellulata var. cephalantha, commonly known as the sky-blue sweetgrass, is a perennial sedge native to the eastern United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically a striking blue-green color, which becomes more intense in full sun. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale blue to white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
