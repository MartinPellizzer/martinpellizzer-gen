    "intro": "Cytisus scoparius var. reverchonii, commonly known as the Reverchon's broom, is a flowering shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are small, oval, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
