It is characterized by its slender, silver-tipped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and swamps. Its flowering spikes are usually pale green to yellowish, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Calamagrostis lucida is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability."
