    "intro": "Ceropegia sharpei subsp. repens, commonly known as the creeping African violet, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features tuberous roots and produces fleshy, trailing stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread easily. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. Its flowers are showy, with a distinctive hooded structure and a violet or pinkish hue. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot."
