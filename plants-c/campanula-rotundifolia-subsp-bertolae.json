    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia subsp. bertolae, commonly known as the round-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, velvety leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in woodland or alpine habitats. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and flower structure compared to the typical form of Campanula rotundifolia."
