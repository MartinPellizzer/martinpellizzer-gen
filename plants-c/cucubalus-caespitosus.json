    "intro": "Cucubalus caespitosus, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features a rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, similar to dandelions, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine. Cucubalus caespitosus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in arid environments."
