It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, white to yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, oval berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
