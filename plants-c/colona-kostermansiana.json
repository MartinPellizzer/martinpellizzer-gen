It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves.

It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
