    "intro": "Cassia magnifica, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow inflorescences that appear in clusters, giving it a fiery appearance. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into many small leaflets, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Cassia magnifica thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
