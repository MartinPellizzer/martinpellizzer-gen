    "intro": "Callichloe, commonly known as coastal grass or sea grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or saline soils. Callichloe species are characterized by their narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. They play an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines. Due to their adaptability to harsh coastal conditions, they are often used in ecological restoration projects."
