    "intro": "Cyperus sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim flatsedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is native to the Himalayan region, particularly found in Nepal, India, and Bhutan. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its slender, grass-like leaves are arranged in a dense rosette, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. Cyperus sikkimensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
