    "intro": "Chrysanthemum gmelinii, commonly known as the Siberian chrysanthemum, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions and tundra-like habitats. Chrysanthemum gmelinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
