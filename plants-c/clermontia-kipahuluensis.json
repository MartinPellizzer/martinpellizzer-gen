    "intro": "Clermontia kipahuluensis, commonly known as the Kipahulu clermonthe, is a rare endemic species found exclusively in the rainforests of Hawaii's Maui Island. This flowering plant belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom during the winter months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing in the understory of native Hawaiian forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Clermontia kipahuluensis is considered critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
