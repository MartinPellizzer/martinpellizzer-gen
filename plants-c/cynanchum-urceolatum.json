    "intro": "Cynanchum urceolatum, commonly known as the bell-shaped milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, bell-like white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can be harmful to animals and humans. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Cynanchum urceolatum plays a role in supporting local wildlife, though its toxicity limits its use in horticulture."
