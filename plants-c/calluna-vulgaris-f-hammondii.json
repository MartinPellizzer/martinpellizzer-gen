    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris f. hammondii, commonly known as the Hammond's heather, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the British Isles. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
