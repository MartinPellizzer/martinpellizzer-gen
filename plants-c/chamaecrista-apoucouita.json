    "intro": "Chamaecrista apoucouita, commonly known as the Brazilian burr legume, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes and bean plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed or open habitats. It produces small, yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The seeds are enclosed in hard, woody pods, which contribute to its common name due to their rough, bristly appearance."
