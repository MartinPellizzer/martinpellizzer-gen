    "intro": "Craterispermum deblockianum, commonly known as the Dombey's rock cress, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
