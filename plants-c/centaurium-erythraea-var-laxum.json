    "intro": "Centaurium erythraea var. laxum, commonly known as the slender centaury, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters and features slender, erect stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bright red flowers that are clustered in umbel-like inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This variety is characterized by its more lax growth habit compared to the typical form of Centaurium erythraea."
