It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into three to five narrow lobes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Cyclosorus acutilobus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
