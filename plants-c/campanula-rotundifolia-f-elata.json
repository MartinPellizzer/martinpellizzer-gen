    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia f. elata, commonly known as the tall bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are round or oval, with a hairy surface, and the stems are often tinged with red or purple. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often grown in gardens for its vibrant flowers and adaptability to various soil conditions. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
