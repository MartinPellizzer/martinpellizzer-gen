    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris parallela, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It features small, white or pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, round, nut-like seeds enclosed in a cup-like structure called a silique. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. This species is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in gardens, where it thrives in moist, temperate conditions."
