It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, meadows, and along riverbanks. The plant features showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are erect and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Crepinia \u00d7 dumetorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
