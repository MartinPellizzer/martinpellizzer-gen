    "intro": "Corrigiola litoralis subsp. foliosa, commonly known as the sea lentil, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. This subspecies thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically pink or white and bloom in late summer. The plant is widely used in traditional medicine and is also a popular ornamental species in coastal gardens."
