    "intro": "Corymbia ferriticola subsp. sitiens, commonly known as the Sitien red gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the northern regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and slightly hairy on the underside, adapting to the arid conditions of its habitat. It produces small, clustered white flowers during the winter months, which are followed by edible, woody capsules containing seeds. This subspecies is well-suited to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas with low rainfall."
