    "intro": "Cyathea boryana, commonly known as the Bory's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea boryana is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
