    "intro": "Combretum obtusifolium, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in summer. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and floral display."
