It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy blooms. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments.

Coreopsis mexicana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
