These plants are native to tropical regions of the Americas, Africa, and Southeast Asia, and they are characterized by their tall, often branched stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Costus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking foliage and unique floral structures. Some species are also used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
