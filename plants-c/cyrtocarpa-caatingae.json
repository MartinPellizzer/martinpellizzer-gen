    "intro": "Cyrtocarpa caatingae, commonly known as the caatinga fig, is a shrub native to the semi-arid regions of northeastern Brazil. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and edible fruits. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its fruits are small, round, and turn from green to yellow or red when mature, providing food for various wildlife species. Cyrtocarpa caatingae plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
