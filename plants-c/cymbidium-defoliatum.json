    "intro": "Cymbidium defoliatum, commonly known as the leafless orchid, is a rare and unique species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with its photosynthetic function carried out by its fleshy, modified stems. The plant produces striking, long-lasting orchid flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
