It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as bloom. The plant is native to North America and thrives in disturbed soils, such as those found in roadsides and fields. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. The species is also known for its edible leaves, which have a slightly tangy flavor and are used in various traditional cuisines."
