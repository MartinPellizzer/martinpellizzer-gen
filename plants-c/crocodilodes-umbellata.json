    "intro": "Crocodilodes umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble an umbrella. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is native to regions with high humidity and warm climates. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome from which the fronds emerge in a clustered arrangement. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique adaptation makes it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
