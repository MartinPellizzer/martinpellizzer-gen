    "intro": "Campium viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous campion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain live seeds, a trait known as viviparity, which is rare in the plant kingdom. Its leaves are alternate and oval-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Campium viviparum thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
