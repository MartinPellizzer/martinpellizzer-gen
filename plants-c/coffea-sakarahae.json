    "intro": "Coffea sakarahae, commonly known as the Sakara Hill coffee. It is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Madagascar. This plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, red flowers that bloom during the dry season. The berries, which are typically red when mature, contain two seeds used for coffee production. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coffea sakarahae is considered a critically endangered species."
