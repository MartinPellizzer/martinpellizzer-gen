    "intro": "Clematis grossa, commonly known as the common clematis, is a deciduous vine native to Europe and western Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces showy, usually white or blue flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and can climb supports with its strong, twisting stems. Clematis grossa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
