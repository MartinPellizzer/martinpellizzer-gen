    "intro": "Carduus steudneri, commonly known as Steudner's thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, typically growing in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features a tall, spiny stem with large, lobed leaves and is characterized by its purple to pink composite flower heads. It produces small, achene seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in arid and semi-arid environments."
