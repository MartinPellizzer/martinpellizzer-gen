    "intro": "Chrysophyllum miragoaneum, commonly known as the Miragoane cherry, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to cherries, with a sweet, tangy flavor. It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species in its native habitat."
