It is characterized by its fragrant, narrow leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue berries. The plant is valued for its aromatic bark, which is used in traditional medicine and as a spice. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
