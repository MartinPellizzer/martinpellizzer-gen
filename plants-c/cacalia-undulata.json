    "intro": "Cacalia undulata, commonly known as the wavy cacalia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, coastal habitats. Cacalia undulata is an important plant for local pollinators and is considered a rare species due to its limited distribution."
