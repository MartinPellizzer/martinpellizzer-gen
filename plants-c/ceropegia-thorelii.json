    "intro": "Ceropegia thorelii, commonly known as the string of hearts, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a unique structure that attracts specific pollinators. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ceropegia thorelii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
