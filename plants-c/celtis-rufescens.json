    "intro": "Celtis rufescens, commonly known as the red osier hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Elm family (Ulmaceae) and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and oval-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, fuzzy fruits that ripen in the fall. Its leaves turn yellow in autumn, adding seasonal interest to the landscape. Celtis rufescens is often used in urban landscapes due to its tolerance of various soil types and resistance to pests and diseases."
