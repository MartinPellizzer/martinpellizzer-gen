    "intro": "Convolvulus umbellatus var. glabriusculus, commonly known as the smoothleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in the morning, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variant is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to other varieties of Convolvulus umbellatus."
