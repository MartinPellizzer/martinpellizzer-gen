It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feather-like fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments. Cyathea praetermissa plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
