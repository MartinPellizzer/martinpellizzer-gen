    "intro": "Cytisus arboreus var. macranthus, commonly known as the large-flowered broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, woody stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
