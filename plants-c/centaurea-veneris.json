    "intro": "Centaurea veneris, commonly known as the Venus's Looking-glass, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bright red flowers that are often surrounded by white bracts, creating a visually striking appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it produces small, cylindrical seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. Centaurea veneris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden settings."
