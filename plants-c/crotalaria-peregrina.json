    "intro": "Crotalaria peregrina, commonly known as the wandering crotalaria, is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant features showy yellow flowers with distinctive veined petals, and it produces small, spiny pods that contain toxic seeds. Crotalaria peregrina is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid environments due to its drought tolerance. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to livestock."
