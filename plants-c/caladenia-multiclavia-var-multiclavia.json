    "intro": "Caladenia multiclavia var. multiclavia, commonly known as the multiclava spider orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to southeastern Australia. This terrestrial herb features a slender, wiry stem with a single or few flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color. The flowers have a distinctive, elongated labellum and are often adorned with intricate patterns that aid in pollination. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats, often in areas with full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
