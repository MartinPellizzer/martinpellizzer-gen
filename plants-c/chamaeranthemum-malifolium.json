    "intro": "Chamaeranthemum malifolium, commonly known as the sweet potato vine, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. While it is not related to true sweet potatoes, its common name reflects its historical use in traditional medicine."
