    "intro": "Crataegus radiosa, commonly known as the radiant hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. The radiant hawthorn is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits to pollinators."
