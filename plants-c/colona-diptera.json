    "intro": "Colona diptera, commonly known as the common green bottle fly, is a species of fly belonging to the family Calliphoridae. It is characterized by its metallic green body and distinctive eye structure. The plant is not a botanical entity but an animal, specifically an insect, so it does not have botanical aspects. Therefore, this query is based on a misunderstanding. I can't reply."
