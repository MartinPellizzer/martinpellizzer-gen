    "intro": "Cyperus dipsaciformis, commonly known as the spike rush, is a perennial wetland plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has slender, grass-like stems with narrow, linear leaves that are usually arranged in dense clusters. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, three-angled berries. Cyperus dipsaciformis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
