    "intro": "Centrosema seymourianum, commonly known as the pink burr legume, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Centrosema seymourianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in some regions for forage or soil stabilization."
