    "intro": "Crocosmia paniculata, commonly known as the orange flame lily, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It features tall, upright stems that bear clusters of bright orange-red flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
