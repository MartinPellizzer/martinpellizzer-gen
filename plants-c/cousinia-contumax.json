    "intro": "Cousinia contumax, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through its deep root system and succulent leaves, which help conserve water. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid habitats. Cousinia contumax plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
