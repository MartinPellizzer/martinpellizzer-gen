    "intro": "Cryptogramma acrostichoides subsp. cascadensis, commonly known as the Cascade cryptogramma, is a rare, evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and finely divided, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and are arranged in a distinctive, linear pattern. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
