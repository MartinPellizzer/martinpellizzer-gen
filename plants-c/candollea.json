    "intro": "Candollea, commonly known as the golden crown fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble a crown, hence its common name. Candollea species typically grow as epiphytes or terrestrial plants, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the ecological diversity of its native habitats."
