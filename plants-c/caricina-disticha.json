    "intro": "Caricina disticha, commonly known as the slender leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often arranged in a dense, feathery pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in rows."
