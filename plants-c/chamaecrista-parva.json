    "intro": "Chamaecrista parva, commonly known as the small crownflower, is a small, annual legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters, with slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that resemble those of a crown. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its seeds are enclosed in small, hairy pods. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep taproots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions."
