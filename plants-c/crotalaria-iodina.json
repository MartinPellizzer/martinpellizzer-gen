It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and palmate leaves. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.
