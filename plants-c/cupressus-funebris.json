    "intro": "Cupressus funebris, commonly known as the Chinese white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, pyramid-shaped crown and scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. Due to its slow growth and longevity, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and ecological benefits."
