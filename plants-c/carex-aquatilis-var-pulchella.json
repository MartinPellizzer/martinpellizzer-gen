    "intro": "Carex aquatilis var. pulchella, commonly known as the elegant sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. The species is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and support biodiversity."
