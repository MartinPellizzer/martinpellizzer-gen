    "intro": "Crataegus multispina, commonly known as the thorned hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny branches, which are a defining botanical feature, and its clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and has simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Crataegus multispina is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
