    "intro": "Cerionanthus laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth alder, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family, which includes birches and hazelnuts. The plant is characterized by its simple, oval-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. The fruit is a small, winged nutlet that disperses by wind, aiding in its spread across suitable habitats."
