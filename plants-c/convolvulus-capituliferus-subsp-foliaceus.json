    "intro": "Convolvulus capituliferus subsp. foliaceus, commonly known as the leafy morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color, blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. This species is often cultivated as a ground cover or in hanging baskets due to its attractive foliage and delicate flowers."
