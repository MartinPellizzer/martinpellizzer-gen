It is characterized by its hairy, square-stemmed appearance and small, greenish-white flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive look. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. It is considered an invasive species in many areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
