    "intro": "Couepia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. Couepia species are typically shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They produce showy, five-petaled flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields."
