    "intro": "Cypripedium vittatum var. breve, commonly known as the short-stemmed lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like flower that is typically pink or white with a yellow interior. The plant features a single, slender stem that supports a single, showy blossom. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swampy areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
