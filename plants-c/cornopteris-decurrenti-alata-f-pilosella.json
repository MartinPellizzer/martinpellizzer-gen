    "intro": "Cornopteris decurrenti-alata f. pilosella, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the decurrenti-alata form of Cornopteris, a member of the Woodsiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with the pinnae gradually narrowing towards the base, creating a decurrent effect. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests where it contributes to the understory vegetation. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a notable species in botanical studies and ecological surveys."
