    "intro": "Ctenopteris depressa, commonly known as the broadleaf sea\u84b2, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that can form dense mats. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Ctenopteris depressa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments."
