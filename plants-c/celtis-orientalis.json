    "intro": "Celtis orientalis, commonly known as the small-leafed box-elder, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Ulmaceae family and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, with shallow furrows, and it can grow up to 15 meters tall in suitable conditions. Celtis orientalis is often found in woodland edges and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
