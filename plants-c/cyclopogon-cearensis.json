    "intro": "Cyclopogon cearensis, commonly known as the Cearense cyclopogon, is a rare bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
