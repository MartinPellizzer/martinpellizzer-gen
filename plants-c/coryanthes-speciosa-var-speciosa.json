    "intro": "Coryanthes speciosa var. speciosa, commonly known as the giant coryanthe, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, with intricate, colorful patterns on the lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and requires high humidity and bright, indirect light. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific insects, particularly beetles. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in warm, humid environments."
