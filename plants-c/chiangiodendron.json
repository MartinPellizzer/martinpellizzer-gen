    "intro": "Chiangiodendron, commonly known as the Chinese parasol tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Chiangiodendron is often cultivated for its ornamental value and shade-providing canopy. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
