    "intro": "Croton gigantifolius, commonly known as the giant-leaf croton, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by distinctive, spiky fruit capsules. Its foliage is highly ornamental, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor spaces. However, it requires a warm, humid environment to thrive and is sensitive to cold temperatures."
