    "intro": "Cota altissima, commonly known as the tall cota or tall goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny areas such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its roots are fibrous and can spread widely. Cota altissima is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
