It is native to the rainforests of South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers. It typically grows as an epiphytic or lithophytic plant, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
