    "intro": "Coelophragmus auriculatus f. firmior, commonly known as the firm compact form of the auriculate cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to southern Africa. It features a cylindrical stem with a distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) margin, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
