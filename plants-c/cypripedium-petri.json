    "intro": "Cypripedium petri, commonly known as the Petri's lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy pink or purple pouch-like flower, which is adapted to attract specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Cypripedium petri is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
