    "intro": "Corybas holttumii, commonly known as the Holttum's hooded orchid, is a unique member of the\u5170\u79d1 (Orchidaceae) family. It is characterized by its striking, hood-like floral structure that encloses the reproductive organs, a feature typical of the genus Corybas. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo, this plant thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its flowers are usually dark-colored, ranging from deep purple to black, and are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from its host."
