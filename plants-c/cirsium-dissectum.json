    "intro": "Cirsium dissectum, commonly known as the cut-leaved thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, lobed leaves that are deeply dissected, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces purple to pink flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a spherical shape known as a capitulum. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Cirsium dissectum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
