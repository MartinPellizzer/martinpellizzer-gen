    "intro": "Chamaeraphis setosa var. macrostachya, commonly known as the broad-stemmed glassworts, is a halophyte native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in tidal mudflats and salt marshes. The plant has succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of salt crystals, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its small, opposite leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in reducing water loss. The flowers are small and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which are often reddish in color."
