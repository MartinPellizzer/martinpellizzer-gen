It is a small evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its dense, glossy foliage and unique floral structure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical evergreen forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
