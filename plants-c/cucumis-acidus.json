    "intro": "Cucumis acidus, commonly known as the sour gherkin, is a flowering plant in the Cucurbitaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are typically harvested when they are still immature and acidic. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its vines grow horizontally along the ground. The fruit is often used in pickling due to its tart flavor and firm texture."
