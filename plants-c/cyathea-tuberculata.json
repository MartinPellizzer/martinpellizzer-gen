    "intro": "Cyathea tuberculata, commonly known as the mountain tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, light-green fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a distinctive trunk that is covered in a thick, fibrous layer of old leaf bases, giving it a rugged appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forested areas with high humidity. Cyathea tuberculata plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
