    "intro": "Cystopus grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered bladderwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a semi-aquatic or wetland plant that typically grows in shallow water or damp soil. The plant is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that are often pink or purple in color. It has small, bladder-like structures that are used for trapping aquatic prey, a feature typical of its carnivorous relatives. Cystopus grandiflorus is found in various parts of Europe and Asia, often in marshy or pond-edge habitats."
