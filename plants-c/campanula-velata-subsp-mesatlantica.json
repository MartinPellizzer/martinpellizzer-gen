    "intro": "Campanula velata subsp. mesatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems and produces bell-shaped, pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found in dunes and along the edges of salt marshes, where it tolerates high salinity and wind exposure. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal habitats."
