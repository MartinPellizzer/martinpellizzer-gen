    "intro": "Chlamydostylus tenuis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed chlamydostylus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the humid understory of tropical rainforests in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers with a unique structure. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial herb, with slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with a prominent lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chlamydostylus tenuis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
