    "intro": "Coreopsis polycephala, commonly known as the clustered coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The species is valued for its ability to thrive in wetland environments and its role in supporting local pollinators."
