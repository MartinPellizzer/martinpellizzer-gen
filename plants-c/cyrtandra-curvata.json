    "intro": "Cyrtandra curvata, commonly known as the curved-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories on the islands of Hawaii. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyrtandra curvata is considered a rare and endangered species."
