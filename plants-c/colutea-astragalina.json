It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early spring, followed by the development of hairy, triangular pods. Colutea astragalina is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
