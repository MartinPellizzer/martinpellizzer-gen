    "intro": "Calyptrochilum zigzag, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped inflorescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are elongated and glossy, adapted to thrive in the humid, shaded environments of its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Calyptrochilum zigzag is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
