It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Carex pisiformis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
