    "intro": "Caesalpinia monosperma, commonly known as the Indian flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright red or orange, flame-like inflorescences that appear during the dry season. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets, and its flowers are typically clustered in dense, elongated spikes. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release its single, hard, black seed. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
