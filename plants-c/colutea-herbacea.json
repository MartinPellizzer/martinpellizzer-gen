    "intro": "Colutea herbacea, commonly known as the herbaceous colutea, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to regions of Europe and western Asia, often found in rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are pinnately compound with rounded leaflets. It has a low-growing habit and is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The seeds are enclosed in hairy pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
