    "intro": "Cerastium glomeratum var. apetalum, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette at the base, and its stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds."
