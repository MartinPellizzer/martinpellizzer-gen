    "intro": "Carpha junciformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has cylindrical, grass-like leaves that are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. Carpha junciformis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
