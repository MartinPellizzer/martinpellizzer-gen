    "intro": "Callitriche stagnalis subsp. platycarpa, commonly known as broad-fruited water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats. It typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, opposite leaves that are usually oval to lance-shaped. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences near the water surface. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader, more rounded fruits compared to other members of the species."
