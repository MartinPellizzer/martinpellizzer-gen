It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange floral bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures, relying on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often forming dense clusters. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, making it a notable component of native plant communities."
