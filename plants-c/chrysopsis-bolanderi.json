    "intro": "Chrysopsis bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as chaparral and coastal scrub. It produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its small, linear leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment."
