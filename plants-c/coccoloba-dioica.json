    "intro": "Coccoloba dioica, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that range from yellow to red, depending on the species. Its pads, or cladodes, are often used in traditional medicine and cuisine. The plant's ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
