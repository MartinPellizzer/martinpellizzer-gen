    "intro": "Cieca angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cieca, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in terminal inflorescences, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Cieca angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
