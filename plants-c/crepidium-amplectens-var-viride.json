    "intro": "Crepidium amplectens var. viride, commonly known as the green-leafed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and compact, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often growing on tree trunks or rocky substrates. Its leaves are typically broad and slightly curled, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
