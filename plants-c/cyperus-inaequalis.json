    "intro": "Cyperus inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often inconspicuous. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its natural habitat."
