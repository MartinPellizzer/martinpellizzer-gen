    "intro": "Callicarpa cubensis var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Caribbean. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, violet-purple berries that mature in the fall. These berries are edible for humans and birds but are often consumed by wildlife rather than cultivated for human use. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
