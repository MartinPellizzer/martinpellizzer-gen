    "intro": "Cyclamen jovis, commonly known as the Jupiter cyclamen, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and vibrant, showy flowers that range from white to deep pink. The plant produces a single, upward-facing bloom that is often adorned with intricate patterns resembling celestial motifs. Cyclamen jovis thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is considered a delicately endangered species."
