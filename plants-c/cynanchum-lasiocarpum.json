    "intro": "Cynanchum lasiocarpum, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Cynanchum lasiocarpum is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in rocky or sandy habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
