    "intro": "Ceratophyllum submersum var. spinosum, commonly known as spiny watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, whorled leaves that are typically 2\u20134 mm in length. The plant produces tiny, reddish-brown flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often submerged or just below the water surface. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters with moderate to high light penetration. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
