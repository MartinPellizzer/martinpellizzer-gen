    "intro": "Cyathodes, commonly known as the cup-like structures found in certain flowering plants, are specialized inflorescences that serve as a unique adaptation for pollination. These structures typically consist of a single central female flower surrounded by several male flowers, forming a compact, often colorful cluster. The cyathodes are most commonly associated with the genus *Euphorbia*, where they play a crucial role in attracting pollinators such as insects. Their structure allows for efficient pollen transfer and enhances reproductive success in these plants. The presence of cyathodes is a key identifying feature in the family Euphorbiaceae."
