    "intro": "Caloplectus, commonly known as the golden cup, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange composite flowers that resemble small cups, hence their common name. Caloplectus species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. They are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. The genus includes several species, such as Caloplectus acanthocarpus and Caloplectus coccineus, which are native to parts of Africa and the Middle East."
