    "intro": "Coryanthes vinosa, commonly known as the crimson hothouse orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, vivid red flowers that resemble a crown, hence its genus name \"Coryanthes.\" The plant thrives in humid, warm environments and requires high light exposure to bloom properly. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Coryanthes vinosa is often cultivated as a showy ornamental plant due to its dramatic floral display."
