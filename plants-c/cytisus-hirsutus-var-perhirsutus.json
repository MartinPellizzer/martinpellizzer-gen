    "intro": "Cytisus hirsutus var. perhirsutus, commonly known as the hairy broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
