    "intro": "Choretrum spicatum subsp. spicatum, commonly known as the spikeless marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife. Its botanical features make it well adapted to fluctuating water levels and nutrient-rich environments."
