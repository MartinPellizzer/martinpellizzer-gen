    "intro": "Cotoneaster tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. Cotoneaster tomentosus is also valued for its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions, making it a versatile plant in gardens and natural habitats."
