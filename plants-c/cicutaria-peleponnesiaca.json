    "intro": "Cicutaria peleponnesiaca, commonly known as the Greek water cheeseweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy areas, often near water bodies such as lakes and rivers. It is an annual herb that thrives in temperate climates and is known for its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in parts of its native range."
