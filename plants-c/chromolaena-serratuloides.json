It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, often rough-textured leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and is known for its rapid growth and invasive tendencies in some areas. Its leaves are usually serrated and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers appear in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Chromolaena serratuloides is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
