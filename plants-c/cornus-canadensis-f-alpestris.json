    "intro": "Cornus canadensis f. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine dogwood, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the alpine regions of North America. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring, adding delicate beauty to rocky or gravelly soils. The plant has narrow, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. This variant of Cornus canadensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
