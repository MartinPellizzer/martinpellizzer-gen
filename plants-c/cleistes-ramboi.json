    "intro": "Cleistes ramboi, commonly known as the violet bellflower, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its showy, violet-colored flowers that resemble small bells, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically ovate and covered in a fine, hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cleistes ramboi is considered a conservation concern."
