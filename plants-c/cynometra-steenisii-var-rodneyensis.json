    "intro": "Cynometra steenisii var. rodneyensis, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark bark and aromatic leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood used in construction and furniture-making. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
