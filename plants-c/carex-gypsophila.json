    "intro": "Carex gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or gypsum-rich environments. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Carex gypsophila is adapted to withstand drought and high salinity, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions."
