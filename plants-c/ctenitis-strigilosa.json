    "intro": "Ctenitis strigilosa, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and have a rough, textured surface due to the presence of small, overlapping scales. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
