    "intro": "Chthamalia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Cariophyllaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas, thriving in salty, rocky environments. They are characterized by their distinctive blue or purple flowers and succulent leaves adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. Chthamalia species are often used in coastal landscaping due to their hardiness and aesthetic appeal. Their botanical features make them well-suited for ecological restoration projects in sandy or shingle shorelines."
