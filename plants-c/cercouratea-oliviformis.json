    "intro": "Cercouratea oliviformis, commonly known as the olive-shaped fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically green and glossy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Cercouratea oliviformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
