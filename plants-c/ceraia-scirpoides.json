It features long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a fibrous root system adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences. It is commonly found in temperate regions and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its botanical structure supports its role in aquatic ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
