    "intro": "Comesperma strictum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved thornapple, is a perennial shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, thorny growth habit, which provides structural support and protection. The leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a rough texture, while the flowers are small, greenish-white, and arranged in clusters. It produces edible berries that are typically red or yellow when mature, though they are not commonly consumed by humans. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and open woodlands."
