    "intro": "Cotyledon elegans, commonly known as the \"Snow-on-the-Mountain,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically oval or spoon-shaped and can vary in color from green to red or purple depending on light exposure. Cotyledon elegans is well-suited for rock gardens or containers due to its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements."
