    "intro": "Cupaniopsis rhytidocarpa, commonly known as the rough-skin hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a rough, textured surface, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Cupaniopsis rhytidocarpa is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
