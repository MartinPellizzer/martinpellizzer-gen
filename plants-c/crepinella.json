It is native to various regions in Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. The plants typically have upright stems and produce showy, bell-shaped flowers that are often yellow or orange in color. Crepinella species are often found in dry, rocky habitats and are valued for their ornamental appeal. They are generally herbaceous perennials, though some species may behave as annuals depending on the climate."
