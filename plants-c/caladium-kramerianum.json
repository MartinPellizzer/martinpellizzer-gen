    "intro": "Caladium kramerianum, commonly known as the Kramer's arrowleaf caladium, is a tropical perennial plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that come in shades of green, red, and white. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for garden displays. It is often grown as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens due to its sensitivity to direct sunlight."
