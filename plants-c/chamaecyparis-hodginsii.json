    "intro": "Chamaecyparis hodginsii, commonly known as the Townsend's cedar, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage and slender, pyramidal shape. The plant produces small, yellowish cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It has shallow roots and prefers well-drained, acidic soils in moist, shady environments. Due to its limited natural range and habitat loss, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes."
