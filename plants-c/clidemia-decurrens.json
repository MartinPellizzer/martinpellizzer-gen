    "intro": "Clidemia decurrens, commonly known as creeping marshplant or false mallow, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on long pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, elliptic to ovate, and have a rough, hairy texture. Clidemia decurrens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest understories."
