It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense spikes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
