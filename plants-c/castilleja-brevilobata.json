It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reddish to orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a slender, branching stem and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Castilleja brevilobata forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients."
