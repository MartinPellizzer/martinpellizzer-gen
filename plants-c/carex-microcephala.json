It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.
