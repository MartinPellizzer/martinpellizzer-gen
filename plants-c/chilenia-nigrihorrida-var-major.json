    "intro": "Chilenia nigrihorrida var. major, commonly known as the Chilean black-hairy chilenia, is a unique species native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark brown to black hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and elongated, with a leathery texture that helps it withstand harsh weather conditions. This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and limited distribution."
