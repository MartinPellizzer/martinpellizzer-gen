It is a deciduous shrub that can grow up to 3 meters tall, with large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces a large, non-fibrous fruit that ripens quickly, typically within a few weeks after flowering. The fruit's interior contains a soft, aromatic pulp surrounded by a layer of seeds. Botanically, it is classified as a member of the Caricaceae family and is valued for its nutritional content and medicinal properties."
