It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically forms dense clumps and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often concealed by its foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is a common component of mountainous vegetation."
