It features bright yellow flowers with five petals and a single pistil, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has alternate, simple, and usually narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as wetlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
