It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, dark green, pinnate leaves. The plant's trunk is fibrous and covered in a layer of dark, almost black, bark, which gives it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Cordyline wallichii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
