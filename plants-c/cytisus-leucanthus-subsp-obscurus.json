    "intro": "Cytisus leucanthus subsp. obscurus, commonly known as the dark-flowered broom, is a shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are trifoliate, with narrow, leathery lobes, and the plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils. It is often found in open woodland and scrub habitats, where it thrives in full sun. The subspecies is distinguished by its darker flower color and more compact growth form compared to other cytisus species."
