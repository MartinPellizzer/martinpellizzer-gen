It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. It is typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist soil conditions. Cyperus setaceus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental appearance and ability to tolerate waterlogged soils."
