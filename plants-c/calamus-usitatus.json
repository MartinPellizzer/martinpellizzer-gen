    "intro": "Calamus usitatus, commonly known as the common arrowroot, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces\u621f-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shady environments. Its rhizomes are often used as a starch source, though it is distinct from the true arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea). The botanical features of Calamus usitatus make it an important species in both horticulture and traditional medicine."
