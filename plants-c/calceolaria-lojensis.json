    "intro": "Calceolaria lojensis, commonly known as the Loja slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that resemble small cups. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or forested areas, and prefers cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually a vibrant orange or yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calceolaria lojensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
