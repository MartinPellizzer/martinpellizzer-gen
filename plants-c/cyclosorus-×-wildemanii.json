    "intro": "Cyclosorus \u00d7 wildemanii, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, four-leaf clover-like structure, which is typical of its genus. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its leaves are small, floating, and have a delicate, feathery appearance. Due to its limited distribution and hybrid origin, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
