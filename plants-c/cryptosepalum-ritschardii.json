    "intro": "Cryptosepalum ritschardii, commonly known as the Ritschard's cryptosepalum, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its distinctive floral structure. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the cooler months. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
