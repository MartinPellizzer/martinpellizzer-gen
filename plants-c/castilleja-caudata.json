    "intro": "Castilleja caudata, commonly known as the long-stemmed Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb water and nutrients from host plants, such as grasses and shrubs. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of its host. Castilleja caudata is often found in open, sunny habitats like meadows and woodland edges."
