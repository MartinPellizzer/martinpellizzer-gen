    "intro": "Catapodium tuberculosum, commonly known as the tuberculate catapodium, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinct waxy coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
