    "intro": "Cacalia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessileleaf bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a petiole, giving it a distinctive appearance. Cacalia sessilifolia is a perennial herb that blooms in late spring to early summer."
