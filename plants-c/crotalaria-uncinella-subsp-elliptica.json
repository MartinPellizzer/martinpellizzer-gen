It is characterized by its elliptical leaves and distinctive yellow flowers with a prominent central stamen. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Crotalaria uncinella."
