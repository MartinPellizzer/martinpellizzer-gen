    "intro": "Comostemum, commonly known as the false sandwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae. These plants are typically small, herbaceous perennials that thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. They are characterized by their succulent leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The leaves are often fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss. Comostemum species are native to regions of southern Africa, the Mediterranean, and parts of Asia."
