    "intro": "Carex extensa f. balbisii, commonly known as the Balbisii sedge, is a variant of the broadleaf sedge native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial plant characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
