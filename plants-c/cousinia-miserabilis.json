It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, harsh environments. Cousinia miserabilis is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a resilient species in its native habitat."
