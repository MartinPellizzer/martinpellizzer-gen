    "intro": "Cnicus serrulatus, commonly known as the prickly goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with serrated, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is known for its rough, sometimes prickly texture. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Cnicus serrulatus has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and astringent properties."
