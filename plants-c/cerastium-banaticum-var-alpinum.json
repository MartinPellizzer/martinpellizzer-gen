    "intro": "Cerastium banaticum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its delicate appearance and habitat, it is often found in mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
