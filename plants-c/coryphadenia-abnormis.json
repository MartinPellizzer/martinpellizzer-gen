    "intro": "Coryphadenia abnormis, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and a stout, unbranched trunk that can grow several meters in height. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to its ornamental value. However, it is also considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and over-collection."
