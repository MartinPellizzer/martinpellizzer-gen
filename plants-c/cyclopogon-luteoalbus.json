    "intro": "Cyclopogon luteoalbus, commonly known as the yellow white sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to the wetlands and marshy areas of South America, particularly in Brazil. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in coastal and freshwater wetlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
