It is a herbaceous annual with showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and coastal scrub. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often reddish in color. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
