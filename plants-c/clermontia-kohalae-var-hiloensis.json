    "intro": "Clermontia kohalae var. hiloensis, commonly known as Hilo's mountain ginger, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively on the island of Hawaii. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its striking, showy white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats at high elevations. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
