    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha var. pectinata, commonly known as the Woolly Hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive woolly texture on the underside. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
