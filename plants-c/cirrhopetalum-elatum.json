    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum elatum, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, often with a fuzzy or woolly texture on the petals. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually hairy and arranged in a basal rosette, which helps protect it from harsh weather. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
