    "intro": "Crepidium variabile, commonly known as the variable orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces small, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically broad and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the base of the plant. Crepidium variabile is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to a range of growing conditions."
