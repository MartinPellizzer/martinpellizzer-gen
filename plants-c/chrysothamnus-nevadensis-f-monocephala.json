    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nevadensis f. monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed goldenbush, is a rare subspecies native to the high elevations of Nevada. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold, dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits."
