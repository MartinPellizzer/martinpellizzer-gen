    "intro": "Crotalaria grandis, commonly known as the large crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring erect stems and palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by distinctive pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, also known as the legume or pea family, and is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Crotalaria grandis is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
