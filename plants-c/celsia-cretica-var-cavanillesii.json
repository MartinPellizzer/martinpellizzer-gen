    "intro": "Celsia cretica var. cavanillesii, commonly known as the Cretan celsia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Crete. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in limestone areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
