    "intro": "Cystopteris rufescens, commonly known as the rusty fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a reddish-brown hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a specialized indusium. Cystopteris rufescens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained, acidic soils."
