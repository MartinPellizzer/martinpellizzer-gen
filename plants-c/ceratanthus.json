    "intro": "Ceratanthus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, spiky flowers that often resemble thistles, and their silver-gray foliage. Ceratanthus species are typically found in coastal areas and saline soils, adapting well to harsh, windy environments. They produce small, spherical seed heads that are often used in ornamental gardening. The genus includes several species, such as Ceratanthus alpinus and Ceratanthus siliquosus, which are valued for their hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
