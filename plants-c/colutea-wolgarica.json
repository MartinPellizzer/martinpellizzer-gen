    "intro": "Colutea wolgarica, commonly known as the Caucasian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of legumes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, hairy pod that splits open when mature. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by influencing the growth and distribution of its host species."
