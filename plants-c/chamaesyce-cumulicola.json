    "intro": "Chamaesyce cumulicola, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant has small, green, succulent-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, appearing in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
