    "intro": "Camara chamaedrifolia, commonly known as the creeping camara, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, leathery leaves that are arranged in a compact, mat-like form. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodland environments. Camara chamaedrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form a dense ground cover."
