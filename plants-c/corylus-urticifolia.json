    "intro": "Corylus urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, irritating hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, yellowish male catkins and female flowers that develop into edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in the understory of forests. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
