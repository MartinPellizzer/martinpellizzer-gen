    "intro": "Cactus polytrichus, commonly known as the hairless cactus, is a unique species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its lack of spines, distinguishing it from other cactus species. The plant has a short, thick stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its leaves are modified into small, scale-like structures that reduce water loss. Despite its name, it is not closely related to true cacti but belongs to the family Polytrichaceae, which includes mosses and some other primitive plants."
