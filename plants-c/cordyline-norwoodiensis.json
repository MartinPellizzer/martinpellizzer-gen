    "intro": "Cordyline norwoodiensis, commonly known as the Norfolk Island cabbage tree, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to Norfolk Island. It features a slender, unbranched trunk with a smooth, greyish-brown bark and spirally arranged leaves that are lanceolate and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters at the base of the leaves, followed by red berries that contain viable seeds. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the unique climate of Norfolk Island, where it plays a significant ecological role. Due to its restricted distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and important species for conservation efforts."
