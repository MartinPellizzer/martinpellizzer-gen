    "intro": "Carex caryophyllea f. subpolyrrhiza, commonly known as the woolly sedge, is a variant of the common sedge species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with a distinctive woolly texture on the leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of water bodies. It produces small, clustered spikelets that mature into brown, cylindrical structures, typical of the Cyperaceae family. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
