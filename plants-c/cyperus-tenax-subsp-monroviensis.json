    "intro": "Cyperus tenax subsp. monroviensis, commonly known as the African sedges, is a species of sedge native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and clustered, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three stamens and a three-lobed pistil, typical of the Cyperaceae family."
