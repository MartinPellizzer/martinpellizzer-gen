    "intro": "Cyclosorus brooksii, commonly known as the Brooks' water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes that produce small, delicate fronds with a distinctive fan-like shape. Its leaves are typically green and have a soft, feathery texture, which helps it thrive in moist environments. Cyclosorus brooksii plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
