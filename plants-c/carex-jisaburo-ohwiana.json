It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common component of wetland ecosystems."
