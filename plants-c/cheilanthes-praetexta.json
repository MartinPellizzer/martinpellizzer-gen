    "intro": "Cheilanthes praetexta, commonly known as the speckled rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often speckled with brown or black spots. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces spores in small, clustered clusters on the underside of its fronds. Cheilanthes praetexta is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental appearance and ecological resilience."
