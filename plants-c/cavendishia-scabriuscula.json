    "intro": "Cavendishia scabriuscula, commonly known as the rough-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its rough, scaly leaves and clusters of small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. It has a sympodial growth habit, meaning it grows in segments rather than from a single stem. Cavendishia scabriuscula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses for its unique foliage and floral display."
