    "intro": "Chenopodium macrospermum subsp. crassicaule, commonly known as thick-stemmed goosefoot, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are encased in a hard, spiky capsule. It is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This species is also notable for its potential use in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals."
