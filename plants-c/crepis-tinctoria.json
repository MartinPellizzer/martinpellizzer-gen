    "intro": "Crepis tinctoria, commonly known as the dyer's cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its bright yellow flowers bloom from June to August, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypselae. Historically, it was used for dyeing fabrics due to its vivid yellow pigments."
