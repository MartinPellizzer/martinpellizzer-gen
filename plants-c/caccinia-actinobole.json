    "intro": "Caccinia actinobole, commonly known as the red-stemmed ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern regions of Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically a deep green color, arranged in a compact, upright habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in late spring, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for use in native gardens and as a hedging plant."
