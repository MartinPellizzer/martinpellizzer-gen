    "intro": "Calytriplex obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in areas with low water availability. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a dense, cylindrical cluster. Calytriplex obovata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
