    "intro": "Chimonanthus nitens, commonly known as the yellow lantern tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy texture. Chimonanthus nitens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
