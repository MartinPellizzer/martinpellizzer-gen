    "intro": "Chamaecytisus ciliatus subsp. falcatus, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, leathery leaves with a distinctive ciliate margin. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden use, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
