    "intro": "Columnea muenscheri, commonly known as the silver leaf columnea, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has velvety, dark green leaves with a silvery underside, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea muenscheri is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
