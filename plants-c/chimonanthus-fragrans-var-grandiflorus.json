It is characterized by its striking orange-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, preceding the foliage. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn, adding to its seasonal appeal. Its flowers are borne in clusters and have a fragrant, spicy scent, which attracts pollinators. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
