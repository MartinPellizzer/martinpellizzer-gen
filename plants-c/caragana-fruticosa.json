    "intro": "Caragana fruticosa, commonly known as the shrub locust, is a deciduous shrub native to the steppes and mountains of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 10 to 20 pairs of leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers in early summer, followed by legume pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to dry, arid environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils. Caragana fruticosa is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
