    "intro": "Callipteris undulosa, commonly known as the coastal maidenhair fern, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its fine, feathery foliage. The plant typically grows in wet, sandy soils near coastal areas, often in salt marshes or along the edges of tidal flats. Its delicate, arching leaves are adapted to tolerate salt spray and periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Callipteris undulosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
