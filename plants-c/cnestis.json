    "intro": "Cnestis, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which is often toxic to herbivores. Cnestis species typically have opposite, simple leaves and produce showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple. They are native to various regions in Africa and are often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants."
