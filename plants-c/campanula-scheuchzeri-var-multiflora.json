    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri var. multiflora, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of down, which helps to reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment. Campanula scheuchzeri var. multiflora thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra."
