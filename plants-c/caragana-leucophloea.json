    "intro": "Caragana leucophloea, commonly known as the white-flowered shrub or white-barked caragana, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems that often have a distinctive white or pale bark. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated margin. Caragana leucophloea is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
