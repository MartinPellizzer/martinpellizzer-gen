It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Ceraia juncea is often found in desert scrub and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
