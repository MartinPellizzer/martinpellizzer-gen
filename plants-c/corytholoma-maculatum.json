It features a rosette of broad, fleshy, spotted leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems topped with clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats. The spotted leaves and delicate flowers make it a distinctive and attractive member of the bellflower family."
