    "intro": "Cytisus alpestris, commonly known as the alpine broom, is a flowering shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces trifoliate leaves, which are trifoliate in appearance, and has a woody structure that allows it to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas at high altitudes. Cytisus alpestris is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which helps improve soil fertility in nutrient-poor habitats."
