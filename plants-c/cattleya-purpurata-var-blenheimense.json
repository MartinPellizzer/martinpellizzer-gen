It features large, showy blooms with a deep purple coloration and yellowish-green markings, typical of the Cattleya genus. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
