    "intro": "Cirsium novoleonense, commonly known as the Novoleonese thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and large, purple-blue flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and wastelands. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
