    "intro": "Carex maximowiczii var. subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream sides. The plant features grass-like leaves that are narrow and strap-shaped, with a prominent midrib. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-stamened flowers, which are often subtended by bracts. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact inflorescence compared to other Carex species."
