It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped tubers underground, which serve as storage organs for nutrients. Its leaves are basal and trifoliate, with three leaflets arranged in a palmate pattern. Corydalis qilianshanica is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil."
