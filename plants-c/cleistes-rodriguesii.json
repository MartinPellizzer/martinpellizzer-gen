    "intro": "Cleistes rodriguesii, commonly known as the Rodrigues orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant has a short, hairy stem and produces a single, elongated flower with a distinctive lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
