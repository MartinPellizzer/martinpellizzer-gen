    "intro": "Corymbia opaca, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to northern Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters. The tree is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin sheets, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a grey-green hue. The flowers are small and white or pink, clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences, and are an important food source for native pollinators."
