    "intro": "Coelandria, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters, and are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Coelandria species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in a variety of habitats including wetlands and disturbed soils. They are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
