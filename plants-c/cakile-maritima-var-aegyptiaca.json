    "intro": "Cakile maritima var. aegyptiaca, commonly known as the Egyptian sea rocket, is a halophyte native to the Mediterranean and parts of North Africa. It thrives in coastal and saline environments, showcasing adaptations such as succulent leaves and a deep root system to tolerate high salt concentrations. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a distinctive triangular stem. Its leaves are alternate, lobed, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
