    "intro": "Coppensia loefgrenii, commonly known as the dwarf pygmy orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or in rock crevices. It has a short growth cycle and is known for its ephemeral flowering, which occurs during the wet season. Coppensia loefgrenii is a rare and endangered species, making it a significant subject of conservation efforts."
