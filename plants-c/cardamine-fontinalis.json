    "intro": "Cardamine fontinalis, commonly known as spring cress, is a small flowering plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It typically grows in rocky or streamside habitats, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowers are clustered in racemes and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. Cardamine fontinalis is often found in calcareous soils and is a characteristic species of forested stream valleys."
