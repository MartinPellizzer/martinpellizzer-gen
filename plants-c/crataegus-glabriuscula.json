    "intro": "Crataegus glabriuscula, commonly known as the smooth hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and thornless stems. The plant produces white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by red berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with finely toothed margins, and they turn yellow in autumn. Crataegus glabriuscula is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
