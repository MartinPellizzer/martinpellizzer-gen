    "intro": "Centaurium pterocaule, commonly known as the winged chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in clusters at the tips of its stems. The plant has slender, hairy stems and leaves that are narrow and pointed, often with a slightly wavy edge. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive wing-like structures on the stems, which are a notable botanical feature."
