    "intro": "Carpinus londoniana, commonly known as the London plane tree, is a deciduous tree native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It is highly adaptable and can thrive in urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soil. Its rapid growth and stately appearance make it a popular choice for street planting and urban landscapes."
