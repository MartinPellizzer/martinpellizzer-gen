    "intro": "Cyclophorus rupestris, commonly known as the rock cyclophorus, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of South Africa. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which includes many succulent species adapted to dry environments. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that help store water, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rock faces or in gravelly areas. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular choice for rock gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
