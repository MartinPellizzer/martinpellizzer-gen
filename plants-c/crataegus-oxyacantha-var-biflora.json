    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha var. biflora, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant is often used in hedgerows for its hardy nature and ornamental value. Crataegus oxyacantha var. biflora is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential cardiovascular benefits."
