    "intro": "Cassia mexicana var. grandiflora, commonly known as the Mexican flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often bipinnate and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces large, bright yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. The seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
