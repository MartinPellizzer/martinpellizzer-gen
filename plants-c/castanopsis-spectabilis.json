    "intro": "Castanopsis spectabilis, commonly known as the silver leaf tallowwood, is a species of evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn silver-white underneath. The tree produces small, cup-shaped fruits that enclose edible seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tall eucalyptus forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions."
