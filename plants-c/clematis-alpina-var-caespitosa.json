    "intro": "Clematis alpina var. caespitosa, commonly known as the Alpine Clematis, is a perennial vine native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, wiry stems that climb or trail along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is finely divided, with feathery leaves that are aromatic when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
