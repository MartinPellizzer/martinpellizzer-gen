    "intro": "Cochemiea schumannii, commonly known as the Schumann's cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is often covered in dense, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a container plant."
