    "intro": "Capnites brevis, commonly known as the short-stemmed capnites, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a mild, spicy scent when crushed. Due to its limited habitat and low population numbers, Capnites brevis is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
