    "intro": "Corydalis lhorongensis, commonly known as the Lhorongensis Corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky habitats. Due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
