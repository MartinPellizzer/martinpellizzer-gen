    "intro": "Cerastites, commonly known as the yellow dandelion or crown vetch, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. The plants are characterized by their trifoliate leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring. They are often used in landscaping due to their hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils. Additionally, some species are known for their nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making them beneficial in soil enrichment."
