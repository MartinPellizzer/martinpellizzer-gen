    "intro": "Cyperus neoschimperi var. subvirescens, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist, sandy soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, a characteristic common in the Cyperaceae family. This variant is distinguished by its slightly greenish hue compared to the typical form of Cyperus neoschimperi."
