    "intro": "Caltha palustris f. simonkaiana, commonly known as the yellow marsh cinquefoil, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its bright yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The subspecies simonkaiana is distinguished by its slightly larger flowers and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Caltha palustris."
