    "intro": "Clematis coloradoensis, commonly known as the Colorado clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a climbing plant. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
