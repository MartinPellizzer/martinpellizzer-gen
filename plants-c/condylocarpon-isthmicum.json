    "intro": "Condylocarpon isthmicum, commonly known as the Isthmian lichen, is a crustose lichen that forms a thin, continuous layer on rock surfaces. It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange thallus, which is rich in secondary metabolites. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid and shaded environments. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for ecological health."
