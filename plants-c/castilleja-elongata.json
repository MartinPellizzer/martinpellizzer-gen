    "intro": "Castilleja elongata, commonly known as the elongated paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red to orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, often branching stems and lacks true leaves, relying on its host plants for nutrients. Its roots form haustoria, which penetrate the roots of nearby plants to extract water and minerals. Castilleja elongata is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, where it thrives in full sun."
