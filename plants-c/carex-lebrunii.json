    "intro": "Carex lebrunii, commonly known as Lebrun's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in environments with consistent hydration. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, facilitating wind pollination. Carex lebrunii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
