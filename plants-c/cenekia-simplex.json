    "intro": "Cenekia simplex, commonly known as the simple cenekia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes trees and shrubs known for their aromatic wood and medicinal properties. The plant features simple, alternate leaves with a smooth surface and a slightly serrated margin. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
