    "intro": "Cuscuta elpassiana, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that twine around its host. The plant is native to parts of the Americas and is often found growing on grasses and other low-growing vegetation. Its life cycle involves germinating on the surface of the host plant and then penetrating it with haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops if left unchecked."
