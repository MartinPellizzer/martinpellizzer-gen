    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia subf. bracteata, commonly known as the bracted bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are rounded and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. This subspecies is distinguished by the presence of bracts\u2014modified leaves at the base of the flower cluster\u2014that are often smaller and more pronounced than in the typical form. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats."
