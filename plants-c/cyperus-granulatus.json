    "intro": "Cyperus granulatus, commonly known as the rough sedges, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and spikelet inflorescences. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually wind-pollinated. Cyperus granulatus is notable for its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it a common species in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
