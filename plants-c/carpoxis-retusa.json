    "intro": "Carpoxis retusa, commonly known as the smooth carpetgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette and are covered in a fine, waxy coating. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
