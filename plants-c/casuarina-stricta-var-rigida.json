    "intro": "Casuarina stricta var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid she-oak, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and distinctive cylindrical seed pods. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are often mistaken for true leaves, and it produces yellowish flowers in clusters. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in dune environments. Casuarina stricta var. rigida is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in coastal areas."
