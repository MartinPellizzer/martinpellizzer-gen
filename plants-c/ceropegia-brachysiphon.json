    "intro": "Ceropegia brachysiphon, commonly known as the narrow-siphon milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent species characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Ceropegia brachysiphon is adapted to survive in low-water conditions, making it a resilient choice for xerophytic gardens."
