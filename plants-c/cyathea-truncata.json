    "intro": "Cyathea truncata, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a thick layer of persistent, fibrous roots. The plant has a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea truncata is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It plays an important role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
