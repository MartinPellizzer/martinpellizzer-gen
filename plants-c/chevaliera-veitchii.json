    "intro": "Chevaliera veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's chevaliera, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a threatened species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
