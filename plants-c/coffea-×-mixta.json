    "intro": "Coffea \u00d7 mixta, commonly known as the Java coffee plant, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora. It is characterized by its evergreen shrub form, with dark green, leathery leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries containing two seeds, which are used to make coffee. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a combination of traits from both parent species, making it unique in the Coffea genus."
