    "intro": "Cosmos palmeri var. typicus, commonly known as the Palmer's cosmos, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
