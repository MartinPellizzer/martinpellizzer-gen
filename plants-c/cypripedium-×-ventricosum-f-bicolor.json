    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 ventricosum f. bicolor, commonly known as the bicolor lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a distinctive white and pink coloration. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in acidic soil conditions. It features a single, pouch-like lip that is a key identifying feature of the Cypripedium genus. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts aim to protect its natural populations."
