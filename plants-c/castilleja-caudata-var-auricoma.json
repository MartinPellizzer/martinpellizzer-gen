    "intro": "Castilleja caudata var. auricoma, commonly known as the golden crowfoot, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, and it forms symbiotic relationships with certain root fungi. Due to its parasitic nature, it relies on host plants for some of its nutrients, making it an important component of its ecological community."
