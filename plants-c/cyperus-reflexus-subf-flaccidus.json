It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow water areas, and is often found in disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
