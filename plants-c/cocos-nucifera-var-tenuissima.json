    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. tenuissima, commonly known as the slender coconut or dwarf coconut, is a variety of the coconut palm characterized by its shorter stature and narrower leaves. It produces small, compact coconuts that are typically harvested earlier than those of the standard coconut variety. This plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained sandy soils. Its leaves are long and narrow, often reaching lengths of up to 3 meters, and its trunk is slender compared to other coconut palms. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and as a source of edible coconuts in smaller quantities."
