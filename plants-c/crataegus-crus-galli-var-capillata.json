    "intro": "Crataegus crus-galli var. capillata, commonly known as the common hawthorn or maytree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, simple oval leaves, and clusters of small white or pink flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed sites. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in both horticulture and natural ecosystems."
