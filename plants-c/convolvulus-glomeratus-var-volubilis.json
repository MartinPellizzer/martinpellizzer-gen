    "intro": "Convolvulus glomeratus var. volubilis, commonly known as the clustered bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate or trailing growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or white, blooming in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and persistent seed production."
