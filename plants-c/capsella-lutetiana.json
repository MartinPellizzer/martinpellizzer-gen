    "intro": "Capsella lutetiana, commonly known as the French bellflower, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Capsella lutetiana is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
