    "intro": "Championella oligantha, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and hairy, green to gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested, a common feature among plants in the milkweed family. Championella oligantha is adapted to hot, dry climates and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
