    "intro": "Crotalaria perrottetii, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that produces bright yellow flowers with distinctive spurred petals. The plant is known for its ability to self-seed and is often found in disturbed soils and grasslands. Its seeds are encased in a hard, dry pod that splits open when mature. The plant has been introduced to other regions and is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
