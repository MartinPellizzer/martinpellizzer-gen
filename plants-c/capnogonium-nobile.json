    "intro": "Capnogonium nobile, commonly known as the noble mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features upright, slender stems covered in soft, gray-green foliage that resembles a misty haze. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its unique appearance. Capnogonium nobile is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
