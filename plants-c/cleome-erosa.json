    "intro": "Cleome erosa, commonly known as the common spiderflower, is an annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its branching stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that resemble spider legs, hence its common name. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its flowers are typically borne in terminal clusters. Cleome erosa thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in gardens. It is a popular choice for ornamental use due to its unique appearance and ease of cultivation."
