It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves, and showy white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along roadsides. The common hawthorn is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
