    "intro": "Couratari reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate couratari, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lecythidaceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Peru, and Colombia. The plant is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves with a distinctive reticulate venation pattern. It produces yellowish-orange flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are woody, capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various insect and bird species."
