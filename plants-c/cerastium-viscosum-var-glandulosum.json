    "intro": "Cerastium viscosum var. glandulosum, commonly known as sticky mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are typically arranged in umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its sticky foliage and delicate flowers make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to gardens."
