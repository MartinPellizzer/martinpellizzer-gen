    "intro": "Couepia paraensis subsp. cerradoana, commonly known as the Cerrado couepia, is a shrub native to the Cerrado biome of Brazil. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the seasonal climate of the Cerrado. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native range."
