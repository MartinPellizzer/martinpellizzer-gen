    "intro": "Cerastium gibraltaricum var. viridulum, commonly known as the Gibraltar green mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early spring, which are arranged in umbels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
