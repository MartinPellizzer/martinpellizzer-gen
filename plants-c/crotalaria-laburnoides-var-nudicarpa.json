    "intro": "Crotalaria laburnoides var. nudicarpa, commonly known as the naked-seed crotalaria, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces elongated, slender pods that remain attached to the plant after maturity. Its seeds are typically enclosed in a fleshy, membranous covering, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Crotalaria. This species is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant floral display and ecological benefits as a nitrogen-fixing plant."
