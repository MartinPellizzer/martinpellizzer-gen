    "intro": "Cercidium floridum, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, featuring woody stems and small, fuzzy leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers during the spring and early summer. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in drought conditions. Cercidium floridum is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
