    "intro": "Caladium appunianum, commonly known as the red-veined caladium, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful leaves that often display shades of white, pink, and red, with prominent veins. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for gardens and indoor spaces. Caladium appunianum is typically propagated through tuberous roots, which can be planted in spring for optimal growth."
