    "intro": "Corydalis gigantea var. macrantha, commonly known as the giant corydalis, is a striking member of the Fumariaceae family native to the mountainous regions of China. This perennial herb is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with lance-shaped, dark green leaves. Its most notable feature is the showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red, often with contrasting black markings. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a valuable addition to woodland gardens."
