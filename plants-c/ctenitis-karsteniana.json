    "intro": "Ctenitis karsteniana, commonly known as the Karsten's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome system supports its upright structure, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. Ctenitis karsteniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
