    "intro": "Campomanesia aprica, commonly known as the Brazilian wax apple, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by orange-red, wax-coated fruits. The fruit's unique waxy coating helps protect it from pests and aids in seed dispersal. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit, which has a tart, honey-like flavor."
