    "intro": "Capeobolus brevicaulis, commonly known as the Cape Peninsula sandwort, is a small, perennial plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the harsh, maritime climate of the Cape Peninsula. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Capeobolus brevicaulis is an important part of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its coastal habitat."
