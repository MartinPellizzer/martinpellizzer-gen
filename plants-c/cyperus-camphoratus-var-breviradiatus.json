It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps and floodplains, and is often found in disturbed soils. Its flowering spikes are usually small and clustered, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
