    "intro": "Calamus katikii, commonly known as the New Guinea calamus, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It is a tall, slender palm-like plant that can grow up to several meters in height, characterized by its long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in inflorescences, which are followed by clustered, dark blue-black fruits. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds. Calamus katikii thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in lowland rainforests."
