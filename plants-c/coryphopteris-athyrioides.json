    "intro": "Coryphopteris athyrioides, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
