It is characterized by its thorny branches, simple oval leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red to orange berries in the fall, which are edible but often sour. It thrives in temperate climates and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and adaptability to various soil types."
