    "intro": "Carex polyrrhiza f. subintegra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. The plant is valued for its ecological role in water filtration and as a component of wetland restoration projects."
