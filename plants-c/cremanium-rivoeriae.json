    "intro": "Cremanium rivoeriae, commonly known as the R\u00edo de la Plata ironwood, is a rare and woody shrub native to the humid subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as riverbanks and forest understories. Its hard, heavy wood has historically been used for construction and tool-making. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered in many parts of its native range."
