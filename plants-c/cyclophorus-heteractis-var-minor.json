    "intro": "Cyclophorus heteractis var. minor, commonly known as the lesser cyclophorus, is a rare flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered umbels of white to pale yellow flowers. The leaves are pinnately divided, with a finely toothed margin, and the plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils. It is found in specific regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
