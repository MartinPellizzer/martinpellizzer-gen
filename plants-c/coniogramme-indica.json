    "intro": "Coniogramme indica, commonly known as the Indian fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, compound fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to soil or rock surfaces. Coniogramme indica is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
