It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are pinnate, consisting of several small, oval leaflets, and the plant produces pods that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
