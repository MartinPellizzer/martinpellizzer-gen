    "intro": "Caesalpinia, commonly known as the flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its bright, fiery red or orange flowers that resemble flames, often appearing in clusters. The leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. Caesalpinia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and Africa. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value and can also fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting the surrounding ecosystem."
