    "intro": "Cenchrus pennisetiformis var. brevisetosus, commonly known as the short-bristled dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-nutrient environments."
