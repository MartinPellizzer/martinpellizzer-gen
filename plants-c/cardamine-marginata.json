    "intro": "Cardamine marginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf watercress, is a delicate flowering plant native to moist, temperate regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants. The plant features small, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in shaded, wet environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rapid growth and short life cycle make it a common indicator of nutrient-rich, waterlogged soils."
