    "intro": "Chaetaria interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its common name. Chaetaria interrupta is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks."
