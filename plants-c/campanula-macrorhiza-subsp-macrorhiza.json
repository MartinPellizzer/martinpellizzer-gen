    "intro": "Campanula macrorhiza subsp. macrorhiza, commonly known as the large-rooted bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems that can grow up to 60 cm tall, bearing opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is robust and fibrous, contributing to its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks."
