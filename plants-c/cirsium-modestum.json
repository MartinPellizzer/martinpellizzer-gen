    "intro": "Cirsium modestum, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. Its leaves are covered in stiff, prickly hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The flowers are arranged in a composite head, consisting of both ray and disk florets, typical of the daisy family."
