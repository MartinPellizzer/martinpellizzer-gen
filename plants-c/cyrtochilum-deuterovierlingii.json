    "intro": "Cyrtochilum deuterovierlingii, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pinkish-purple pouch-shaped flower that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions with partial shade. Its foliage consists of broad, fleshy leaves that help it store water in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this species is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
