    "intro": "Circaea lutetiana subvar. cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaved wintergreen, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It features small, opposite, ovate to cordate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are often tinged with pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its aromatic foliage and early blooming habit make it a notable component of forest understory vegetation."
