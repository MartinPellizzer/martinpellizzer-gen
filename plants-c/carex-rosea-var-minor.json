    "intro": "Carex rosea var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf rose marsh sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a deep green, with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in early summer, adding a subtle floral display. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as part of naturalized landscapes."
