    "intro": "Cabobanthus polysphaerus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, globular flower heads that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
