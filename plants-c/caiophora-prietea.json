    "intro": "Caiophora prietea, commonly known as the Priete's caiophora, is a rare and little-studied plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Caiophoraceae, which is characterized by its unique floral structures and specialized adaptations to extreme environments. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and exhibits a compact, shrub-like growth form. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink, which attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited research, Caiophora prietea remains a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
