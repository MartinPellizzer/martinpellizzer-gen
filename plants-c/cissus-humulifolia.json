    "intro": "Cissus humulifolia, commonly known as the ivy creeper or honey vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its tendrils that help it climb and attach to surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are heart-shaped, opposite, and often covered with small, translucent glands. Cissus humulifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
