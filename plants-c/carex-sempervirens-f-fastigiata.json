    "intro": "Carex sempervirens f. fastigiata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a compact, evergreen plant with upright, grass-like foliage. It features narrow, dark green leaves that are tightly packed, giving it a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are typically followed by pale brown seed heads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. This ornamental sedge is often used in water gardens or as a ground cover in shaded landscapes."
