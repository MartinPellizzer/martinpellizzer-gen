It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap, which has been used traditionally for medicinal and incense purposes. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, while its fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature."
