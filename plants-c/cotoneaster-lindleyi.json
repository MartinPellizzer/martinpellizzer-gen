    "intro": "Cotoneaster lindleyi, commonly known as the Lindley cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy on top. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes in temperate climates."
