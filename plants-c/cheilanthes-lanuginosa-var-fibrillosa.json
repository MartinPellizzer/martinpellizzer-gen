    "intro": "Cheilanthes lanuginosa var. fibrillosa, commonly known as the hairy moonwort, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. It is a lithophytic plant, typically growing on rock surfaces, and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with a dense covering of fine, hairy structures, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a soft, velvety texture, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its fronds. This variety is noted for its resilience and ability to thrive in low-nutrient, rocky soils."
