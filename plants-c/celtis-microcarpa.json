    "intro": "Celtis microcarpa, commonly known as the little-leaf hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by smooth, greenish fruits that mature to a dark blue or black color. Celtis microcarpa is often found in moist bottomlands and along streams, and it has a shallow root system that makes it susceptible to windthrow. Its fruit is an important food source for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals."
