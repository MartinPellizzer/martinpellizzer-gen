    "intro": "Cerastium tetragonum, commonly known as mouse ear chickweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. It has a sprawling growth habit, with stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. Its botanical features make it a common weed in gardens and a valuable component of moist, temperate ecosystems."
