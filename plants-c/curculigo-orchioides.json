    "intro": "Curculigo orchioides, commonly known as the orchid root or the African orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate orchid-like flowers. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces a fleshy, tuberous root system that is often harvested for medicinal use. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and sometimes hairy, while its flowers are typically white or pale pink with a distinct lip. Curculigo orchioides is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties."
