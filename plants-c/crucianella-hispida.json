    "intro": "Crucianella hispida, commonly known as the hairy crucianella, is a small, evergreen shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in coastal areas, sandy soils, and dunes, where it thrives in saline and well-drained conditions. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late spring. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed and coastal habitats."
