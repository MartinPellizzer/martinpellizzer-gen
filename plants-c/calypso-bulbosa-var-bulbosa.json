    "intro": "Calypso bulbosa var. bulbosa, commonly known as the naked lady, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and orange, often appearing in late summer or early autumn. The plant produces a cluster of strap-like leaves that emerge from the base of the bulb. Its bulbs are fleshy and store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
