It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in coastal environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It is native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe and North Africa. Chamaeraphis macrostachya is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds."
