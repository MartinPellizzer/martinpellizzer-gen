    "intro": "Chienia, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom above the water surface, while its leaves are broad and floating. The plant has a deep root system that anchors it in muddy substrates, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving water. Chienia's flowers are typically pink or white, with a central yellow stamen, and they emit a subtle fragrance. It plays an important role in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental beauty."
