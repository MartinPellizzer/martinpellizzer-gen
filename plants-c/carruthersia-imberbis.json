It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to purple, attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
