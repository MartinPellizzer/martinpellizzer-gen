It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves with prominent venation. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
