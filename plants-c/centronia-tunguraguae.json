    "intro": "Centronia tunguraguae, commonly known as the Tunguragua centronia, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within cloud forests, where it relies on specific microclimatic conditions for survival. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying biodiversity in the region. Conservation efforts are crucial due to its vulnerability to habitat loss and climate change."
