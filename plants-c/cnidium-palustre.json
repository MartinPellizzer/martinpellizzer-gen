    "intro": "Cnidium palustre, commonly known as marsh snakeroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, creeping stems that produce small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive, aromatic scent. Cnidium palustre is notable for its chemical compounds, including various coumarins, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties."
