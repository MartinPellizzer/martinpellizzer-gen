    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 aurantium var. pyriformis, commonly known as the pomelo or sometimes the Chinese grapefruit, is a citrus species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elongated, and often asymmetrical fruits, which can weigh up to 10 pounds. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves and produces fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is typically used for its sweet, slightly acidic juice and is also used in traditional medicine. The botanical name reflects its hybrid origin, as it is a cross between different citrus species."
