    "intro": "Calyptridium monandrum, commonly known as the narrowleaf calyptridium, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its small, elongated leaves are usually less than 10 centimeters in length, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Calyptridium monandrum is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
