It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant is often found growing along riverbanks and in moist, well-drained soils. Its seeds are enclosed in woody capsules that split open to release the seeds. This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, contributing to local biodiversity and soil stabilization."
