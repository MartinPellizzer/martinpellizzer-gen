    "intro": "Centaurea montana var. sinuata, commonly known as the Sinuous Blazing Star, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking cobalt-blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are typically erect and branched. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower meadows. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
