    "intro": "Clidemia triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered mistletoe, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it attaches to the roots of other plants and draws water and nutrients from them while still performing some photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in threes, giving it its common name. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Clidemia triflora is often found in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and is an important part of the ecological interactions in its habitat."
