    "intro": "Cyclopogon iguapensis, commonly known as the Iguap\u00e9 cyclopogon, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America, specifically in the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclopogon iguapensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
