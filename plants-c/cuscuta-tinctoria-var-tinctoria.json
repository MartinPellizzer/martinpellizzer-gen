    "intro": "Cuscuta tinctoria var. tinctoria, commonly known as the red devil or dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it is often found growing on crops like beans and cotton. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years, making it a persistent weed. The plant has been historically used in traditional medicine and dye production due to its unique properties."
