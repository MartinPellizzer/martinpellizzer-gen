    "intro": "Cestichis major, commonly known as the giant rock orchid, is a striking perennial plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of large, showy flowers. The flowers are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred shape that attracts specific pollinators. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
