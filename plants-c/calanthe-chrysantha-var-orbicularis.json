    "intro": "Calanthe chrysantha var. orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, orbicular-shaped leaves and striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant prefers cool, humid environments and is often found in forest understories where it receives dappled sunlight. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in shaded garden settings."
