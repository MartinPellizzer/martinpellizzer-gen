    "intro": "Cancrinia nevskii, commonly known as the Nevskii's cancrinia, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Russian Far East. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the cold, rugged terrain of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
