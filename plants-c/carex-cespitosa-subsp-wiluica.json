    "intro": "Carex cespitosa subsp. wiluica, commonly known as the Wiluic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a cylindrical inflorescence. The plant thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The leaves are generally narrow, flat, and have a distinctive bluish-green coloration."
