    "intro": "Cyperus lanceolatus var. tener, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, clustered flower heads that are often submerged or floating in wetland environments. The plant thrives in moist soils, making it a common species in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its success in wetland ecosystems. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
