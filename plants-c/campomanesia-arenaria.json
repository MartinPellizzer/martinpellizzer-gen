    "intro": "Campomanesia arenaria, commonly known as the sand apple or beach apple, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of Brazil. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, apple-like fruits with a sweet, tangy flavor. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
