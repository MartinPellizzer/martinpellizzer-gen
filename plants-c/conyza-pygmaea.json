    "intro": "Conyza pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides, and it thrives in full sun. Its small, pale yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Conyza pygmaea is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a food source for insects and birds."
