    "intro": "Craterosiphon pseudoscandens, commonly known as the rock beard or rock tassel, is a species of green alga belonging to the family Ulvaceae. It is characterized by its filamentous growth habit and is often found in coastal areas, particularly on rocky substrates. The plant forms dense mats that can cover large surfaces, contributing to the ecological stability of its habitat. Its structure consists of a central axis with branching filaments, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Craterosiphon pseudoscandens plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for small marine organisms."
