    "intro": "Cynanchum brownianum, commonly known as the brownian milkweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. Cynanchum brownianum thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks."
