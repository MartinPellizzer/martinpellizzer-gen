    "intro": "Cnidoscolus aculeatissimus, commonly known as the \"arrow leaf\" or \"spiny begonia,\" is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and spiny margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, spiny fruits containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, its spines and toxic sap make it potentially hazardous to handle without care."
