    "intro": "Calystegia sepium var. physoides, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a variant of the morning glory family (Convolvulaceae). It is a herbaceous perennial vine characterized by its trailing growth habit and trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning. The plant produces white to pale purple blooms, which are typically 5-7 cm in diameter. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are hairy and can grow up to several meters in length. This variant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes."
