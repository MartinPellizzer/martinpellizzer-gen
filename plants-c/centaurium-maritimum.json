    "intro": "Centaurium maritimum, commonly known as sea centaury, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salty, well-drained environments. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it has a compact growth habit. Centaurium maritimum is often found in maritime climates and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils."
