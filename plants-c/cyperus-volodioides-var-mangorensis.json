    "intro": "Cyperus volodioides var. mangorensis, commonly known as the Mangrove Cyperus, is a flowering plant native to coastal and brackish wetlands in Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. The plant typically features slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It produces small, clustered inflorescences that contain tiny, three-lobed flowers, adapted for dispersal by wind or water. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
