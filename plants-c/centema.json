    "intro": "Centema, commonly known as false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped or egg-shaped, often with a hairy surface. They produce small, yellow flowers that develop into oval, bladder-like seed pods. Centema species are often found in disturbed soils and are sometimes considered weeds in agricultural settings."
