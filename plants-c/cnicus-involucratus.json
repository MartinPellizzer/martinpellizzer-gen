    "intro": "Cnicus involucratus, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Cnicus involucratus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
