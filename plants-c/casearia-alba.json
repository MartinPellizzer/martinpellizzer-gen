It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
