    "intro": "Calceolaria tripartita subsp. crenatifolia, commonly known as the Three-lobed Slipper Orchid, is a member of the Campanulaceae family. It is native to the Andes Mountains of South America, particularly in regions of Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three lobes, and the foliage is often covered in fine hairs. This species thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas at high elevations."
