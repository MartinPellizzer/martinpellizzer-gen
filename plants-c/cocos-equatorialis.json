    "intro": "Cocos equatorialis, commonly known as the East African coconut palm, is a tropical plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces a fibrous husk around its hard, white kernel, which is used for various purposes including food and fiber. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to flourish. The coconut palm plays a significant role in both ecological and economic systems in its native regions."
