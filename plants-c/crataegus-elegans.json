    "intro": "Crataegus elegans, commonly known as the silky crataegus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its flowers are white or pink and appear in early spring before the leaves. Crataegus elegans is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
