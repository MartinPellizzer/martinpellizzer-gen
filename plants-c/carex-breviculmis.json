    "intro": "Carex breviculmis, commonly known as the short-bracted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown, and it produces small, triangular berries. Carex breviculmis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
