    "intro": "Carex paniculata var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf panicled sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and have a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers in the summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers well-drained, moist soils. This variety is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps."
