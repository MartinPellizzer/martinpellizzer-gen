    "intro": "Cylindrolobus glandulifer, commonly known as the glandular cylinder lichen, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, adherent layer on rocks or bark. The thallus is typically yellowish to pale green, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It contains various secondary metabolites, including atranorin and chloroatranorin, which contribute to its chemical defense. This lichen is often found in temperate regions, growing on shaded, moist substrates."
