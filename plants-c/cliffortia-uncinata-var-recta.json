It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple. The leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on slopes or cliffs. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh, sunny conditions."
