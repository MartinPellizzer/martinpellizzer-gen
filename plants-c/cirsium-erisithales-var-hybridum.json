    "intro": "Cirsium erisithales var. hybridum, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its hybrid origin suggests genetic variation from related species within the Cirsium genus. This plant is typically found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides."
