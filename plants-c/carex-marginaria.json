    "intro": "Carex marginaria, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and a dense, compact growth habit. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of wetland ecosystems."
