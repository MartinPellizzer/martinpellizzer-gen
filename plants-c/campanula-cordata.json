    "intro": "Campanula cordata, commonly known as the heart-shaped bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are heart-shaped, hence its common name, and are typically hairy and serrated. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Campanula cordata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
