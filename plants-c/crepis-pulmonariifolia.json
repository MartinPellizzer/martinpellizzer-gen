    "intro": "Crepis pulmonariifolia, commonly known as the lungwort bellflower, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its common name reflects the leaf shape, which resembles the structure of the human lung."
