    "intro": "Cyperus papyrus var. niliacus, commonly known as the Nilotic papyrus, is a variant of the papyrus sedge native to the Nile Valley. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomes are fibrous and have been historically used for papermaking. This variety is adapted to wetland environments and thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats."
