It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of sharp, spiny leaves. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night and remain open for only one night. These flowers are followed by bright red fruits containing edible seeds. Cereus rothii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to thrive."
