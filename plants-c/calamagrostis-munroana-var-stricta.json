    "intro": "Calamagrostis munroana var. stricta, commonly known as Munro's tufted grass, is a perennial grass native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other riparian areas. Due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
