    "intro": "Cynometra hostmanniana, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
