    "intro": "Cyperus heermannii, commonly known as the desert flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in disturbed or open areas. The plant has slender, grass-like stems with small, scale-like leaves, and produces tiny, clustered spikes of pale yellow flowers. It is adapted to drought conditions and can thrive with minimal water. Cyperus heermannii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native range."
