    "intro": "Carex flava f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved yellow sedge, is a variant of the yellow sedge species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves that are typically bright yellow to green in color, giving it a striking appearance in garden settings. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This ornamental plant is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
