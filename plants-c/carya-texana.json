    "intro": "Carya texana, commonly known as the Texas hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southern United States. It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its strong, straight-grained wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by edible, sweet, chestnut-like nuts. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value in landscaping. Carya texana is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
