    "intro": "Comparettia venezuelana, commonly known as the Venezuelan bellflower, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Venezuela. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. The flowers bloom during the wet season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
