It consists of several species native to South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. The plants are shrubs or small trees with simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Cassebeera species are also valued for their potential medicinal properties."
