It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by bright orange to red, fleshy fruits. Its fruit is edible, with a sweet, honey-like flavor when fully ripe, and is often consumed by both humans and wildlife. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
