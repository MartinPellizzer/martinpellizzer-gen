    "intro": "Conocarpus supina, commonly known as the beach hibiscus, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, which are typically followed by orange or red seed pods. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Conocarpus supina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
