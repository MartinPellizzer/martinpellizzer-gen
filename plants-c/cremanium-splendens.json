It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The flowers bloom in clusters and are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their vibrant appearance."
