    "intro": "Cactus mutabilis, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and ability to produce large, fragrant white flowers at night. The plant has a columnar shape with ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its flowers open only during the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. The plant is also known for its rapid growth and resilience to drought."
