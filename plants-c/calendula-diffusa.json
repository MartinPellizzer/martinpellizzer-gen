    "intro": "Calendula diffusa, commonly known as the common marigold, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in clusters atop slender stems. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and prefers well-drained soil in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers have a distinctive, slightly fuzzy appearance. Calendula diffusa is often used in herbal remedies and as a companion plant in gardens due to its pest-repelling properties."
