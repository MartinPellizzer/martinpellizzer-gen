    "intro": "Cinchona flaccida, commonly known as the white quinine tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is notable for its historical use in the production of quinine, a compound used to treat malaria. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
