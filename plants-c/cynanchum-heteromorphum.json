    "intro": "Cynanchum heteromorphum, commonly known as the variable milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the United States. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is found in the western United States. Its leaves are alternate and have a distinctive, often lobed shape, while its flowers are clustered in umbels. Cynanchum heteromorphum plays a role in supporting local ecosystems, though it is not as well-known for its medicinal or ornamental value as other milkweed species."
