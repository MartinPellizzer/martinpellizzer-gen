    "intro": "Chelidonium majus var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy greater celandine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a thick, fleshy rhizome and erect, hairy stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height. The plant produces yellow, buttercup-like flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a waxy coating and are often covered in fine hairs. The hairy greater celandine is known for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
