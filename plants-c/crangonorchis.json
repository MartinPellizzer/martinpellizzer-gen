    "intro": "Crangonorchis, commonly known as the sea hare, is a type of marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Aplysiidae. It is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and a distinctive, often brightly colored mantle that can extend beyond the body. The plant-like appearance of some species has led to its historical classification within the plant kingdom, though it is now recognized as an invertebrate. Crangonorchis species are typically found in shallow coastal waters and are known for their ability to secrete a variety of bioactive compounds. These organisms play an important role in marine ecosystems as both prey and contributors to nutrient cycling."
