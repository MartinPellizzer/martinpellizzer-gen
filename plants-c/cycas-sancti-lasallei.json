    "intro": "Cycas sancti-lasallei, commonly known as the Lasalle's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines. This species is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common among cycads. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cycas sancti-lasallei is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
