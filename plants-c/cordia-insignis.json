    "intro": "Cordia insignis, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its woody structure and its ability to thrive in saline environments, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fleshy, red berries that contain seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cordia insignis plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
