    "intro": "Cuscuta saururi, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nourishment. It produces small, yellow flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract nutrients. The plant is often found growing on various herbaceous plants, particularly in disturbed soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through contact with the host plant. Cuscuta saururi is an annual plant that plays a role in ecological interactions but can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
