    "intro": "Cyathea barisanica, commonly known as the Barisan cycad, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a large, evergreen plant that can reach heights of up to 5 meters, characterized by its stiff, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones developing on separate plants. Cyathea barisanica is typically found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and mountainous areas. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
