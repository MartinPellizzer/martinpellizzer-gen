    "intro": "Cardamine reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed water crowfoot, is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic properties. Cardamine reflexa is also a food source for certain Lepidoptera larvae and plays a role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats."
