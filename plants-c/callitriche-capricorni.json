    "intro": "Callitriche capricorni, commonly known as the starry water star, is a small aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in shallow waters such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Callitriche capricorni plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
