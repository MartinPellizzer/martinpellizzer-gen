    "intro": "Carex dives, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and clustered, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Carex dives is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to waterlogged conditions."
