    "intro": "Ceratopteris, commonly known as water fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Ceratopteridaceae. These plants are characterized by their fronds that are often divided into small, finger-like segments called pinnae. They are typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Ceratopteris species are known for their ability to thrive in both freshwater and brackish environments. Their rapid growth and adaptability make them important components of aquatic ecosystems."
