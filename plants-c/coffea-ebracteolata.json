    "intro": "Coffea ebracteolata, commonly known as the slender coffee plant, is a species native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly Ethiopia and Somalia. It is a small shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain two seeds, which are the source of its caffeine-containing beans. It is closely related to other Coffea species but is distinguished by its unique morphology and habitat preferences."
