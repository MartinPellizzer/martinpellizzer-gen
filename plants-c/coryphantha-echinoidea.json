It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems and spiny areoles, which provide protection from herbivores. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and they bloom in the spring.
