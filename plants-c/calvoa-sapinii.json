    "intro": "Calvoa sapinii, commonly known as the Alpine snowbell, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine meadows. Due to its limited habitat, Calvoa sapinii is considered a vulnerable species."
