    "intro": "Crataegus urbana, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Crataegus urbana is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and urban areas, making it a common sight in gardens and natural landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental features make it a popular choice for landscaping."
