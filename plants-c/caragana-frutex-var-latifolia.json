    "intro": "Caragana frutex var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf shrub willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a broad base and a pointed tip, and they turn yellow in the autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in steppe or semi-arid environments."
