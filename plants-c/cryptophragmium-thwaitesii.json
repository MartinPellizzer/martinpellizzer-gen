    "intro": "Cryptophragmium thwaitesii, commonly known as the ghost lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent thallus that appears ghostly in appearance, hence its common name. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a cyanobacterium and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. It typically grows on rocks, tree bark, and soil in temperate and tropical regions. Due to its delicate structure, it is often found in shaded, moist habitats where it can absorb moisture and nutrients efficiently."
