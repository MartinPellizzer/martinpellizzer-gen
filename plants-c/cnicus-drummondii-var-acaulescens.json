    "intro": "Cnicus drummondii var. acaulescens, commonly known as Drummond's thistle, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The variety acaulescens is distinguished by its lack of a distinct stem, with the leaves forming a rosette near the ground. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. This plant plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or open landscapes."
