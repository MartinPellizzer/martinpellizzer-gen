    "intro": "Coelogyne perplexa var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain coelogyne, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The orchid's unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
