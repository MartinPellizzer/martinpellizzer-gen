    "intro": "Cheilanthes horridula f. compacta, commonly known as the compact form of the hairy rock fern, is a compact, low-growing fern species native to arid and rocky habitats in southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery, serrated fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant thrives in well-drained, limestone soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
