    "intro": "Corryocactus dillonii, commonly known as the Dillon's cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in protected areas or cultivated in botanical gardens."
