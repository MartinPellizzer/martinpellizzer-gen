    "intro": "Cynophalla verrucosa, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap, which is characteristic of the milkweed family, contains latex and can be toxic if ingested. Cynophalla verrucosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
