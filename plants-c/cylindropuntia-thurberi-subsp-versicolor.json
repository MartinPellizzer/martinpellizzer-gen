    "intro": "Cylindropuntia thurberi subsp. versicolor, commonly known as the rainbow cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often segmented and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a vibrant touch to its arid habitat. Its subspecies status reflects variations in coloration and form, particularly in the stem's hue. It is well adapted to desert environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and thriving in full sun."
