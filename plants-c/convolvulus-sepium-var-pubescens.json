    "intro": "Convolvulus sepium var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in many regions."
