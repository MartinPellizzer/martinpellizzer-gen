    "intro": "Cyclosorus subnamburensis, commonly known as the Nambura fern, is a rare and specialized aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and stream margins, where it can receive adequate light and nutrients. Its unique morphology includes a distinctive arrangement of leaflets that aid in its survival in aquatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
