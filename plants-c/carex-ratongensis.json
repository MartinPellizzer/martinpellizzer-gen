It is native to New Guinea and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or swampy areas. The plant has grass-like leaves that are often dark green and densely packed, forming a dense mat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Carex ratongensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
