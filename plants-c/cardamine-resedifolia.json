    "intro": "Cardamine resedifolia, commonly known as water shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its floating or submerged leaves that are typically divided into small, lobed segments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five sepals and petals, which are often surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, while its leaves are often coated with a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Cardamine resedifolia plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
