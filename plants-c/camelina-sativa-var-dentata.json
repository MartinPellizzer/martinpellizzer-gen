It is characterized by its distinctive serrated or toothed leaf margins, which set it apart from other varieties. This plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. The plant is valued for its oil-rich seeds, which are used in both culinary and industrial applications."
