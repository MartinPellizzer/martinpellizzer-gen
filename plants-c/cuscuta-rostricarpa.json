    "intro": "Cuscuta rostricarpa, commonly known as the rostricarpa dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks leaves, roots, and chlorophyll. It attaches itself to host plants using specialized haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on various agricultural and wild plants. It is native to regions of North America and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it can rapidly spread through infested crops."
