    "intro": "Cocos normanbyi, commonly known as the Normanby's coconut, is a rare and endangered species native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is a small palm tree that typically grows to a height of around 5 meters, with a slender trunk and feathery leaves. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single coconut-like seed, which is encased in a fibrous husk. Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its unique botanical features make it an important subject of study in tropical botany."
