    "intro": "Cyperus ovularis var. robustus, commonly known as the robust flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in wet environments. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and thrive in saturated soils."
