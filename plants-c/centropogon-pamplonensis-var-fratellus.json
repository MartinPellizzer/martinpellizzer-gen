    "intro": "Centropogon pamplonensis var. fratellus, commonly known as the Pamplona grass or Fratellus grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects in suitable climates."
