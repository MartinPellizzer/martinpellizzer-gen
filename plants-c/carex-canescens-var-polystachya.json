It belongs to the family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, spike-like clusters of flowers. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
