    "intro": "Capraria uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower capraria, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant grows as a herbaceous perennial, often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss. Capraria uniflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
