    "intro": "Cenchrus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown, and it is adapted to thrive in dry conditions. Cenchrus parviflorus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
