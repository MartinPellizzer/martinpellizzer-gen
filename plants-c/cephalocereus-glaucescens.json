    "intro": "Cephalocereus glaucescens, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure adapted to arid environments. The plant produces large, white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick stem to survive drought. The plant is popular in horticulture for its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
