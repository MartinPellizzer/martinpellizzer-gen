    "intro": "Coleus diffusus, commonly known as wild coleus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like mint and basil. The plant is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to white. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Coleus diffusus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing along streams and in forest understories."
