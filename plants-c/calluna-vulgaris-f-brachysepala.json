    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris f. brachysepala, commonly known as the dwarf heather, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the British Isles. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically a vibrant red or pink, blooming in late summer. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are dark green and arranged in a compact, mat-like form. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments. This form is a natural variant of the common heather, distinguished by its shorter flower stalks and more compact growth habit."
