It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and a long, spiraled inflorescence of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions for successful cultivation. It is listed as endangered in several states due to habitat loss and over-collection. Its unique floral structure and ecological significance make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
