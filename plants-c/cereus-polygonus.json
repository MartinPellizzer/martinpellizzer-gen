    "intro": "Cereus polygonus, commonly known as the star cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to arid environments. Cereus polygonus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
