    "intro": "Canarium smithii, commonly known as the Christmas tree or white candlewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, conical shape and glossy, dark green leaves that provide year-round foliage. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, candle-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. Its hard, heavy wood is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making. Canarium smithii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests."
