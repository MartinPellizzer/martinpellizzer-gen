    "intro": "Cheilanthes pantanalensis, commonly known as the Pantanal fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly found in the Pantanal wetland region. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are typically covered in a fine, hairy layer."
