    "intro": "Carpinus fargesiana, commonly known as the Chinese hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its leaves are typically oval to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a glossy upper surface. Carpinus fargesiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil conditions."
