    "intro": "Campanula celsii, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Campanula celsii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
