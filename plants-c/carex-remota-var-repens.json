    "intro": "Carex remota var. repens, commonly known as the wandering sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along streambanks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
