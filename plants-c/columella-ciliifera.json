    "intro": "Columella ciliifera, commonly known as the fringed columella, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, hair-like structures called cilia, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture. Columella ciliifera is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
