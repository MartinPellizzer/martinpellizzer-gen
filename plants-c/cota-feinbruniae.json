    "intro": "Cota feinbruniae, commonly known as the Feinbrunnen cota, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and often yellow or white in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
