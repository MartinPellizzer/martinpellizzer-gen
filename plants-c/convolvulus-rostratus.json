    "intro": "Convolvulus rostratus, commonly known as the rostrated bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial vine characterized by its slender stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in spring and summer. Its flowers are followed by distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Convolvulus rostratus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and can thrive in full sun."
