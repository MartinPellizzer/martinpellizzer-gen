It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by round, fleshy berries that turn from green to red as they mature. These berries are edible and have a sweet, slightly acidic flavor, making them popular in local cuisines. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
