    "intro": "Cratoxylum lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cratoxylum, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, lanceolate leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers, followed by orange or red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, lowland areas and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
