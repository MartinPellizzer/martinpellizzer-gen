    "intro": "Cardaminopsis hispida, commonly known as the hairy rock-cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant features basal leaves with a hairy texture and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its foliage is often covered in fine, glandular hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. Cardaminopsis hispida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
