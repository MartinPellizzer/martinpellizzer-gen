    "intro": "Cymbopetalum physaloides, commonly known as the balloon vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, inflated, balloon-like seed pods that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom along the stems. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a velvety texture. The balloon vine is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in warm, humid climates with adequate support for its climbing habit."
