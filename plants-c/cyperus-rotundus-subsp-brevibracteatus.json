    "intro": "Cyperus rotundus subsp. brevibracteatus, commonly known as the sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed soils. It is adapted to wet or moist environments, often found in marshy areas and along waterways."
