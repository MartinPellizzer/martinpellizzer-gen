It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and bright yellow to orange flower heads. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
