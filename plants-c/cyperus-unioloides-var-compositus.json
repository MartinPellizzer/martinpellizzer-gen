    "intro": "Cyperus unioloides var. compositus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
