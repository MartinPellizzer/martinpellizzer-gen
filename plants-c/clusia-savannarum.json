It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its often dry habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems and dense foliage. Clusia savannarum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
