    "intro": "Cyanus elbrusensis, commonly known as the Elbrus hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and dark purple disk florets, which give it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool and sunny conditions. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, and it is adapted to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils. Cyanus elbrusensis is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
