It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are segmented and store water, allowing it to survive in humid, tropical environments.
