    "intro": "Cieca riedeliana, commonly known as the Riedel's cieca, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are slender and woody. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
