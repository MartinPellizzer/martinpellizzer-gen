    "intro": "Cachrys dichotoma, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant features small, alternate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing insulation against freezing temperatures. Its flowers are clustered in racemes and are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. Cachrys dichotoma plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky and barren habitats."
