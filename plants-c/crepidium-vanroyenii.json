    "intro": "Crepidium vanroyenii, commonly known as the Van Royen's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb and thin, linear leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with three sepals and three petals, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
