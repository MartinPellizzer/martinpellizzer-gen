    "intro": "Colutea pocockii, commonly known as Pocock's colutea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds, a common trait among legumes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
