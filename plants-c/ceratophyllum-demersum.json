    "intro": "Ceratophyllum demersum, commonly known as hornwort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments across the globe. It is characterized by its branching, feather-like leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm long and have a distinctive, spiny appearance. The plant does not have true roots but instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to the substrate. It is capable of reproducing both sexually through flowers and asexually through vegetative propagation. Ceratophyllum demersum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for aquatic life."
