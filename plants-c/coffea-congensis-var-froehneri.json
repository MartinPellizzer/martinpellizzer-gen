    "intro": "Coffea congensis var. froehneri, commonly known as the Froehner's coffee, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variant of the coffee plant. It is native to the high altitudes of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where it thrives in tropical rainforest conditions. The plant produces small, red berries containing seeds that are used to make coffee. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves. Due to its limited distribution and challenging cultivation requirements, it is considered a specialty coffee variety."
