    "intro": "Crataegus crus-galli subsp. berberifolia, commonly known as the yellow hawthorn, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its yellowish flowers and small, red berries that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin and often have a yellowish or reddish hue on the underside. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader leaves and more robust growth compared to other hawthorn species."
