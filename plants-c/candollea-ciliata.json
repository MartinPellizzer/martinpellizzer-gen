    "intro": "Candollea ciliata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its roots are tuberous and can store nutrients, aiding in survival during dry periods. Candollea ciliata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands."
