It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant ecology."
