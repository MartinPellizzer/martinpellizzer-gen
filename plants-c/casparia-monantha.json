    "intro": "Casparia monantha, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with opposite, ovate leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, clustered in umbels, and attract various pollinators. The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity limits its practical applications."
