It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy, rough-textured leaves that give it its common name, and it typically grows in rocky or dry habitats. Campanula scabrida prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and borders. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
