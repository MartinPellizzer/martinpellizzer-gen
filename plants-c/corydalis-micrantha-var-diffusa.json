It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Corydalis micrantha var. diffusa is valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in woodland gardens and its early spring flowering habit."
