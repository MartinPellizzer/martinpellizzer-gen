    "intro": "Cuscuta arvensis var. pubescens, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and is often found growing on crops such as corn and soybeans. It spreads through seeds and can cause significant damage to agricultural crops. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth of its host, making it a challenging weed to control."
