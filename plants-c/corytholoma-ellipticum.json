    "intro": "Corytholoma ellipticum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its leathery, elongated thallus with a distinct upper and lower surface. The upper surface is typically dark green to blackish, while the lower surface is white to pale yellow, covered in fine, branched rhizines. It is often found on tree trunks and branches in temperate forests. This lichen plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
