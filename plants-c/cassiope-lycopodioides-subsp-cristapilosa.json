    "intro": "Cassiope lycopodioides subsp. cristapilosa, commonly known as the mountain heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor, rocky soils make it well adapted to alpine and subalpine habitats. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded areas, contributing to the unique biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
