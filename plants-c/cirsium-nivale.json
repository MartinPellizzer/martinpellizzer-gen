    "intro": "Cirsium nivale, commonly known as snowdrop thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and large, showy purple or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in a single head at the top of the stem. Cirsium nivale is an important plant for pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
