    "intro": "Celastrus mollis, commonly known as the soft twiner, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features slender, flexible stems that allow it to twine around supports, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a smooth margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary umbels, followed by orange to red berries containing several seeds. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural use in warm climates."
