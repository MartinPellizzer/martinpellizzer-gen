    "intro": "Ceradenia alboglandulosa, commonly known as the white-gland orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, white flowers with prominent yellow-green sepals and petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. The orchid's unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
