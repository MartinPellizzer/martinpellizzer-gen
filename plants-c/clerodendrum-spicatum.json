    "intro": "Clerodendrum spicatum, commonly known as the spiked clerodendrum, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Clerodendrum spicatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
