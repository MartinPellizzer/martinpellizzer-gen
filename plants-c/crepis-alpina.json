It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds. Crepis alpina is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
