    "intro": "Coriaria plumosa, commonly known as the downy coriaria, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely hairy, silver-green leaves that give it a distinctive, almost frost-covered appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural reserves."
