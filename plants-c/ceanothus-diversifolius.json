    "intro": "Ceanothus diversifolius, commonly known as the variable leaf ceanothus, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its diverse leaf shapes, ranging from lanceolate to ovate, and its clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Its leaves are typically aromatic and have a slightly fuzzy texture. Ceanothus diversifolius plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
