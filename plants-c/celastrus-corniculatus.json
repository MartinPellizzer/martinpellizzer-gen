    "intro": "Celastrus corniculatus, commonly known as the horned morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial vine that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant's scientific name reflects its distinctive horn-like calyx that encloses the flower. It thrives in moist, woodland areas and is often found climbing trees or shrubs. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, orange-colored capsule that splits open when mature."
