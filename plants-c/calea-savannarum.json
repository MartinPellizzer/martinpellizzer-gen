    "intro": "Calea savannarum, commonly known as the sacred candle plant, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking white, candle-like flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it retain moisture in its native arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Calea savannarum is also valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
