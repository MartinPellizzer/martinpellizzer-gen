    "intro": "Camelina campestris, commonly known as wild mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbages and mustards. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 100 centimeters, with alternate, pinnately lobed leaves and small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes. Its seeds are small and capsule-like, containing high levels of oil, which has been historically used for both culinary and industrial purposes. Camelina campestris is also valued for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its role in ecological restoration projects."
