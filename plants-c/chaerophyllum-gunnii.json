    "intro": "Chaerophyllum gunnii, commonly known as the alpine cow parsley, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of pinnately divided, silky-haired leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
