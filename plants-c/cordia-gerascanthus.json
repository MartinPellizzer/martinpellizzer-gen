    "intro": "Cordia gerascanthus, commonly known as the white coral tree, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats, making it an important component of Madagascar's unique flora."
