    "intro": "Cactus cochenillifer, commonly known as the cochineal cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a spineless cactus that typically grows in shrublands and rocky soils, adapting to extreme drought conditions. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water and its ability to produce a red dye from its insect inhabitants. It plays a vital role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various desert animals. Additionally, it is historically significant for its use in producing natural dyes and pigments."
