    "intro": "Cardamine amara subsp. siifolia, commonly known as the slender watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, white flowers. Native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves and stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
