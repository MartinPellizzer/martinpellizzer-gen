    "intro": "Cyperus rotundus f. comosus, commonly known as purple flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower spikes that are typically purple or reddish in color. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in wet or poorly drained soils, making it common in marshy areas and along waterways. Its rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its status as a weed in agricultural and aquatic environments. The inflorescence consists of numerous tiny, three-ranked spikelets that are often arranged in a loose, open cluster."
