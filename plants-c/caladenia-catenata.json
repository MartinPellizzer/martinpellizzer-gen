    "intro": "Caladenia catenata, commonly known as the chain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. The plant produces a single, slender flowering stem that bears a single, elongated flower with a distinctive hooded labellum. Its flowers are usually pale pink to cream in color and are pollinated by insects, particularly wasps. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens due to its unique floral structure."
