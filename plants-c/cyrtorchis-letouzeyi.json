    "intro": "Cyrtorchis letouzeyi, commonly known as the Letouzey's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow leaves that are arranged in a compact rosette, allowing it to thrive in its alpine habitat. Cyrtorchis letouzeyi is adapted to cold climates and requires well-drained, rocky soils to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental needs, it is considered an endangered species."
