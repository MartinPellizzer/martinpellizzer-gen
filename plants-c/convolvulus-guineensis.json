    "intro": "Convolvulus guineensis, commonly known as Guinea morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its heliotropic leaves that follow the sun's movement. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in the morning. It has a climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a hairy texture. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
