    "intro": "Cymbidium variegatum, commonly known as the variegated orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial orchid with a rhizome that produces a profusion of sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces upright inflorescences bearing fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor settings."
