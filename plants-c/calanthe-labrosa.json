    "intro": "Calanthe labrosa, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features a dense, grass-like foliage and produces striking, pinkish-white flower spikes that bloom in early spring. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and is often found growing in shaded, moist forest floors. Its flowers are arranged in a loose, trailing pattern, which gives it its common name. Calanthe labrosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
