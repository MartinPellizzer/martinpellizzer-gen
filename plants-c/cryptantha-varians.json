It is native to the western United States, particularly California, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, often appearing in clusters. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a compact, mat-forming growth habit. Cryptantha varians is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub ecosystems."
