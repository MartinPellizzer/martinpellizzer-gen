    "intro": "Ctenitis tenerifrons, commonly known as the Canary Islands tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and woody, providing structural support and enabling it to grow in rocky or volcanic soil. The fronds are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions, adding to its ecological and aesthetic significance."
