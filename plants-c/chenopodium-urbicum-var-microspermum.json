    "intro": "Chenopodium urbicum var. microspermum, commonly known as garden goosefoot, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in urban environments, gardens, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common weed in cultivated areas."
