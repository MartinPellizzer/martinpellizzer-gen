It features succulent, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light. Cissus brevipes is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ability to trail or climb."
