    "intro": "Cnicus eatonii, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, white or pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit with tiny, needle-like leaves that help it thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in coastal areas, dry meadows, and disturbed sites due to its tolerance for poor soil conditions. Cnicus eatonii is also known for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh environments."
