    "intro": "Colchicum bulbocodioides var. triphyllum, commonly known as the three-leaf autumn crocus, is a member of the Colchicaceae family. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in regions of Spain and Portugal. The plant produces a bulbous corm that serves as its storage organ, and it blooms in late summer or early autumn with striking violet or purple flowers. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, which is a distinguishing feature of the varietal form. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to both humans and animals."
