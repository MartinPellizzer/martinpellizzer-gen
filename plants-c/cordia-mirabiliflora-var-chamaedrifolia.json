    "intro": "Cordia mirabiliflora var. chamaedrifolia, commonly known as the creeping cordia, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are often arranged in a dense, mat-like growth habit, which helps it thrive in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to its appearance. Its fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains several seeds, aiding in its propagation. This species is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in coastal or arid environments."
