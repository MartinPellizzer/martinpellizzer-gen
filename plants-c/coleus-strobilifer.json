    "intro": "Coleus strobilifer, commonly known as the spike-leaved coleus, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage with leaves that often display vibrant shades of red, purple, and green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Coleus strobilifer is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive leaves and ease of care."
