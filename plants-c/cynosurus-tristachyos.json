    "intro": "Cynosurus tristachyos, commonly known as slender wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three- to six-flowered spikelets arranged in dense clusters. This species is typically found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and can form dense stands, often playing a role in stabilizing wetland soils. The plant is adapted to low-nutrient environments and is an important component of many wetland ecosystems."
