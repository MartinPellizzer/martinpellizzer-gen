    "intro": "Cinnamomum odoratum, commonly known as the cinnamon tree or Chinese cinnamon, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family. It is native to southern China, India, and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and bark, which contain essential oils responsible for its distinctive scent. The leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth margin and a glossy surface, while the bark is thick and fissured, often used in traditional medicine. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing berries that contain the seeds used for propagation."
