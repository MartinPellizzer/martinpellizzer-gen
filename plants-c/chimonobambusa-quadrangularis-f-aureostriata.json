It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow streaks on the culms, which contrast beautifully with its greenish-brown base. This ornamental bamboo is native to China and is prized for its aesthetic appeal in horticultural settings. The plant has a slender, upright growth habit and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
