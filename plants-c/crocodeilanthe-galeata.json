    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe galeata, commonly known as the snake fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found on the forest floor or on rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
