    "intro": "Citharexylum, commonly known as the \"harpwood\" or \"silk tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Verbenaceae. These shrubs or small trees are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The flowers are typically clustered in umbels or cymes, and the plant produces small, three-lobed fruits. Citharexylum species are often grown for their ornamental value and are used in traditional medicine in some regions."
