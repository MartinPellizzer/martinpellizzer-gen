    "intro": "Cytisus longissimus, commonly known as the long-stemmed broom, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, often spindly stems and clusters of small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, where it typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Cytisus longissimus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its role in nitrogen fixation."
