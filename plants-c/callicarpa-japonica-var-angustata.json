    "intro": "Callicarpa japonica var. angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, vibrant purple to reddish-pink berries that are a striking feature in the fall. These berries are edible for humans and animals but are not typically consumed in large quantities due to their tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
