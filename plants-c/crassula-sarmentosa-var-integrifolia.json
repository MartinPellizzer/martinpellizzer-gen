It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that grow horizontally along the ground, often forming dense mats. The leaves are thick, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, typically green with a slightly waxy texture. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months.
