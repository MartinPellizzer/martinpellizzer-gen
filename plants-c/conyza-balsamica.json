    "intro": "Conyza balsamica, commonly known as balsam weed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is an annual or biennial herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils. The plant features small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, and its leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped. It is known for its strong, often unpleasant odor, which is released when the foliage is crushed. Conyza balsamica is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
