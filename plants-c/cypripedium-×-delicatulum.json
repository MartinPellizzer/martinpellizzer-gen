    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 delicatulum, commonly known as the fragrant lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its showy, slipper-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and sometimes yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats and has a long, slender rhizome with fleshy roots. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces a single, large, pouch-like structure that serves as a nectar trap. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
