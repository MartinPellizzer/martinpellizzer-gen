    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 reghaiensis, commonly known as the Algerian rock rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Cistus \u00d7 reghaiensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
