    "intro": "Chamaenerion latifolium, commonly known as fireweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant features tall, erect stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its showy, pink to red flowers appear in clusters at the ends of the stems, blooming from late summer to early autumn. Fireweed is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often one of the first plants to colonize burned or cleared areas."
