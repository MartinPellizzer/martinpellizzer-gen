    "intro": "Cirsium occidentale var. californicum, commonly known as the California thistle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. The plant features a robust, upright stem with spiny leaves and large, showy purple or pink flower heads. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped with stiff, backward-pointing spines, which serve as a defense mechanism. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
