    "intro": "Chamaecytisus leiocarpus var. bosniacus, commonly known as the Bosnian broom, is a deciduous shrub native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features slender, arching stems that are often covered in dense, fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by pods containing small, dark seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and dry garden environments. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and long flowering period."
