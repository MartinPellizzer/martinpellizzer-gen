It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that resemble a bottlebrush, composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing the shoreline. Its flowers are typically red or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Comarostaphylis sharpii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds."
