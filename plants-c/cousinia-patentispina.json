    "intro": "Cousinia patentispina, commonly known as the broadspine globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Cousinia patentispina is a perennial species that is well adapted to drought and extreme temperature fluctuations."
