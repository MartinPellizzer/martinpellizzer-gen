    "intro": "Cnicus rivularis, commonly known as the river thistle, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows near water sources such as streams and rivers, hence its common name. The plant features a upright stem covered with spiny leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, while its flowers are arranged in a loose, open cluster. Cnicus rivularis is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to riparian habitats."
