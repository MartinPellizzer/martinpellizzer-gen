    "intro": "Cervicina hederacea, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. Cervicina hederacea is valued in both horticulture and traditional herbal medicine for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
