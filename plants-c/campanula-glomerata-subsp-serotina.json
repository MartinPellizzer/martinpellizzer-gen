    "intro": "Campanula glomerata subsp. serotina, commonly known as the late bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. The subspecies is noted for its compact growth habit and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
