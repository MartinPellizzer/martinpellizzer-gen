    "intro": "Cremaspora maxima, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing shade over water surfaces. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink, which bloom at night and emit a strong scent to attract pollinators. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in shallow waters while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment. Cremaspora maxima plays an important ecological role by supporting aquatic life and contributing to water quality through oxygenation."
