It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small, spiky globes. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are typically blue or purple in color. Chaetocarpus pearcei is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic inundation, making it a resilient species in harsh maritime conditions."
