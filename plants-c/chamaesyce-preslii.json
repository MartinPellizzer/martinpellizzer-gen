    "intro": "Chamaesyce preslii, commonly known as the Preslii sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
