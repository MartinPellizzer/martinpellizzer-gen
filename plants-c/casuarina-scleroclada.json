    "intro": "Casuarina scleroclada, commonly known as the rough casuarina, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are clustered in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, typical of the Casuarinaceae family. It is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often growing in saline environments. Its root system helps stabilize dunes and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in coastal regions."
