It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, blue-violet tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Conoclinium coelestinum is also a valuable nectar source for pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
