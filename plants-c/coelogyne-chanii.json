    "intro": "Coelogyne chanii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green flowers, which bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, aiding its survival in arid environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Coelogyne chanii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
