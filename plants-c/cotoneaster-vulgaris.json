    "intro": "Cotoneaster vulgaris, commonly known as the common cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters, featuring dense, sprawling branches and oval to elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. Its berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Cotoneaster vulgaris is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
