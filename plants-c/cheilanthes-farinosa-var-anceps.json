    "intro": "Cheilanthes farinosa var. anceps, commonly known as the rock spurge or desert shield fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and leathery, spore-bearing fronds. The plant thrives in rocky crevices and well-drained soils, demonstrating remarkable drought tolerance. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
