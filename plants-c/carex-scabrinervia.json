    "intro": "Carex scabrinervia, commonly known as the rough-veined sedge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces three-sided, three-angled fruits. Carex scabrinervia is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
