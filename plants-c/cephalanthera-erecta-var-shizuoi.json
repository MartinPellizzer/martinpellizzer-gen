    "intro": "Cephalanthera erecta var. shizuoi, commonly known as the Shizuoka lady's tresses, is a rare and striking orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that resemble a truss of small bells. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
