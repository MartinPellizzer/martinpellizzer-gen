    "intro": "Cerastium scaranii, commonly known as the rock chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, sunny soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its compact growth habit and ability to colonize rocky substrates make it a common sight in mountainous landscapes. Cerastium scaranii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native habitats."
