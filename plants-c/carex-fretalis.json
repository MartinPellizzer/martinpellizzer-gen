    "intro": "Carex fretalis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a triangular cross-section, a characteristic feature of sedges. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, three-ranked flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. Carex fretalis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
