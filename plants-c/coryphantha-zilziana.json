    "intro": "Coryphantha zilziana, commonly known as the Zilz's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 15 centimeters. The plant features a cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure and produces yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and relying on minimal rainfall for survival. Coryphantha zilziana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
