    "intro": "Cirsium hydrophilum var. vaseyi, commonly known as the water thistle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist environments, including wet meadows and stream banks, and is often found in areas with rich, loamy soil. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
