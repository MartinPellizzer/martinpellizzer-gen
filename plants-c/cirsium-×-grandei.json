    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 grandei, commonly known as the New Zealand thistle, is a hybrid plant species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with coarse teeth and a distinctive, waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions outside its native range."
