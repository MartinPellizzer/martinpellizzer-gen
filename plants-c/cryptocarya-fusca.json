    "intro": "Cryptocarya fusca, commonly known as the New Zealand native tree or mountain pepper, is a member of the Lauraceae family. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in forested areas, often in the upper canopy, and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces dark, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds. Cryptocarya fusca plays a significant ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
