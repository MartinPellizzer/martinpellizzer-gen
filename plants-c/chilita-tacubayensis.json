    "intro": "Chilita tacubayensis, commonly known as the Tacubaya chilita, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chilita tacubayensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
