    "intro": "Ceratoschoenus macrostachys var. inundatus, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Ceratoschoenus, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that provide shade and habitat for aquatic life. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the day. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread across water surfaces, forming dense mats. The leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss and supports its aquatic lifestyle."
