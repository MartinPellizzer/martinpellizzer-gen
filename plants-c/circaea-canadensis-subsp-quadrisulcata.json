    "intro": "Circaea canadensis subsp. quadrisulcata, commonly known as the four-ribbed wintergreen, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, four-ribbed leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense umbels. Its stems are typically prostrate or ascending, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils in woodland habitats. The species is notable for its aromatic foliage and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
