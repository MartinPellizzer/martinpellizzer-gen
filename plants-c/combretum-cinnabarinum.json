    "intro": "Combretum cinnabarinum, commonly known as red flame bush, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Combretum cinnabarinum is often used in ornamental gardening due to its vibrant color and drought tolerance."
