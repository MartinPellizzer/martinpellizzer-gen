    "intro": "Cuscuta pacifica var. pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to western North America and is often found on species such as willows and poplars. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can form dense infestations on its host plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host if left unchecked."
