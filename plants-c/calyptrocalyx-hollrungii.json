    "intro": "Calyptrocalyx hollrungii, commonly known as the hollrung's calyptrocalyx, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive floral structure. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, with a unique calyx that remains tightly closed until the flower opens. Its foliage consists of palmate leaves, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
