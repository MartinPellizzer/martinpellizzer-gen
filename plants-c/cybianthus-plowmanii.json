    "intro": "Cybianthus plowmanii, commonly known as the Prowman\u2019s cybianthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
