    "intro": "Coelogyne stachyodes, commonly known as the dark-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and long, slender stems that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near the forest floor or on tree trunks. Its flowers are notable for their intricate structure and subtle fragrance, which attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. Coelogyne stachyodes is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in traditional herbal medicine."
