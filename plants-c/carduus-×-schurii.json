    "intro": "Carduus \u00d7 schurii, commonly known as the Schur's thistle, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Carduus nutans (goatweed) and Carduus marianus (greater centaury). It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Due to its prickly nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
