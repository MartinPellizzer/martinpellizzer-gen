It features slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking, cobalt-blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
