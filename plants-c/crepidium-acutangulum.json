    "intro": "Crepidium acutangulum, commonly known as the sharp-angled orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forest floors and mountainous regions. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
