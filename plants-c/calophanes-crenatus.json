    "intro": "Calophanes crenatus, commonly known as the jagged leaf cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and its distinctive, pinnately compound leaves with a serrated or jagged margin. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their unique appearance. Calophanes crenatus is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil."
