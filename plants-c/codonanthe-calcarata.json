    "intro": "Codonanthe calcarata, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, temperate climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, seed-like fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
