    "intro": "Ceuthocarpus involucratus var. moaensis, commonly known as the Moa's ghost tree, is a unique member of the Rhamnaceae family. It is a small, deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, woody fruits that split open to release its seeds. It is native to New Zealand and is notable for its association with the extinct moa birds. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
