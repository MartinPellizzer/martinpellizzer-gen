    "intro": "Cypripedium insigne var. biflorum, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a unique adaptation for attracting specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, and it produces a single or double flower per stem, depending on the variety. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered an important species in botanical conservation efforts."
