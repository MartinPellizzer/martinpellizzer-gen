    "intro": "Cyperus antillanus, commonly known as the swamp spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has cylindrical, grass-like stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Cyperus antillanus plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
