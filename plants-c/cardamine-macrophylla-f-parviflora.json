    "intro": "Cardamine macrophylla f. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. It plays a role in supporting aquatic insect populations and is often found in ponds, streams, and wet meadows."
