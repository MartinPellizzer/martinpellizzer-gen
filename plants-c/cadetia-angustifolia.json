    "intro": "Cadetia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically features slender, upright stems that bear small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale pink. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
