    "intro": "[WRONG START] Corothamnus adpressae pilosus, commonly known as the dense-hairy buckthorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense covering of fine, grayish hairs on its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, dark berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Corothamnus adpressae pilosus is well-suited to rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant in desert ecosystems."
