    "intro": "Clidemia quintuplinervia, commonly known as the five-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and typically grows on the branches of trees, drawing water and nutrients from its host. The plant has small, opposite leaves with five distinct veins, giving it its scientific name. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees, facilitating its spread."
