It is an annual herb with a sprawling growth habit, featuring succulent, fleshy leaves that are edible and rich in nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry conditions. Chenopodium arizonicum is often used in traditional cuisine and has been studied for its potential nutritional and medicinal benefits."
