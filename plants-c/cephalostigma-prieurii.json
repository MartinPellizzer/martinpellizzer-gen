    "intro": "Cephalostigma prieurii, commonly known as the African snowbell, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a short, stocky stem with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Its flowers are typically clustered in umbels, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
