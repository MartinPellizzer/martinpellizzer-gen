    "intro": "Catha acuminata, commonly known as khat, is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, green, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant contains psychoactive compounds, primarily cathinone and cathine, which are responsible for its stimulating effects. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Its botanical classification places it in the family Cucurbitaceae, though it is often grouped with other Euphorbiaceae species due to its morphological similarities."
