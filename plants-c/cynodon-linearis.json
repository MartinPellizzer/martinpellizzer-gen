    "intro": "Cynodon linearis, commonly known as the common bermudagrass, is a perennial grass native to warm climates. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically 2 to 4 inches long and have a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for lawns and pastures. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and form dense turf."
