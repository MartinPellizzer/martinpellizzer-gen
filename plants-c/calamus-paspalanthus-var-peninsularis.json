It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often leafless above the base, with narrow, grass-like leaves near the base. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. This variant is adapted to withstand drought and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
