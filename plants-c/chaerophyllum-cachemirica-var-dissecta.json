It features a rosette of basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often feather-like, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in an umbel, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ornamental species in its native environment."
