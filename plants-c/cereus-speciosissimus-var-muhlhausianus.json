    "intro": "Cereus speciosissimus var. muhlhausianus, commonly known as the Muhlenberg's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are ribbed and covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white and pink. These flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night before wilting. It is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and striking appearance."
