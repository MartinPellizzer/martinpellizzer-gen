    "intro": "Clevelandia beldingii, commonly known as the Belding's clevelandia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle beauty to its natural habitat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
