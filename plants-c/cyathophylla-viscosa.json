    "intro": "Cyathophylla viscosa, commonly known as the sticky cyathophylla, is a member of the family Cyathophyllaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. The plant is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are small and clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, which is a distinctive feature of the genus. The sticky secretions on its leaves also serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
