    "intro": "Candollea crossocephala, commonly known as the helmet fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped spore cases. The plant has fronds that are typically divided into segments, with a serrated or lobed appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. The spores are released from the specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in the terminal portion of the fronds."
