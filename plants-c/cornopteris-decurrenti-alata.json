    "intro": "Cornopteris decurrenti-alata, commonly known as the decurrent-alate wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The leaves are usually deciduous, with a distinctive decurrent (gradually tapering) shape and a finely divided, almost feather-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the fern life cycle."
