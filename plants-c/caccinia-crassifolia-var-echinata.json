It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environmental conditions."
