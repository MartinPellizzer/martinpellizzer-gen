It belongs to the Celastraceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by orange or red berries containing seeds. Its roots and stems are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
