    "intro": "Cheirostylis tairae, commonly known as the Tairae's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of a few showy, spurred flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
