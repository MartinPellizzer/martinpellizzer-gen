    "intro": "Claytonia portulacaria, commonly known as the mouse ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces tiny, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, appearing in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Claytonia portulacaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to support local pollinators."
