    "intro": "Cereus ianthothele, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, nocturnal flowers that open only at night, emitting a sweet fragrance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. The ghost flower is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal rainfall."
