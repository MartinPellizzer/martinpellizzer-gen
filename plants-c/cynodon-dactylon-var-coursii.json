    "intro": "Cynodon dactylon var. coursii, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and its ability to thrive in hot, dry climates. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often used in landscaping and for erosion control. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and form a dense turf."
