    "intro": "Cestrum dubium, commonly known as the night-blooming coffee plant, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slight pubescence. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds, and it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming habit."
