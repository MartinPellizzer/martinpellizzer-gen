    "intro": "Cephalantheropsis halconensis, commonly known as the Halconensis Ghost Orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to specific regions of Central America. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale green to white flowers that resemble spectral forms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its botanical features include slender, wiry stems and showy, fragrant blossoms that bloom during the late spring or early summer. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
