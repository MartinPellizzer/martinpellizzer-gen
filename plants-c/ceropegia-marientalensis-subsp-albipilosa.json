The plant has fleshy, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small, tubular, and typically white or pale pink, with a unique structure that attracts specific pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
