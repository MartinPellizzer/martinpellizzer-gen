    "intro": "Croton betulaster, commonly known as the silverleaf croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often elliptical leaves that are usually gray-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
