    "intro": "Cirsium gadukense, commonly known as the Gadukense thistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and other thistle species. The plant is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple or pink flower heads, which consist of numerous small florets. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
