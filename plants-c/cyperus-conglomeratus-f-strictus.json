    "intro": "Cyperus conglomeratus f. strictus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikes that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is distinguished by its more compact and upright growth habit compared to other forms of Cyperus conglomeratus."
