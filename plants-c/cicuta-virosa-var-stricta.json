    "intro": "Cicuta virosa var. stricta, commonly known as water hemlock, is a toxic plant belonging to the parsley family (Apiaceae). It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that resemble those of poison hemlock. The plant contains potent toxic compounds, primarily cicutoxin, which can cause severe poisoning in humans and animals. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and wetlands. Due to its high toxicity, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
