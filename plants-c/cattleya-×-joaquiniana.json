    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 joaquiniana, commonly known as the Joaquiniana orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink, often with intricate patterns and a distinctive lip. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation and moderate temperatures. Its foliage consists of broad, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat."
