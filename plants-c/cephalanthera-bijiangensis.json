    "intro": "Cephalanthera bijiangensis, commonly known as the Bijiang orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of China, particularly in Yunnan Province, where it thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow with intricate patterns, and it lacks chlorophyll, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
