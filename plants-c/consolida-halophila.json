    "intro": "Consolida halophila, commonly known as the saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its small, yellow or orange flowers and hairy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss. This species is adapted to grow in soils with high salinity, making it a valuable plant for reclaiming degraded land. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, enhancing its drought tolerance. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing coastal and desert soils while providing nectar for pollinators."
