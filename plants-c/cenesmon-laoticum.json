    "intro": "Cenesmon laoticum, commonly known as the Laotian cenesmon, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Laos and parts of Vietnam. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Cenesmon laoticum is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
