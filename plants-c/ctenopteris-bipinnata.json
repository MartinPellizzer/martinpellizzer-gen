    "intro": "Ctenopteris bipinnata, commonly known as the double-pinnate sea fern, is a species of marine fern belonging to the family Cystothecaceae. It is characterized by its feather-like fronds that are divided into two sets of pinnae, giving it a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant thrives in coastal environments, often found in intertidal zones where it attaches to rocky substrates. Its rhizomes are adapted to withstand tidal forces and provide structural support. Ctenopteris bipinnata plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and serves as habitat for various marine organisms."
