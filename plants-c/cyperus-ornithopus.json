    "intro": "Cyperus ornithopus, commonly known as the bird's beak sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Cyperus ornithopus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
