    "intro": "Campanula robertsonii, commonly known as Robertson's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its stems are upright and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
