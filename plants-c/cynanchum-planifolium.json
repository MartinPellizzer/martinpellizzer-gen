    "intro": "Cynanchum planifolium, commonly known as the flat-leaf dogbane, is a perennial herb native to regions of Asia, including China and Russia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves with smooth margins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
