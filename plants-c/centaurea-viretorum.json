    "intro": "Centaurea viretorum, commonly known as the yellow star-thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
