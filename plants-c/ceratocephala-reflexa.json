It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, horn-shaped seed pods that reflex outward, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Ceratocephala reflexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
