    "intro": "Calamus parvifructus, commonly known as the small-fruited calamus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in wet, tropical environments and is often found in swampy or marshy areas. Due to its unique morphology and ecological preferences, it plays a role in the wetland ecosystems of its native range."
