It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant's fruit is a small, round, and typically red or yellow berry with a thick, leathery skin. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly waxy texture. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and is also used in ornamental horticulture."
