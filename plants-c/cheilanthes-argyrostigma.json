    "intro": "Cheilanthes argyrostigma, commonly known as the silver-stained rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with thick, water-storing leaves and a shallow root system. This fern is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in crevices, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil."
