    "intro": "Calamagrostis canadensis var. imberbis, commonly known as the Canadian feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray foliage and delicate, feathery plumes that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. It is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ecological benefits and ornamental appeal."
