    "intro": "Catasetum sanguineum, commonly known as the blood orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers, which often have a striking contrast with its green foliage. The plant produces a unique structure called a \"catasetum,\" which is a specialized pollination mechanism. Its flowers are typically borne on elongated stems and emit a subtle fragrance to attract pollinators. Catasetum sanguineum thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
