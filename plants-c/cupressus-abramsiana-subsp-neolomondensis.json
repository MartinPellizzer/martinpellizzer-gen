    "intro": "Cupressus abramsiana subsp. neolomondensis, commonly known as the Neolomond cedar, is a rare and endangered subspecies native to the southwestern United States. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its scale-like leaves and distinctive, rounded cones. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and has a slow growth rate, making it particularly vulnerable to environmental changes. Its botanical features include a straight trunk with a conical crown, and it produces aromatic, woody foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
