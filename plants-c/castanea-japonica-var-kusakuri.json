It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, spiny husks that encase its edible, sweet chestnuts, typically harvested in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible yield."
