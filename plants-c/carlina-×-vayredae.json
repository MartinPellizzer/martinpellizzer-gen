    "intro": "Carlina \u00d7 vayredae, commonly known as the hybrid ragwort, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and a robust root system, which helps it thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
