    "intro": "Cereus brittonianus, commonly known as the Britton's cactus, is a species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, unbranched stem that can grow up to 10 feet in height. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its stems are covered in sparse, white spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. The plant is often cultivated for its striking appearance and resilience in dry climates."
