    "intro": "Cenchrus arnhemicus, commonly known as the desert grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to colonize disturbed soils and stabilize sandy or rocky landscapes. Cenchrus arnhemicus plays an important role in preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
