    "intro": "Coccocypselum brownei, commonly known as the Brown's coccocypselum, is a small, shrub-like plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, though it is not closely related to them. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruit is a dry, indehiscent capsule that contains several seeds. It is often found in moist, tropical environments and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
