It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is closely related to the coffee genus Coffea. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers. Its fruit, which resembles a coffee cherry, contains seeds that are used for coffee production. However, it is less commonly cultivated than other coffee species due to its specific growing requirements."
