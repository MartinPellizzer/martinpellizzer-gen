    "intro": "Conostegia holosericea, commonly known as the silky balsa, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its lightweight wood, it has been historically used for model building and other lightweight applications."
