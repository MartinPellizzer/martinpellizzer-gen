    "intro": "Cheilanthes californica, commonly known as the California rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in dry, sunny environments. The plant has small, leathery, evergreen leaves that remain throughout the year, contributing to its drought tolerance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is well adapted to arid conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native habitat."
