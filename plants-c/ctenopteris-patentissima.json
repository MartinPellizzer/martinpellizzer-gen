    "intro": "Ctenopteris patentissima, commonly known as the broad-leaf sea palm, is a species of fern native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, saline environments, often found in mangrove forests and tidal zones. Its fronds are covered in small, scale-like structures that help reduce water loss and protect against salt spray. Ctenopteris patentissima plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
