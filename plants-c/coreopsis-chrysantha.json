    "intro": "Coreopsis chrysantha, commonly known as the yellow coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils. It is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides. Coreopsis chrysantha is valued for its ornamental value and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
