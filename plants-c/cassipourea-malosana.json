It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by round, red or orange fruits that resemble apples. Cassipourea malosana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a street tree. Its fruit is edible but not as widely consumed as other apples, though it is used in some local cuisines."
