    "intro": "Cyphostemma urophyllum, commonly known as the rock fig or desert fig, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible fruits resembling figs. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in dry, shrubland habitats. Cyphostemma urophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions."
