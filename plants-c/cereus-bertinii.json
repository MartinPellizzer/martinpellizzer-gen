    "intro": "Cereus bertinii, commonly known as the Christmas star cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of bright, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom during the holiday season. The plant has a branching structure with areoles, which are specialized structures that produce spines, flowers, and sometimes branches. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many cacti. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
