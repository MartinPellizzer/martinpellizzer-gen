    "intro": "Ceanothus lancifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ceanothus, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant blue or violet flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats. Ceanothus lancifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
