It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, orange-yellow berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
