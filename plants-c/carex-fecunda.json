    "intro": "Carex fecunda, commonly known as the common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets of flowers. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense stands. Its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms makes it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems."
