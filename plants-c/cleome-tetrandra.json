    "intro": "Cleome tetrandra, commonly known as spider flower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant produces four stamens in each flower, which is a distinctive botanical feature. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in gardens. Cleome tetrandra is an annual plant that blooms from summer to early fall, adding ornamental value with its delicate, spider-like blooms."
