    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris subf. recta, commonly known as the upright heather, is a subshrub native to the British Isles and parts of western Europe. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. It produces small, dark purple berries that are an important food source for birds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting biodiversity."
