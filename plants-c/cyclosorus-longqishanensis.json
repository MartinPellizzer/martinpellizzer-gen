    "intro": "Cyclosorus longqishanensis, commonly known as the Longqishan cyclosorus, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an important species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
