    "intro": "Calyptracordia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed calyptracordia, is a unique flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive, often hairy foliage. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are broadly rounded, giving it the common name, and it thrives in moist, tropical environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
