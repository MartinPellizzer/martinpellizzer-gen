    "intro": "Cytisus leucanthus var. obscurus, commonly known as the dark-flowered broom, is a shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It features slender, often spiny stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
