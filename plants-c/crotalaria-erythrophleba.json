    "intro": "Crotalaria erythrophleba, commonly known as the red-flowered crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, featuring compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces vibrant red or orange-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny pod, which splits open when mature to release the seeds. Crotalaria erythrophleba is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects."
