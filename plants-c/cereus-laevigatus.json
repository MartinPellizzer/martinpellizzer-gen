It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is often cultivated for its striking white flowers that open at night. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its flowers are typically fragrant and can last for several days. Cereus laevigatus is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
