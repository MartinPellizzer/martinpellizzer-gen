    "intro": "Cynoglottis serpentinicola, commonly known as serpent rock tansy, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, acidic soils found in serpentine rock formations. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and narrow, linear leaves. The plant exhibits a unique ability to tolerate heavy metals in the soil, which is a common feature of serpentine habitats. It is typically found in rocky, exposed areas and has a limited geographic distribution. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered an indicator species for serpentine ecosystems."
