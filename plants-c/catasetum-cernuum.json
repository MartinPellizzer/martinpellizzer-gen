    "intro": "Catasetum cernuum, commonly known as the hanging cat slip, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy flowers that hang from the stem, often in clusters. The plant produces a distinctive, elongated spur at the base of each flower, which is a feature common among orchids in the Catasetum genus. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange with darker markings, and it blooms during the dry season. The plant prefers warm, humid environments and is often found in forest understories."
