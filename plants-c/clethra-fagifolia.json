    "intro": "Clethra fagifolia, commonly known as the white alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces fragrant, white, clustered flowers in late summer, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. Clethra fagifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
