    "intro": "Cheiranthus subulatus, commonly known as the needle-leaved whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar floral structures. Cheiranthus subulatus is often found in disturbed soils and can be a pioneer species in ecological succession."
