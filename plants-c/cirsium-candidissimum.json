    "intro": "Cirsium candidissimum, commonly known as the white cockle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its flowering heads consist of many small florets arranged in a composite structure typical of the daisy family. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can colonize areas after fires or other disturbances."
