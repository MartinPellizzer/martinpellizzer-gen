It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant with succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils and arid environments. Cnicus tolucanus is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields."
