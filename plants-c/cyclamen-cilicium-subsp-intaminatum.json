    "intro": "Cyclamen cilicium subsp. intaminatum, commonly known as the Armenian cyclamen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It features heart-shaped, velvety foliage and produces striking, spurred flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland and shaded rock crevices. Its tuberous roots allow it to survive periods of dormancy, making it well-adapted to its native habitat. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with partial shade."
