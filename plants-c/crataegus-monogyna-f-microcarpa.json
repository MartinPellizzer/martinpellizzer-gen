    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna f. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited hawthorn, is a compact shrub or small tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The flowers are white or pink, appearing in clusters, and the fruit is a small, red berry that ripens in late summer. This form is distinguished by its smaller fruits compared to the typical species, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, though it can tolerate partial shade."
