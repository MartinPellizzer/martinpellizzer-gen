    "intro": "Calamagrostis mauritanica, commonly known as the Spanish needle or silver reed, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that are often white or pale green, which appear in late summer to early autumn. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and along roadsides. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in arid climates."
