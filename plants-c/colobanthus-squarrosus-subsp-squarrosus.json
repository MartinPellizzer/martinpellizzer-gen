    "intro": "Colobanthus squarrosus subsp. squarrosus, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in extreme cold and high UV radiation. This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its native range."
