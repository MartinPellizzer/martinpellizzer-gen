    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. subherbaceum, commonly known as creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval, hairy, and often covered in fine, white pubescence. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along paths, and in gardens."
