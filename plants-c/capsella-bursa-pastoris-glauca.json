    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris glauca, commonly known as the common groundsel, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
