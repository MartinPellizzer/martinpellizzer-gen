    "intro": "Caladenia transitoria, commonly known as the transient spider-orchid, is a species of orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. The plant produces a single, slender stem bearing a single, highly fragrant orchid flower with a distinctive spider-like appearance. Its blooming period occurs during the late winter to early spring, and it is known for its ephemeral nature, as the flower often fades quickly. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
