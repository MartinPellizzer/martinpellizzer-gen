    "intro": "Cyperus dubius var. macrocephalus, commonly known as the broad-headed flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like stems that often grow in wet or marshy environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture, and it has a fibrous root system. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
