    "intro": "Cynanchum absconditum, commonly known as the hidden milkweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for undisturbed ecosystems."
