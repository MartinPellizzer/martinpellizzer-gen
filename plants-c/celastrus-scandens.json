    "intro": "Celastrus scandens, commonly known as American gooseberry, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features opposite, elliptic leaves that are usually dark green and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by orange to red berries that are edible but often tart. Its stems are woody and can climb by twining around supports, making it a common sight in woodlands and along fences. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
