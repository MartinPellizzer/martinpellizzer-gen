    "intro": "Carex morrowii, commonly known as Morrow's sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. Carex morrowii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
