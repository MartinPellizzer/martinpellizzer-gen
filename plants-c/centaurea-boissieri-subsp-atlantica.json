    "intro": "Centaurea boissieri subsp. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in coastal areas of southern Europe and North Africa. It is a perennial herb with slender, upright stems and bright blue to violet flowers that bloom from summer to autumn. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, bristly seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to rocky or sandy coastal habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
