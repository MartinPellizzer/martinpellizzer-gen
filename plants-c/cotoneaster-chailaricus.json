    "intro": "Cotoneaster chailaricus, commonly known as the Himalayan cotoneaster, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It typically grows at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 4,000 meters, thriving in temperate and alpine climates. The plant features small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence, and it produces clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring. Its berries, which are red when mature, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Cotoneaster chailaricus is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture for its hardy nature and seasonal interest."
