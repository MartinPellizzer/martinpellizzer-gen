    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris frigida, commonly known as common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces clusters of white flowers with five petals. The plant typically blooms from late spring to early summer and is often found in disturbed soils, along pathways, and in gardens. It has a fibrous root system and spreads through both seeds and vegetative growth. Its common name derives from the shape of its seed pods, which resemble a shepherd\u2019s pouch."
