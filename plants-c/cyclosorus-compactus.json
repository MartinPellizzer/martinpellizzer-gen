    "intro": "Cyclosorus compactus, commonly known as the small water fern, is a small aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and streams. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with finely divided, feather-like fronds. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. Cyclosorus compactus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through its biological activity."
