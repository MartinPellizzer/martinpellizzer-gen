    "intro": "Callianthe laxa, commonly known as the slender sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils near the shore, often in brackish or saltwater environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Callianthe laxa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small marine and terrestrial organisms."
