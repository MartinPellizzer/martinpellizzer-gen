    "intro": "Cousinia kataghanica, commonly known as the Kataghan cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, silver-gray leaves that form a cushion-like structure. The plant produces yellow flowers in the summer, which are typically clustered in a composite head. It is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Cousinia kataghanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing soil in its native range."
