These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to salty, sandy soils. They have distinctive blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, and their leaves are often covered in fine hairs. Crepidopsis species are often used in coastal landscaping due to their hardiness and ornamental value. The plants are also known for their ability to thrive in harsh maritime environments."
