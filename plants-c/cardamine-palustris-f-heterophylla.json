    "intro": "Cardamine palustris f. heterophylla, commonly known as the bog watercress, is a variant of the narrow-leaf watercress. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. The plant features alternate, lanceolate leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small white or greenish flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to wetland ecosystems and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
