    "intro": "Convolvulus asclepiadeus, commonly known as the Crown Vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the bindweed family (Convolvulaceae) and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often used in erosion control due to its vigorous growth and deep root system. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
