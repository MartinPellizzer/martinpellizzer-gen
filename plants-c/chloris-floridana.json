    "intro": "Chloris floridana, commonly known as Florida grass or Florida bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and small, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Chloris floridana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
