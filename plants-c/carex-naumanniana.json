It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green hue, while its inflorescence consists of spike-like clusters of small, three-ranked flowers.
