    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 littleanum, commonly known as the Little Anemone Orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers with a distinctive green lip, which is a notable botanical feature. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, preferring rich, organic soil. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces a single, showy bloom each year. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
