It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and distinctive, often divided leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Its botanical features make it an important species in wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
