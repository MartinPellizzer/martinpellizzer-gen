    "intro": "Cereus titan, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cereus, is a striking cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 15 feet in height. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night and last only a single evening. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The botanical name reflects its impressive size and unique blooming habits."
