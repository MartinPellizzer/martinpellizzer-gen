    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. subumbellata, commonly known as the hairy watercress, is a perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It features trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in damp habitats. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in an umbellate cluster, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in wet soils along stream banks and marshes. This variant is distinguished by its slightly smaller and more compact inflorescence compared to the typical form of Cardamine hirsuta."
