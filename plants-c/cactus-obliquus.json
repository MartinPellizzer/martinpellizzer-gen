    "intro": "Cactus obliquus, commonly known as the zigzag cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, angular stems that form a zigzag pattern, which helps reduce water loss by minimizing surface area exposed to the sun. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its desert habitat. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing transpiration. Cactus obliquus is well adapted to survive in extreme conditions with minimal water, making it a resilient member of desert ecosystems."
