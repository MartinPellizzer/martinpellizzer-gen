It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and the presence of white, tubular flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces bright red, fleshy fruits that are edible and contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and indoor cultivation."
