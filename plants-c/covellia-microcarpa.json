    "intro": "Covellia microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited Covellia, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that are clustered in dense umbels, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a mild, spicy scent when crushed. Covellia microcarpa is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
