    "intro": "Calopogon, commonly known as the grass pink, is a rare and delicate member of the orchid family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in wet, acidic soils in swampy or marshy habitats. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small, clustered flowers that are pollinated by insects. Due to habitat loss, Calopogon is considered endangered in many areas, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
