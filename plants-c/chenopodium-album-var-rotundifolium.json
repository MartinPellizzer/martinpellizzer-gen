    "intro": "Chenopodium album var. rotundifolium, commonly known as broadleaf lambsquarters, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as bloom. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by dry, three-angled seed capsules. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. This variant is distinguishable from other chenopodium species by its larger, more rounded foliage."
