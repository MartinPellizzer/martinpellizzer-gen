    "intro": "Chaerophyllum grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered cow parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and compound umbels. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features a stout, hairy stem with basal leaves that are pinnately divided, and its flowers are white or pale yellow, appearing in umbrella-like clusters. It is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, contributing to the biodiversity of these habitats. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used traditionally for its calming and digestive effects."
