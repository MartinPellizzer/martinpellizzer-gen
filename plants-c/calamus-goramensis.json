    "intro": "Calamus goramensis, commonly known as the Goramensis canes, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically arranged in panicles, and it relies on wind pollination. Due to habitat loss, Calamus goramensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
