    "intro": "Celastrus aculeatus var. oblanceifolius, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed staff-vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of several meters, allowing it to climb trees and other structures. The leaves are typically oblong to elliptic in shape, with a smooth texture and a pointed tip. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by woody, berry-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
