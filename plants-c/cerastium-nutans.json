    "intro": "Cerastium nutans, commonly known as the leaning chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often curve downward, giving it a unique, cascading appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its delicate, frost-tender nature. Cerastium nutans thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
