    "intro": "Chilochloa hispida, commonly known as the rough chilochloa, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and rough, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and streamside areas. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike with small, spikelet-like flowers. Chilochloa hispida plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
