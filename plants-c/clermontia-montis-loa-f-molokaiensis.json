    "intro": "Clermontia montis-loa f. molokaiensis, commonly known as the Molokai lady's-tresses, is a rare orchid endemic to the island of Molokai in Hawaii. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in dense, loose clusters along the stems. The plant grows in shaded, moist habitats, typically in forest understories or on rocky slopes. It has lance-shaped leaves and a rhizomatous root system, which helps it survive in its native environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
