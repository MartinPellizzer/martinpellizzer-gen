    "intro": "Cissus trigona, commonly known as the rock fig or stone plant, is a climbing vine native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its succulent, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically consumed by birds and other animals. Its ability to grow on rocky surfaces makes it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Cissus trigona is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
