    "intro": "Coulteria chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean coulteria, is a flowering plant native to South America, specifically Chile. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native habitat."
