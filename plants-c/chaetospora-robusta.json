The plant exhibits a thallus that is typically crustose or foliose in structure. It is characterized by its dense, sponge-like growth form and the presence of specialized structures called cephalodia. Chaetospora robusta is often found on rocky surfaces in humid environments, contributing to soil stabilization and nutrient cycling."
