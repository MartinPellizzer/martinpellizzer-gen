    "intro": "Carex nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra marsh sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It has fibrous roots and forms clumps, often forming dense vegetation that helps stabilize soil. Carex nevadensis is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
