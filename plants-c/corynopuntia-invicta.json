    "intro": "Corynopuntia invicta, commonly known as the \"devil's backbone,\" is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and adapting to harsh desert conditions. Corynopuntia invicta is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
