    "intro": "Cattleya maxima var. aphlebia, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can range in color from white to pink, red, and purple, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in conditions with seasonal dry periods. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and fragrance."
