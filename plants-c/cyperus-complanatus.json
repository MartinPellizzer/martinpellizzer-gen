    "intro": "Cyperus complanatus, commonly known as spiny flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and pond edges. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common wetland plant. Cyperus complanatus is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed or aquatic environments."
