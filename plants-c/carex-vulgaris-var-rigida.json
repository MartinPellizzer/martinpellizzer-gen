    "intro": "Carex vulgaris var. rigida, commonly known as rigid marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its stiff, upright flowering stems that bear small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in three rows, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Carex vulgaris var. rigida plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
