    "intro": "Casuarina dumosa, commonly known as the coastal casuarina, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are clustered in spirals around the stems. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Casuarina dumosa thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes. Its ability to tolerate salt and drought makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
