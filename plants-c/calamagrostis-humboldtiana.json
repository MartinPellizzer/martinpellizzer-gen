It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often silver-white in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and riverbanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water garden and pond-side landscaping."
