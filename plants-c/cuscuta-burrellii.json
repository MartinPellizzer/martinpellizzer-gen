    "intro": "Cuscuta burrellii, commonly known as the Burrell's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow or green flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, adhesive hairs that help it cling to its host. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on a variety of herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and then establishing a connection with the host's vascular system. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation."
