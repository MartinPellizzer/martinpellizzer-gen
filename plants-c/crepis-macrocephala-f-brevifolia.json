    "intro": "Crepis macrocephala f. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved mouse-ear chickweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically shorter than those of the species. The plant produces fluffy, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in small heads, typical of the tribe Cichorioideae. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. This fern-like plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
