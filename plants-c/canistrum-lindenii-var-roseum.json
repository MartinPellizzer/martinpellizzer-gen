    "intro": "Canistrum lindenii var. roseum, commonly known as the pink-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, glossy leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces non-toxic berries that are a food source for various birds and small mammals. It is native to parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if not managed properly."
