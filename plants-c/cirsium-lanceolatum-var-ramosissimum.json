    "intro": "Cirsium lanceolatum var. ramosissimum, commonly known as the hairy thistle, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are covered in dense, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is also known for its robust root system, which allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions."
