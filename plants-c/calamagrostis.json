    "intro": "Calamagrostis, commonly known as switchgrass, is a genus of grasses native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It consists of several species, many of which are perennial and thrive in wet or moist environments. The plants typically have tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often silver or gray-green in color. Calamagrostis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are also used in ecological restoration projects. They produce feathery plumes that add visual interest in the fall."
