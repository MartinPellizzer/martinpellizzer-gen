    "intro": "Copiapoa coquimbana subsp. pseudocoquimbana, commonly known as the Coquimbo copiapoa, is a succulent cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring. It has a slow growth rate and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions with minimal rainfall. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology compared to the main species, Copiapoa coquimbana."
