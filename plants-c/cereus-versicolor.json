    "intro": "Cereus versicolor, commonly known as the rainbow cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking flowers that range in color from white to pink, yellow, and red, often opening at night. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Cereus versicolor is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
