    "intro": "Coilostigma zeyherianum var. tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved coilostigma, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elliptical, woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is adapted to arid environments, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
