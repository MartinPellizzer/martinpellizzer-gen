    "intro": "Commelina disperma, commonly known as the wandering jaeger, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Commelinales order and the Commelinaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with strikingly colored bracts. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by showy, leaf-like bracts. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Commelina disperma is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream banks."
