    "intro": "Carex pediformis var. caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant forms dense clumps of grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like clusters of brownish flowers that appear in late summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
