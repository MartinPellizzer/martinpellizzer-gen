    "intro": "Capraria saxifragifolia, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a flowering plant belonging to the Primulaceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Capraria saxifragifolia is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with poor soil conditions."
