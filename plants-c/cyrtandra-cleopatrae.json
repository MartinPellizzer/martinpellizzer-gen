    "intro": "Cyrtandra cleopatrae, commonly known as Cleopatra's Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant is often found growing in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly honeycreepers. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
