    "intro": "Calliandra brevicaulis var. glabra, commonly known as the silky calliandra, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red or orange flowers, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are typically smooth and often covered in a fine, silky hair, which is a distinguishing feature of the glabra variant. This plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in warm, sunny climates."
