    "intro": "Calochortus venustus var. lilacinus, commonly known as the lilac glory-of-the-snow, is a striking member of the Liliaceae family native to the western United States. This perennial herb features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale lilac to deep purple, blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a basal rosette of foliage that persists through the winter. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and delicate, ephemeral beauty."
