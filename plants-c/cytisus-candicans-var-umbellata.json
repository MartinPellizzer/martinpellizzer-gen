    "intro": "Cytisus candicans var. umbellata, commonly known as the yellow broom or golden broom, is a flowering shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, woody stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it is sometimes considered a weed in non-native habitats."
