    "intro": "Carex tomentosa f. pallida, commonly known as the white-haired sedge, is a variant of the common sedge found in wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with a distinctive silvery-white covering on the leaves, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in northern temperate regions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in stabilizing wetland habitats."
