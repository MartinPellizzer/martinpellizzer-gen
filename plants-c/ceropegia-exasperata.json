    "intro": "Ceropegia exasperata, commonly known as the string of hearts, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular as a houseplant and is relatively easy to care for."
