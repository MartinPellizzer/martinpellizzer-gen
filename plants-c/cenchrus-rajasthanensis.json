    "intro": "Cenchrus rajasthanensis, commonly known as the Rajasthan grass, is a species of grass native to the arid regions of northern India. It is a perennial plant characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low rainfall. Due to its resilience, it is often found in dry, sandy soils and is used in ecological restoration projects in arid regions."
