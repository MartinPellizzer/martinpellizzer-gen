    "intro": "Cassytha strigosa, commonly known as the creeping knotweed, is a perennial vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and they are typically greenish-white in color. Cassytha strigosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks."
