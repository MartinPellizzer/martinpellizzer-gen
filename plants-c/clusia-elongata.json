    "intro": "Clusia elongata, commonly known as the fatshedder or broadleaf poinsettia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval or lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a glossy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, which are often surrounded by colorful bracts that resemble petals. Clusia elongata is well adapted to humid, shady environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage. It is also valued for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
