    "intro": "Carduus fortior, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring a robust stem covered in sharp, spiny leaves. The plant produces purple to violet composite flowers, which consist of both ray florets and tubular florets. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Carduus fortior is known for its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and astringent effects."
