    "intro": "Caladium tuberosum, commonly known as the arrowhead vine, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored in shades of green, red, and white. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically followed by cylindrical, tuberous roots. These tubers are not only ornamental but also edible when properly prepared. Caladium tuberosum thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
