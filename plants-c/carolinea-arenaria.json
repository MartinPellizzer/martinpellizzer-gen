    "intro": "Carolinea arenaria, commonly known as the sand dune carnation, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, maritime conditions. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. Carolinea arenaria plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
