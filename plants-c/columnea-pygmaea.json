    "intro": "Columnea pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf flame flower, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features showy, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting hummingbirds and other pollinators. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea pygmaea is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation in warm, humid environments."
