    "intro": "Claytonia paniculata, commonly known as the clustered springbeauty, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy white or pink flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Claytonia paniculata is a perennial herb that is relatively easy to grow in garden settings with proper care."
