    "intro": "Chenopodium spathulatum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf goosefoot, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and has a low, sprawling growth habit. The plant features alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a bluish-gray underside. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
