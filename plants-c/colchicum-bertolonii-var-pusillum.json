    "intro": "Colchicum bertolonii var. pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It produces striking violet-blue flowers in the autumn, typically from September to November. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and grows in rocky or gravelly soils. It is part of the Colchicaceae family and contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
