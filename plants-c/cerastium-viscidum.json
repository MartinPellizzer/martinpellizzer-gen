    "intro": "Cerastium viscidum, commonly known as sticky weed or sticky chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a glandular, sticky substance that gives it its common name. Cerastium viscidum thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along pathways."
