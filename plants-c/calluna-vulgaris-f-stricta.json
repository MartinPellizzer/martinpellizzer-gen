    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris f. stricta, commonly known as the compact heather, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the British Isles. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in horticultural settings."
