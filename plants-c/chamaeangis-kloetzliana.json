    "intro": "Chamaeangis kloetzliana, commonly known as the Kleitzli's rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone substrates, thriving in cool, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers per stem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
