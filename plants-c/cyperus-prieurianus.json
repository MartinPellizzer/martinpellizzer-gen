    "intro": "Cyperus prieurianus, commonly known as the papyrus sedge, is a perennial wetland plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist or aquatic environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Cyperus prieurianus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in papermaking."
