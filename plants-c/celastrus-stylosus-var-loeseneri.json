It is a climbing shrub characterized by its twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
