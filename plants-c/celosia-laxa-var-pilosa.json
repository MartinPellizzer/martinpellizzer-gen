It is characterized by its distinctive, plume-like inflorescences that resemble a cock's comb, hence its common name. The plant features soft, fuzzy bracts that give it a unique, textured appearance. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall fluffy appearance."
