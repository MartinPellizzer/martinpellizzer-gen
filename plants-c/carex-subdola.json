    "intro": "Carex subdola, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Native to various regions in North America, it typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are clustered in dense spikes, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
