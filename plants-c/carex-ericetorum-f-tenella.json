    "intro": "Carex ericetorum f. tenella, commonly known as the compact or dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the British Isles. It is a compact form of Carex ericetorum, characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that typically bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges or heathland environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for wetland gardens and conservation areas."
