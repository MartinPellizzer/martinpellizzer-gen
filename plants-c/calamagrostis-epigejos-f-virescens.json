    "intro": "Calamagrostis epigejos f. virescens, commonly known as the green tufted grass, is a variant of the tufted grass species native to eastern North America. It is a perennial grass characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, tufted clumps of foliage. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically have a bluish-green hue, which distinguishes it from other similar species. It produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. This plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other riparian habitats."
