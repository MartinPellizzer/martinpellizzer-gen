It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom throughout the summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
