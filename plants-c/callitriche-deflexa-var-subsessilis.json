    "intro": "Callitriche deflexa var. subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant features slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences at the water's surface. This variety is characterized by its short, sessile leaves, distinguishing it from other varieties within the Callitriche genus."
