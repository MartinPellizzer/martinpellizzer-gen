    "intro": "Coilostylis emarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It typically grows in wetland and swampy environments, thriving in moist, clay soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its root system is fibrous, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Coilostylis emarginata plays a role in maintaining wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
