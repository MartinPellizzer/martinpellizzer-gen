    "intro": "Chamaefilix serra, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Chamaefilix serra is often found in open, sunny areas and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
