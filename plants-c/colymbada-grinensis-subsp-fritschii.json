    "intro": "Colymbada grinensis subsp. fritschii, commonly known as the Gruenwald's colymbada, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
