    "intro": "Cytisus sessilis, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, woody stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and usually sessile, giving it a distinctive appearance. Cytisus sessilis is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
