It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which can range from elliptical to ovate. The plant produces showy, camellia-like flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its evergreen foliage provides ornamental value throughout the year, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Camellia heterophylla is also valued for its resilience to cold temperatures, which enhances its adaptability in temperate climates."
