    "intro": "Cyathula obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It features a basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Cyathula obtusifolia is noted for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
