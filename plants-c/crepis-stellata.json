    "intro": "Crepis stellata, commonly known as the starless thistle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces achenes, which are dry, one-seeded fruits that are typically dispersed by wind. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows and grasslands. Its botanical features make it an important species for pollinators and a subject of ecological study."
