    "intro": "Cephalorrhynchus rechingerianus, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a distinct hooded structure. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
