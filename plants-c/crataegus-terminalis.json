    "intro": "Crataegus terminalis, commonly known as the Pacific crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and features thorned branches, which are characteristic of many species in the genus Crataegus. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or yellow berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodlands. The Pacific crabapple is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine."
