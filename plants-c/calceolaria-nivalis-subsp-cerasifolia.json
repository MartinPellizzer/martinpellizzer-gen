    "intro": "Calceolaria nivalis subsp. cerasifolia, commonly known as the pink snow calceolaria, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, lip-like petals that range in color from pink to red, which are adapted to attract pollinators in high-altitude environments. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine habitats and is well-suited to cold climates. Its flowers bloom during the short growing season in high-altitude regions, often in late spring or early summer. The subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific alpine conditions."
