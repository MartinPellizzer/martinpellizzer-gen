    "intro": "Crassocephalum torreanum, commonly known as the common iron plant or African iron plant, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the growing season. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some areas where it has escaped cultivation."
