    "intro": "Columnea lindenii, commonly known as the \"Linden's flame\" or \"Flame of the Forest,\" is a striking flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds, which are attracted to its nectar-rich blooms. Columnea lindenii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or greenhouses."
