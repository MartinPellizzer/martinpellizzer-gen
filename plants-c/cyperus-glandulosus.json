    "intro": "Cyperus glandulosus, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Cyperus glandulosus is often found in wetlands, marshes, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
