It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring thornless stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its botanical characteristics include simple, alternate leaves and an extensive root system that helps stabilize soil. It is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and moist soils, making it a valuable component of native ecosystems."
