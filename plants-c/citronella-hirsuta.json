    "intro": "Citronella hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy citronella, is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically borne at the base of the plant. It is widely cultivated for its aromatic properties, as the leaves contain essential oils that are used in natural insect repellents. Due to its hardy nature, it thrives in warm, humid climates and is often grown as an ornamental or for its practical applications."
