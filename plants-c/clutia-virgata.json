    "intro": "Clutia virgata, commonly known as the blue milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom throughout the wet season. Clutia virgata is known for its milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of the milkweed genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
