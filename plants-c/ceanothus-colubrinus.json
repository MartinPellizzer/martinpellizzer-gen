    "intro": "Ceanothus colubrinus, commonly known as the blue curl ceanothus, is a shrub native to California, particularly found in coastal and inland regions. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and striking clusters of sky-blue, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Ceanothus colubrinus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in its native habitat."
