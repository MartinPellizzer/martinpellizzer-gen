    "intro": "Condylopodium cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Andean moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant exhibits a complex thallus structure with a dense network of rhizoids and a well-developed leaf system. Its leaves are usually small, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable indicator species for ecological studies in alpine ecosystems."
