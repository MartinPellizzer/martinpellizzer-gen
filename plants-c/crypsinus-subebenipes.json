    "intro": "Crypsinus subebenipes, commonly known as the rare tropical orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the understory of tropical rainforests. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is found in limited regions of Southeast Asia."
