    "intro": "Cerastium caespitosum subsp. fontanum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, hairy leaves that are often clustered at the base, giving it a mat-like appearance. The plant produces tiny white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Due to its compact growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
