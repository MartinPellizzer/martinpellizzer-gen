It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves that are arranged in a rosette at the base, and its stems spread horizontally along the ground. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Cerastium laxum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic plant of temperate regions."
