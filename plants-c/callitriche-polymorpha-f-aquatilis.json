    "intro": "Callitriche polymorpha f. aquatilis, commonly known as the water starwort, is a floating aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable aquatic indicator species and a potential invasive weed."
