    "intro": "Cytisus striatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broom, is a flowering shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, wiry stems that often grow in dense thickets, and its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Cytisus striatus is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which can improve soil fertility in degraded areas."
