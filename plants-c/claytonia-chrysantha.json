    "intro": "Claytonia chrysantha, commonly known as the golden mite or yellow spring beauty, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features delicate, clustered stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, resembling miniature sunflowers, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
