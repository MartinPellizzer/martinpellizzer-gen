    "intro": "Chionanthus vernalis, commonly known as the flowering dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its showy, white or cream-colored bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in umbels, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Chionanthus vernalis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
