    "intro": "Cnidoscolus magni-gerdtii, commonly known as the giant spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to parts of South America. It is a large shrub or small tree that can grow up to several meters in height, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and striking yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, toxic seeds. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, though caution is required due to the presence of irritants in its sap."
