    "intro": "Centaurium calycosum var. nanum, commonly known as dwarf mouse-eared cow-wheat, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, delicate flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for certain pollinators and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
