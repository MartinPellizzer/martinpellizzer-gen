    "intro": "Colpodium monandrum, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. It has simple, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. Colpodium monandrum is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments."
