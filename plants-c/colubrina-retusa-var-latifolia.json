It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 15 feet. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to native gardens.
