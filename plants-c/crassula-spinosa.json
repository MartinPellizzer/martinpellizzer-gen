    "intro": "Crassula spinosa, commonly known as the woolly crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Crassula spinosa is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that is well-suited to coastal and Mediterranean climates."
