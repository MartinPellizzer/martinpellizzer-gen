    "intro": "Commiphora welwitschii, commonly known as the African myrrh, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is known for exuding a fragrant resin, which has been used traditionally for medicinal and aromatic purposes. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable in some regions."
