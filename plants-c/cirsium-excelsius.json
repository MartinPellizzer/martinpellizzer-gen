    "intro": "Cirsium excelsius, commonly known as the giant thistle, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy purple flowers. The plant typically grows to heights of up to 2 meters, making it one of the tallest thistle species. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in stiff, prickly hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
