    "intro": "Calamus compsostachys, commonly known as the narrow-leaved calamus, is a member of the Arecaceae family, which includes palms. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and long, narrow leaves that are often arched over the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typically found at the base of the leaves. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
