It is characterized by its unique rosette-like arrangement of leaves and its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent sepals and petals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
