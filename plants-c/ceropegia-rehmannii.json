    "intro": "Ceropegia rehmannii, commonly known as the string of hearts or heartleaf ceropegia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ceropegia rehmannii is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
