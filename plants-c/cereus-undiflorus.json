    "intro": "Cereus undiflorus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are usually short-lived, lasting only a single night. Cereus undiflorus is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems."
