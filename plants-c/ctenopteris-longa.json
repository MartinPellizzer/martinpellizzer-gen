    "intro": "Ctenopteris longa, commonly known as the long frond sea palm, is a species of fern native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments, often found in mangrove swamps or along rocky shores. Its fronds are typically pinnately compound, with small, clustered sori on the underside. Ctenopteris longa plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
