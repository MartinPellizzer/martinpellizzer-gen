    "intro": "Chlorospatha queremalensis, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow fronds that contrast sharply with its dark green undersides. The plant belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is known for its compact, shield-shaped foliage. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
