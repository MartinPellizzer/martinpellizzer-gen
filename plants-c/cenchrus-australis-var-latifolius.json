    "intro": "Cenchrus australis var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its robust, rhizomatous growth habit and wide, flat leaves that are typically hairy along the margins. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which contain small, pale brown seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for erosion control and as a forage plant."
