    "intro": "Cachrys cryptodiscua, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive appearance with pale green, leafless stems and clusters of small, white or greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are typically reduced to scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves. Cachrys cryptodiscua is adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in the canopy of pine forests."
