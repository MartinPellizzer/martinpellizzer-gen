    "intro": "Centrolepis strigosa subsp. pulvinata, commonly known as the woolly centrolepis, is a unique plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its distinctive, compact growth habit. The plant features wiry, grass-like stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. It produces spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many Cyperaceae species. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments."
