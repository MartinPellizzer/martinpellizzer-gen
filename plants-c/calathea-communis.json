    "intro": "Calathea communis, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, patterned leaves that often change color in response to light conditions. The plant thrives in humid, warm environments and requires indirect sunlight to maintain its vibrant foliage. Its leaves exhibit nyctinasty, a behavior where they fold shut at night, resembling prayer. Calathea communis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
