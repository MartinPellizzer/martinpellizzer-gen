    "intro": "Catasetum macrocarpum var. aurantiacum, commonly known as the golden-capped orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear bright yellow to orange flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are specialized for pollination by specific wasps, featuring a unique structure that facilitates this process. The orchid's foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to retain moisture."
