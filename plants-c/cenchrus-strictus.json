    "intro": "Cenchrus strictus, commonly known as rigid sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive drought conditions. Cenchrus strictus is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
