It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Cyperus chalaranthus thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
