    "intro": "Cerastium semidecandrum var. dentatum, commonly known as the toothed mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, ovate leaves with distinctive serrated edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its hairy stems and clustered growth habit help it retain moisture and withstand mild frosts."
