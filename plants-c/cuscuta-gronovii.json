    "intro": "Cuscuta gronovii, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless stems. The plant attaches to its host using specialized haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is found in various regions across the globe and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Cuscuta gronovii plays a role in ecological interactions, though its parasitic nature can negatively impact its host plants."
