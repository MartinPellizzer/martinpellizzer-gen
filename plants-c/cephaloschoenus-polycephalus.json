    "intro": "Cephaloschoenus polycephalus, commonly known as the many-headed water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it its common name. The plant has broad, floating leaves that support its buoyant structure and facilitate photosynthesis. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate of freshwater habitats. Cephaloschoenus polycephalus plays an important ecological role by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
