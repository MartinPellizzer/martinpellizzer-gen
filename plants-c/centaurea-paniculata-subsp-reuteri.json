    "intro": "Centaurea paniculata subsp. reuteri, commonly known as the narrowleaf star-thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces dense, spiny clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps in distinguishing it from other thistle species. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. This subspecies is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
