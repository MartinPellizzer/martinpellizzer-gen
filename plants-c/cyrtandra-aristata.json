    "intro": "Cyrtandra aristata, commonly known as the arrowleaf cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pink, with five petals arranged symmetrically. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyrtandra aristata is considered a rare and endangered species."
