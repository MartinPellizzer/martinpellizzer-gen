    "intro": "Carex tuberculata, commonly known as the rough sedges, is a perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences with small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex tuberculata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
