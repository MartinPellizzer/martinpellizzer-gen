    "intro": "Cestrum parciflorum, commonly known as the sparse-flowered cestrum, is a species of flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are tubular and attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths, and the plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans."
