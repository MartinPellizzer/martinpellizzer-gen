    "intro": "Carex ulobasis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it often grows in wet or moist soils, such as marshes or along stream banks. The plant produces small, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
