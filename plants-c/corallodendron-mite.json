    "intro": "Corallodendron mite, commonly known as the coral tree mite, is a small arachnid belonging to the family Eriophyidae. It is primarily found on the leaves of the corallodendron plant, which is native to tropical regions. The mite feeds on plant sap, causing characteristic galling on the foliage. Its life cycle involves several stages, including egg, larvae, nymph, and adult. While it does not pose a direct threat to humans, it can significantly impact the health of its host plant."
