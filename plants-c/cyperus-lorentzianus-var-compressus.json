    "intro": "Cyperus lorentzianus var. compressus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a dense, cylindrical cluster, typical of the sedge family. The leaves are narrow and compressed, giving the plant its common name and contributing to its distinct appearance."
