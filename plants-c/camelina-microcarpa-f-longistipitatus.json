    "intro": "Camelina microcarpa f. longistipitatus, commonly known as the long-stemmed camelina, is a variant of the annual flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its elongated peduncles, which distinguish it from other forms of Camelina microcarpa. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, linear leaves and small yellow flowers arranged in racemes. It thrives in dry, temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and potential ecological adaptations."
