    "intro": "Cotyledon tardiflora, commonly known as the slow-flowering cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, adapted for storing water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
