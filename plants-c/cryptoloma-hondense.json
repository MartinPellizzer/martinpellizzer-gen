    "intro": "Cryptoloma hondense, commonly known as the Honduran cryptoloma, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are usually pink or purple in color. Due to habitat loss, Cryptoloma hondense is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
