    "intro": "Cyperus aristulatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its slender, grass-like leaves are arranged in tight, triangular clusters, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Cyperus aristulatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
