    "intro": "Carex pseudocyperus subsp. haenkeana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its flowers are small and clustered, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the sedge family. The subspecies haenkeana is distinguished by its slender stems and shorter, more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form."
