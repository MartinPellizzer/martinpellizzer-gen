It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive yellowish-green color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in the spring. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, pod-like structure that splits open when mature. Cassia caespitosa is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woodlands."
