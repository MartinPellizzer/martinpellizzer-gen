    "intro": "Cyanea bonita, commonly known as the Hawaiian beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly Hawaii. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, lantern-shaped fruits that are typically deep purple or red in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Cyanea bonita thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats."
