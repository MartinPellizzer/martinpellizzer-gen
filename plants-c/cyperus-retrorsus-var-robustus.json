    "intro": "Cyperus retrorsus var. robustus, commonly known as the broadleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a fibrous root system adapted to wet or waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in marshy areas, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, making it a common wetland species. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate standing water make it both a useful indicator plant and a potential invasive species in some environments."
