    "intro": "Coronilla juncea subsp. juncea, commonly known as narrowleaf crownvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in dense spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and nodulated, allowing it to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it a valuable plant for soil enrichment. It is often used in erosion control and as a forage plant due to its hardiness and adaptability."
