    "intro": "Cyphokentia thurstonii, commonly known as the Thurston's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. This plant is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
