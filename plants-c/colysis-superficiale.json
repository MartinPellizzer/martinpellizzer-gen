    "intro": "Colysis superficiale, commonly known as the surface-cutting plant, is a unique species characterized by its specialized root system that allows it to absorb nutrients from the top layer of soil. Its leaves are broad and flat, designed to maximize sunlight absorption while minimizing water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by wind rather than insects. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its shallow root system, it is particularly sensitive to drought conditions."
