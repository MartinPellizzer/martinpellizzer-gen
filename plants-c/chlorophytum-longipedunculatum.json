    "intro": "Chlorophytum longipedunculatum, commonly known as the snake plant or mother-in-law's tongue, is a hardy, evergreen perennial native to South Africa. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with yellow or white stripes. The plant produces long, slender inflorescences that bear small, white flowers, though it is more commonly cultivated for its attractive foliage than for its blooms. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ability to purify air and its low maintenance requirements further enhance its appeal as a houseplant."
