The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in wetland ecosystems and a common indicator of waterlogged soils."
