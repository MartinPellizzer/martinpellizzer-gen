It thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, greenish-brown spikes. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various organisms."
