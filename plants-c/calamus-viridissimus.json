It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near water bodies. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine. The leaves are broad and have a distinctive, waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in humid conditions."
