    "intro": "Calycera balsamitifolia, commonly known as the balsam leaf calycera, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into several lobes, and its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of botanical circles."
