The plant has hairy, rugose (rough) stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower displays."
