    "intro": "Carex filifolia, commonly known as the thread-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex filifolia typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, stream banks, or woodland edges. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
