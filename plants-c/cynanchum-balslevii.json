It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny fruit capsules. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
