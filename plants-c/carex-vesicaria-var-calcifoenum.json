    "intro": "Carex vesicaria var. calcifoenum, commonly known as the calciphile sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to calcareous soils in Europe. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its clumping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its preference for alkaline soils, it is a valuable indicator species for calcium-rich environments."
