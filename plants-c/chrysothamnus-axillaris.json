It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which are typically found in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native range."
