    "intro": "Centaurea hanryi subsp. hanryi, commonly known as the Alaskan sea holly, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of Alaska and northern Canada. It is characterized by its blue to purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, grass-like bracts. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight hairy texture. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh maritime environments."
