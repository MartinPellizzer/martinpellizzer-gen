    "intro": "Cybelion pulchellum, commonly known as the beautiful cybelion, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from deep purples to bright yellows. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a conservation concern."
