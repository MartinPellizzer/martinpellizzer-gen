    "intro": "Cyathea superba, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots and a crown of large, compound fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its fronds can grow up to several meters in length, with a feathery appearance. Cyathea superba plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
