    "intro": "Celastrus woodii, commonly known as the Appalachian beauty, is a rare and endangered species native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Celastrus woodii thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
