    "intro": "Crepidium hoi, commonly known as the Hoi's orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires specific humidity and temperature conditions to flourish. Due to its limited natural range and habitat destruction, Crepidium hoi is considered an endangered species."
