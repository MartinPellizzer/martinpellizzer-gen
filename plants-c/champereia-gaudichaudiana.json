    "intro": "Champereia gaudichaudiana, commonly known as the coastal chamomile, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found growing along the edges of dunes and in open coastal vegetation. Due to its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion."
