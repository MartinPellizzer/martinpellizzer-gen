    "intro": "Cytisus alpinus var. pilosus, commonly known as the Alpine broom, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, woody stems covered in a fine, hairy coating, which helps it retain moisture in harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are small, trifoliate, and often covered in a similar fuzzy texture. This variety is adapted to rocky soils and high altitudes, making it a hardy plant found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
