    "intro": "Cerasus cyclamina var. biflora, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry. This variant is a cultivar of the Japanese cherry, characterized by its distinctive double blooms that give it a more elaborate appearance than typical single-flowered varieties. It is native to Japan and is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. The plant produces small, sweet fruits that are edible but less commonly consumed compared to other cherry varieties. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth."
