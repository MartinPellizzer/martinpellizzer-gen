    "intro": "Cyathea, commonly known as the tree ferns, are a genus of ferns belonging to the family Cyatheaceae. They are characterized by their tall, unbranched stems that resemble tree trunks, covered with a layer of persistent, fibrous roots. Cyathea species typically have large, compound fronds that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. These plants are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Their unique appearance and ancient lineage make them an important component of many forest ecosystems."
