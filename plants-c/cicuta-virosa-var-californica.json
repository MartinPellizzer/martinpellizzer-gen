    "intro": "Cicuta virosa var. californica, commonly known as poison hemlock, is a toxic plant native to western North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small white flowers. The plant contains several toxic alkaloids, such as cicutoxin, which can cause severe neurological symptoms in animals and humans. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along stream banks and in open woods. Due to its high toxicity, it is considered a noxious weed and should be handled with caution."
