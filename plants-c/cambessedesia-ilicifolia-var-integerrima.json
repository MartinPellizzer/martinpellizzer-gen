    "intro": "Cambessedesia ilicifolia var. integerrima, commonly known as the smooth-leaved hollyleaf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically smooth and glossy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by edible, red berries that are a food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and native landscaping."
