    "intro": "Chlorophytum sphacelatum var. sphacelatum, commonly known as the snake plant, is a perennial evergreen herb native to South Africa. It features long, arching leaves that are typically variegated with white and green stripes, which are a result of its natural genetic variation. The plant is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped foliage and produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on slender stalks. It is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is well-known for its air-purifying properties and low maintenance requirements. This variety is particularly valued for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions."
