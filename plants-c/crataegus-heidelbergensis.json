It is native to Europe and is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red berries in the autumn, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value."
