    "intro": "Corchorus pascuorum, commonly known as goat's beard, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and delicate, feathery bracts that resemble the beard of a goat, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to gardens. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Corchorus pascuorum is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
