    "intro": "Cryptocarya ovatocaudata, commonly known as the oval-tailed cryptocarya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the rainforests of eastern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with lanceolate to ovate leaves that are often glossy and aromatic. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale green, and it produces edible, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native wildlife. Cryptocarya ovatocaudata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and ecological benefits."
