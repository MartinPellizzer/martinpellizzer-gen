It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and showy white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often used in traditional herbal remedies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. The Sicilian hawthorn is adapted to Mediterranean climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
