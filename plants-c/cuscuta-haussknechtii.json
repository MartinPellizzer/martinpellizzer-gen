    "intro": "Cuscuta haussknechtii, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to parts of North America and is often found growing on various species of grasses and shrubs. Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain dormant in the soil for extended periods. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
