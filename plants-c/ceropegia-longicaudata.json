    "intro": "Ceropegia longicaudata, commonly known as the snake plant or staghorn plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often adorned with small, waxy leaves. The plant produces unique, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or yellow, adapted for specific pollinators. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. Its ability to store water in its stems allows it to survive in arid conditions."
