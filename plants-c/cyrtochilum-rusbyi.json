    "intro": "Cyrtochilum rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a slender, often hairy stem and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Cyrtochilum rusbyi is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in understory habitats of tropical rainforests."
