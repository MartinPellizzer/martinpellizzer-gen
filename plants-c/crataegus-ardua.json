    "intro": "Crataegus ardua, commonly known as the mountain hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring thorny branches and dense foliage of elliptical, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in spring, followed by red or orange berries in the autumn. Its fruit is an important food source for birds and small mammals, and the plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Crataegus ardua is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential cardiovascular benefits."
