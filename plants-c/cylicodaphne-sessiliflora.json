    "intro": "Cylicodaphne sessiliflora, commonly known as the broad-leafed sago palm, is a member of the Arecaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, clustered stems and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are borne in dense, spadix-like inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
