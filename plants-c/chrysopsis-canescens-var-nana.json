    "intro": "Chrysopsis canescens var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf silverleaf goldeneye, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It features compact, mat-forming growth with gray-green, silver-hairy foliage that provides a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers in late spring, adding a subtle yet vibrant floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
