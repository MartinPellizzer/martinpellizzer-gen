It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its trailing stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which give it its common name. Its fruit is a fleshy, yellowish berry that contains several seeds. Cissus lemurica is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
