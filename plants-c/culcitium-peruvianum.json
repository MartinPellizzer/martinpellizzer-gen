    "intro": "Culcitium peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Culcitium peruvianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
