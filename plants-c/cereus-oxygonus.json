It is characterized by its segmented, ribbed stems and vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in winter. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ornamental value. The flowers come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and white, making it a striking addition to any space."
