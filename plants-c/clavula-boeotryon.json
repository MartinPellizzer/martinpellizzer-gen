    "intro": "Clavula boeotryon, commonly known as the Boeotian clavula, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
