    "intro": "Caenopteris rhizophylla, commonly known as the root-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are well-developed, allowing it to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
