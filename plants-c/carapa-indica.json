It is characterized by its large, woody trunk and dense canopy, with elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The tree produces unique, woody pods containing edible seeds, which are the source of the highly nutritious Brazil nuts. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a warm, tropical climate. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting biodiversity."
