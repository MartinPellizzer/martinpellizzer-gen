    "intro": "Carex noltiei, commonly known as the Noltie's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swales, and riparian areas. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by three-sided, spike-like fruits. Carex noltiei is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
