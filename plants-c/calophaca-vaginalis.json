    "intro": "Calophaca vaginalis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. Calophaca vaginalis is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse conditions make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed."
