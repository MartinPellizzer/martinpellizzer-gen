It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
