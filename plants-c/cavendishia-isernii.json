    "intro": "Cavendishia isernii, commonly known as the Isern's Cavendish, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces spiny, ribbed stems that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically nocturnal, opening in the evening and closing by morning. Cavendishia isernii is prized by collectors for its unique appearance and is relatively difficult to cultivate due to its specific environmental requirements."
