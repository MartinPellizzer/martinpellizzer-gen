    "intro": "Cyclostemon leiocarpus, commonly known as the white-flowered cycad, is a unique species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It is native to certain regions of Mexico and is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
