    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum pallidum, commonly known as the pale-petaled cirrhosperm, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with distinctive, wavy petals. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded, moist forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
