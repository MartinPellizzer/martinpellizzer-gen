    "intro": "Cryptandra minutifolia subsp. minutifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered cryptandra, is a small shrub native to Western Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought resistance through its succulent stems and reduced leaf surface. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
