    "intro": "Cheilanthes profusa var. minor, commonly known as the small-leaf rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and small, leathery, evergreen leaves that are arranged in a rosette. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent-like leaf structure. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. This variety is often found in crevices and on rocky outcrops, where it forms dense colonies in harsh environments."
