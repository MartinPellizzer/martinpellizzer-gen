    "intro": "Crocion eriocarpum, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant is native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in still or slow-moving waters. Its unique morphology includes bladder-like structures that aid in capturing small aquatic organisms. Crocion eriocarpum plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its habitat by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing microhabitats for aquatic life."
