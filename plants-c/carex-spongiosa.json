    "intro": "Carex spongiosa, commonly known as the spongy sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the summer. The plant has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and filter water, making it ecologically important in wetland ecosystems. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly curled, with a spongy texture that gives it its common name. Carex spongiosa is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
