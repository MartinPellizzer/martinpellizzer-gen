    "intro": "Cyclosorus celebicus, commonly known as the Celebes cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are often submerged in water. The plant typically grows in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it attaches itself to rocks or submerged substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
