    "intro": "Calliandra haematomma var. glabrata, commonly known as the hairy calliandra, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive red and pink bract clusters that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, white, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant landscapes. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system."
