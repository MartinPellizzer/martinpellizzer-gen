    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth hairy bittercress, is a variant of the hairy bittercress species. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its basal leaves and flowering stems that bear clusters of small, white flowers. The leaves are typically alternate and have a rough texture, though the f. glabra form exhibits a smoother leaf surface compared to the typical variety. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This plant is often found in temperate regions and is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
