    "intro": "Calophanes peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular Calophanes, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its blooming period occurs in the spring, producing white to pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
