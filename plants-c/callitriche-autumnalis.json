    "intro": "Callitriche autumnalis, commonly known as autumn water-star, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant. It typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows, and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant has slender, branching stems that often float on the water surface, with small, star-shaped white or pale pink flowers. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in whorls around the stems, and they are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by water currents."
