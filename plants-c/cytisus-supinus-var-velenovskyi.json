    "intro": "Cytisus supinus var. velenovskyi, commonly known as the creeping yellow whitlow, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to its habitat. The plant has slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. This variety is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun and displaying drought tolerance."
