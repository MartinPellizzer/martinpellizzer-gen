It is characterized by its alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive orange to red seed capsules. It contains toxic compounds, primarily in its sap, which can cause severe skin irritation in humans. This plant is often found in moist, shaded areas of forests and is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
