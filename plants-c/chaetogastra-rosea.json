It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or reddish flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
