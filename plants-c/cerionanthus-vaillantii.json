It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in the unique microclimates of its endemic habitat.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
