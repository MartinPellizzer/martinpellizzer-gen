    "intro": "Catodiacrum sparsiflorum, commonly known as the sparseflower catodiacrum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with pale yellow petals and red stamens, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
