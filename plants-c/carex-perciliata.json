    "intro": "Carex perciliata, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. This species typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often green or reddish in color. Carex perciliata is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
