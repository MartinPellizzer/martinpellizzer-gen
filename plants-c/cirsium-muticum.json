    "intro": "Cirsium muticum, commonly known as the sticky thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Native to Europe, it thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a distinctive member of the thistle genus."
