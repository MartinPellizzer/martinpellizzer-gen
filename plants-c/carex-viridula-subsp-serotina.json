    "intro": "Carex viridula subsp. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland or marshy habitats. The plant has grass-like leaves that are often dark green and slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant is known for its late blooming period, usually in late summer or early autumn. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
