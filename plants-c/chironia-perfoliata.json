    "intro": "Chironia perfoliata, commonly known as the perfoliate chironia, is a flowering plant species native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that often have a woolly texture, and it produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
