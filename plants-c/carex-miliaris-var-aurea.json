    "intro": "Carex miliaris var. aurea, commonly known as golden sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that features a striking golden-yellow hue, particularly in the leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy or boggy environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in water-retentive conditions."
