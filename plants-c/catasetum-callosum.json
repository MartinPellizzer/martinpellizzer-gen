    "intro": "Catasetum callosum, commonly known as the showy catasetum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces a unique, elongated labellum that aids in pollination by specific bees. Its growth habit is typically epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. Catasetum callosum thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil."
