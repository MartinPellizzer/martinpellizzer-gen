    "intro": "Coffea ramosa, commonly known as the branching coffee plant, is a species native to Ethiopia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense branching structure, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds used for coffee production. It thrives in high-altitude regions with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its unique morphology and potential for coffee cultivation, it holds interest for both botanical study and agricultural research."
