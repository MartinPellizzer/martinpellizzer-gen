    "intro": "Calamagrostis epigejos var. angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf bluejoint, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and panicles of blue-gray flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swales, and along streambanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
