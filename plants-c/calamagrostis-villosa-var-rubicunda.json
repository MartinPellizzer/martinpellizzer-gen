    "intro": "Calamagrostis villosa var. rubicunda, commonly known as the red silky grass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its striking reddish-pink inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant features soft, silky hairs on its leaves and stems, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, pond edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration and native plant gardens."
