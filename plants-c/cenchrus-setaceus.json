    "intro": "Cenchrus setaceus, commonly known as the bristlegrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy, with narrow, grass-like leaves that have a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to grow in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its drought tolerance and rapid growth make it a common weed in agricultural areas."
