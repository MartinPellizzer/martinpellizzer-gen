    "intro": "Cuscuta serruloba, commonly known as the serrulate dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around host plants, forming a dense network. The plant is native to parts of North America and is often found on a variety of herbaceous hosts. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked."
