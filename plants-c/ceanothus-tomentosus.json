    "intro": "Ceanothus tomentosus, commonly known as the wooly ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Ceanothus tomentosus is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to support local pollinators."
