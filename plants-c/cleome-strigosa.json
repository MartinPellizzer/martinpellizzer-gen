    "intro": "Cleome strigosa, commonly known as spider flower, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Cleome strigosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its delicate blooms and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
