    "intro": "Chileorebutia malleolata, commonly known as the snowball cactus, is a succulent native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It features short, cylindrical stems that often branch at the base, forming a compact, shrub-like structure. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. Chileorebutia malleolata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
