These plants are native to Mexico and are characterized by their vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange. Calistachya species typically grow as annual or biennial herbs, often found in disturbed soils and arid environments. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
