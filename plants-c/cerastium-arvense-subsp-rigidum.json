    "intro": "Cerastium arvense subsp. rigidum, commonly known as rigid mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers during the spring and early summer, which are followed by small, rounded fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
