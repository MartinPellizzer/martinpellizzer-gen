    "intro": "Cynanchum floribundum, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodland areas and features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds. It is part of the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweed species known for their latex sap. Cynanchum floribundum plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though its toxic properties make it unsuitable for human consumption."
