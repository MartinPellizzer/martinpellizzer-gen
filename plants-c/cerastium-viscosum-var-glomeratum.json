    "intro": "Cerastium viscosum var. glomeratum, commonly known as sticky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arctic regions. Its sticky leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
