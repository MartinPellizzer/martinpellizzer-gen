This plant is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in grassland and rocky habitats. Its leaves exhibit significant variation in shape and size, which is a key botanical feature. The flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is often found growing in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
