    "intro": "Clematis dioica subsp. brasiliana, commonly known as Brazilian morning glory, is a climbing vine native to South America. It features heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant is characterized by its dioecious nature, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires support for its vigorous growth. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates."
