It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes over 5,000 species of grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a characteristic V-shaped cross-section. The small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and the plant produces triangular, three-sided seed capsules that mature in the fall."
