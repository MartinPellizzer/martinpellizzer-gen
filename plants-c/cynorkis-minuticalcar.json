    "intro": "Cynorkis minuticalcar, commonly known as the small-spurred orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a short, fleshy rhizome and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with distinctive spurred petals. Its leaves are usually broad and sword-shaped, and the plant is known for its unique floral structure that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
