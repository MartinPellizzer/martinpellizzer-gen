    "intro": "Centemopsis glomerata, commonly known as the clustered centemopsis, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is known for its hairy stems and leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native habitat."
