    "intro": "Cyperus striatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgeland, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Cyperus striatus produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the ends of its stems. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
