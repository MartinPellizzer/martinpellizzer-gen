    "intro": "Cerastium granulatum, commonly known as granulate mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are prostrate, often rooting at the nodes, which helps it spread vegetatively. Cerastium granulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
