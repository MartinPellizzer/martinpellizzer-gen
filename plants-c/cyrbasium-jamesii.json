    "intro": "Cyrbasium jamesii, commonly known as the James' cyrbasium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle beauty to its alpine habitat. Cyrbasium jamesii thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
