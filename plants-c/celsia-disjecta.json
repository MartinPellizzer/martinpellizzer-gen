    "intro": "Celsia disjecta, commonly known as the scattered celsia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its unique growth habit involves producing flowers at the base of the plant, which gives it its common name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Celsia disjecta is considered a species of conservation concern."
