    "intro": "Chamaecrista pygmaea var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf velvet bean, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in racemes. The plant is characterized by its short stature, typically growing no taller than 30 centimeters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its seeds are encased in hairy, pod-like structures that split open to release the seeds when mature."
