    "intro": "Carex amblyorhyncha subsp. pseudolagopina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers. This subspecies is typically found in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
