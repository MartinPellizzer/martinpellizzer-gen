    "intro": "Cyperus erectus var. luridus, commonly known as the golden flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like stems that grow upright, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender panicles. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a distinctive sheath at the base, and the plant is often found in wet or marshy habitats. The golden hue of its inflorescence gives it its common name and makes it visually striking in its native environment."
