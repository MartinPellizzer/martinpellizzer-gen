    "intro": "Carya ovalis var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hirsute hickory, is a variant of the winged hickory native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy or pubescent leaves, which give it its scientific name \"hirsuta,\" meaning hairy in Latin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a serrated margin. The hirsute hickory is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland habitats."
