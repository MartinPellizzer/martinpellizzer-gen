    "intro": "Cardamine amara f. parviflora, commonly known as the lesser watercress, is a botanical variant of the watercress species native to moist, shaded environments. It is a small perennial herb with finely divided, pinnately lobed leaves that resemble those of its parent species. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. Its rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent presence in wetland habitats. Due to its delicate structure and preference for cool, damp conditions, it is often found in stream banks and woodland edges."
