    "intro": "Cocculus macranthus, commonly known as the large-flowered devil's-bit, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy white or pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces dark blue or black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with caution due to its potent chemical composition. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
