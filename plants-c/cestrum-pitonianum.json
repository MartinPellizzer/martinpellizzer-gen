    "intro": "Cestrum pitonianum, commonly known as the Brazilian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming at night. These flowers emit a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, toxic seeds."
