    "intro": "Cacalia adenostyloides, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cacalia adenostyloides is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral ecosystems."
