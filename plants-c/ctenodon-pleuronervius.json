    "intro": "Ctenodon pleuronervius, commonly known as the slender leafy liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, develop from the gametophyte stage and produce spores for propagation. Ctenodon pleuronervius plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
