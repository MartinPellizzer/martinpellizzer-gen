    "intro": "Cyperus intricatus, commonly known as the fragrant flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown. The plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Cyperus intricatus has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its ability to thrive in moist environments makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
