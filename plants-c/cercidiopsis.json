    "intro": "Cercidiopsis, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often silvery-white in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The flowers are typically small and clustered in racemes, and they are usually pale yellow or greenish-white. Cercidiopsis species are native to various regions in Africa and are adapted to dry, arid environments. These plants are sometimes used in traditional medicine and can play a role in soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
