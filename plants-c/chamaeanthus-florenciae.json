    "intro": "Chamaeanthus florenciae, commonly known as the Florencia's rock heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features dense clusters of small, bright pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compact, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a tight, mat-like formation. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
