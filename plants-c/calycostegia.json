    "intro": "Calycostegia, commonly known as the \"false hibiscus,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Malvaceae family. These plants are characterized by their showy, often colorful flowers that resemble those of hibiscus species. The calyx of Calycostegia is distinctive, as it is fused with the sepals and persists throughout the flowering period. They are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing as shrubs or herbs. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant blooms."
