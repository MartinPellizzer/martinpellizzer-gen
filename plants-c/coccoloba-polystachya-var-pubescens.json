    "intro": "Coccoloba polystachya var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy coccoloba, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with a hairy texture, which gives it its common name. The plant is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, typically growing in moist, shaded environments. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind. This plant is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
