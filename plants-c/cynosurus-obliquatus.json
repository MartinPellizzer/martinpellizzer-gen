    "intro": "Cynosurus obliquatus, commonly known as the bent grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curved or twisted, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Cynosurus obliquatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
