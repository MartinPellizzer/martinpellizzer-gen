    "intro": "Colpodium gillettii, commonly known as the Gillett's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. It has thin, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white. Colpodium gillettii is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the nutrients obtained from trapped prey."
