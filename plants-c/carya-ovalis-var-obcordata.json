    "intro": "Carya ovalis var. obcordata, commonly known as the obcordate hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its alternate, simple, and ovate to obcordate-shaped leaves. The tree produces male and female flowers on separate trees, with the female flowers developing into small, spiny nuts enclosed in a husk. Its bark is thick, ridged, and often deeply furrowed, providing a distinctive appearance. The wood is hard and strong, making it valuable for construction and tool-making."
