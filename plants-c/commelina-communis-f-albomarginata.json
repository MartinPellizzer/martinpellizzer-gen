    "intro": "Commelina communis f. albomarginata, commonly known as the white-margin commelina, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers with white margins. The plant has heart-shaped, broad leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The white-margin variant is distinguished by its distinctive white edging on the petals, which sets it apart from other forms of Commelina communis."
