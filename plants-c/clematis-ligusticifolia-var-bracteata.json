It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often with a reddish or purple hue, and produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer. The flowers are typically blue to violet in color, with a distinctive white or light blue center. This variety is characterized by its bracts, which are modified leaves that resemble petals and enhance the plant's ornamental appeal. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
