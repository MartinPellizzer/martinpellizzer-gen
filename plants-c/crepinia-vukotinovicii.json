    "intro": "Crepinia vukotinovicii, commonly known as the Vukotinovi\u0107's crepina, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Balkan region. It is a herbaceous perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
