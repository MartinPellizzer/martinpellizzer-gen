    "intro": "Catevala radula, commonly known as the sticky lichen, is a unique plant that belongs to the Ascomycota phylum. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to surfaces such as rocks and bark. The organism is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungal partner and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which enables it to carry out photosynthesis. Its structure consists of a thallus that is often covered in a layer of sticky substances, aiding in water retention and protection from herbivores. Catevala radula is typically found in moist, shaded environments, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization."
