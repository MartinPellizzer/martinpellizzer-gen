    "intro": "Caprifolium hispidulum, commonly known as the rough honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the northeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late spring, typically yellow or white in color. Its berries are red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Caprifolium hispidulum thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found along streambanks and in thickets."
