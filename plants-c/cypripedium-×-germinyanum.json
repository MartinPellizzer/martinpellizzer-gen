    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 germinyanum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive slipper-shaped flower, which is typically pink or white with a yellow throat. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each pseudobulb supporting a single leaf and a flower spike. It thrives in shaded, moist woodland habitats and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
