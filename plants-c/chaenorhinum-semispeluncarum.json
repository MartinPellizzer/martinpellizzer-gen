    "intro": "Chaenorhinum semispeluncarum, commonly known as the cave morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the limestone caves of southern Europe. It is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on cave walls or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and climbing. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
