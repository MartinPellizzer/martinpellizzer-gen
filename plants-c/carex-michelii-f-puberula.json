    "intro": "Carex michelii f. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent sedge, is a variant of the broader Carex michelii species. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like appearance and fibrous root system. The plant features dense, cylindrical inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow, linear, and covered with a fine, hairy coating, which gives it the \"puberula\" designation. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded environments such as wet meadows and forest understories."
