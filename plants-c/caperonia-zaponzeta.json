    "intro": "Caperonia zaponzeta, commonly known as the Zaponzeta heather, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or woodland settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
