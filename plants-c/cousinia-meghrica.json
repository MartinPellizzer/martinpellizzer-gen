It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps it withstand cold and arid conditions. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Cousinia meghrica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
