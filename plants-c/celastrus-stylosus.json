    "intro": "Celastrus stylosus, commonly known as the slender staff-vine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a woody vine that typically grows in moist, shaded areas of forests. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture. Celastrus stylosus is often found climbing trees or shrubs, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife by providing food and habitat."
