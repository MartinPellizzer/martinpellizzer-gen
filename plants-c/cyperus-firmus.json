    "intro": "Cyperus firmus, commonly known as hardy flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas or along waterways. Its slender, cylindrical stems are often mistaken for grasses, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Cyperus firmus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
