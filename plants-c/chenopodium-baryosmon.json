    "intro": "Chenopodium baryosmon, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with succulent, spiny stems and lobed, fleshy leaves. Its small greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round, edible seeds. It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a food source."
