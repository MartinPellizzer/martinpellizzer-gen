    "intro": "Cuscuta japonica var. fissistyla, commonly known as the Japanese dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to East Asia and is often found growing on a variety of herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants."
