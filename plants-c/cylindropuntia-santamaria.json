    "intro": "Cylindropuntia santamaria, commonly known as Santa Maria cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically covered in clusters of small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for both humans and animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along desert borders. Due to its adaptability, it plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife."
