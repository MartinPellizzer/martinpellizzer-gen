    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris pinnatofoliosa, commonly known as the peppergrass or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its alternate, pinnately compound leaves that give it a distinctive feathery appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne on slender stems. Its fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive weed in many regions."
