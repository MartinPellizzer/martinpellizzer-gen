    "intro": "Carex punctata subsp. lainzii, commonly known as the Lainz sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its finely textured foliage and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the broader Carex punctata species."
