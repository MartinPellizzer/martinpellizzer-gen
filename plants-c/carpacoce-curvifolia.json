    "intro": "Carpacoce curvifolia, commonly known as the curlyleaf moss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are typically narrow, curved, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It is often found growing on rocks or in forest floors, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered an indicator species for undisturbed habitats."
