    "intro": "Chlorophora greveana, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and fragrant wood. The plant has a compact growth habit and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by dark, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
