    "intro": "Cyperus marquisensis, commonly known as the Marquis sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their rhizomatous growth and spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, exhibiting narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its botanical structure is adapted for aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, with specialized root systems for oxygen absorption. Cyperus marquisensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
