    "intro": "Chondrorhyncha embreei, commonly known as the embree's coral-root, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for nutrient uptake. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers are small and white, with a unique, coral-like appearance that gives it its common name. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered in many regions."
