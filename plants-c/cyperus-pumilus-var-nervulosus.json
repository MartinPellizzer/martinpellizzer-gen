    "intro": "Cyperus pumilus var. nervulosus, commonly known as the narrow-veined flatsedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, swamps, or along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are usually green or reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and have distinct, parallel veins, which give it its scientific name. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
