    "intro": "Campanula kolakovskyi, commonly known as the Kolakovsky bellflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Campanula kolakovskyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized gardens due to its unique appearance and limited distribution."
