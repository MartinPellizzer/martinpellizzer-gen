    "intro": "Cephalanthera pallens subsp. ochroleuca, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its pale green to white flowers. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and forest edges. The plant has a short rhizome and produces a single, erect stem bearing several showy, hooded flowers. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged in a rosette at the base of the stem. The species is notable for its ability to photosynthesize, as it lacks the typical mycorrhizal associations found in many orchids."
