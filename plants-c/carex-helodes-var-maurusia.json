It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants commonly found in wet or moist environments. This sedge typically grows in marshy areas, stream banks, and other damp habitats, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-green coloration, and it produces small, clustered flower spikes in the summer. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
