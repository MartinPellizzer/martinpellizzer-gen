    "intro": "Cleisostoma dichroanthum var. teurnamense, commonly known as the Teurnamense ghost orchid, is a rare and exquisite epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that display a striking dichroic effect, appearing different under various light conditions. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture light in the dense forest canopy. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
