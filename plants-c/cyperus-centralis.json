    "intro": "Cyperus centralis, commonly known as spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and covered with fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Cyperus centralis is often found in wetland habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
