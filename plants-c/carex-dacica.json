    "intro": "Carex dacica, commonly known as the Dacian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeastern Europe. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Carex dacica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
