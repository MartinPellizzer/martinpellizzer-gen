    "intro": "Cerastium pallens, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant has hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, rocky areas, and along roadsides. Cerastium pallens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
