    "intro": "Cassytha ceratopoda, commonly known as the creeping grapevine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It has slender, serpentine stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often trailing along the ground or climbing over other vegetation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Cassytha ceratopoda is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
