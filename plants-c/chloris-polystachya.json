It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Chloris polystachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
