    "intro": "Cycas speciosa, commonly known as the ornamental cycad, is a species of cycad native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the male cones appearing at the base of the plant and the female cones emerging higher up. Cycas speciosa is a slow-growing plant that can live for centuries, making it a long-lived ornamental species. It is often cultivated for its unique appearance and historical significance in botany."
