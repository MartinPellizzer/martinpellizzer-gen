    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 eucharis, commonly known as the imperial orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium guttatum. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive yellow and green coloration, often resembling a crown. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded environments, such as forests, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, upright spike bearing several flowers. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts, though it is also considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
