    "intro": "Carmichaelia arborea, commonly known as the tree fern, is a striking plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a unique structure with a central stem covered in a fibrous sheath, and it produces spores rather than seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and forested areas. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is a valued species in conservation efforts."
