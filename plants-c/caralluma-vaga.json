    "intro": "Caralluma vaga, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and India. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by orange or red berries. Its leaves are typically reduced to small spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Caralluma vaga is also known for its traditional use in herbal remedies."
