    "intro": "Crucifera linicola, commonly known as the creeping coltsfoot, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in meadows. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
