    "intro": "Corchorus senegalensis, commonly known as Senegal cotton or African broomrape, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its fibrous roots, it is sometimes considered a weed but has also been used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
