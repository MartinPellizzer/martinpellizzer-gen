    "intro": "Cincinalis aquilina, commonly known as the skyrocket, is a hardy shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, evergreen foliage that provides year-round visual interest. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Cincinalis aquilina is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
