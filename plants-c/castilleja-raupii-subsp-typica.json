    "intro": "Castilleja raupii subsp. typica, commonly known as the Raup's paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red-orange inflorescences that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host for water and nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Castilleja raupii subsp. typica is often found in association with other members of the genus, forming dense, colorful displays in its native range."
