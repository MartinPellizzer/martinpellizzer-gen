    "intro": "Carex vulgaris var. tricostata, commonly known as the three-costate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is notable for its distinctive leaf structure, featuring three prominent longitudinal ribs that give it its common name."
