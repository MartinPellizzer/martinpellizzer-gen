    "intro": "Clematis keilii, commonly known as the Keil's clematis, is a deciduous vine native to China. It features compound leaves with three to five oval-shaped leaflets and produces fragrant, blue-violet flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has a climbing habit and can reach lengths of up to 15 feet, making it suitable for trellises or walls. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Clematis keilii is relatively low maintenance but benefits from regular pruning to encourage blooming."
