    "intro": "Cardaminopsis, commonly known as the rock\u767d\u83dc or rock cress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plants are often found in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Cardaminopsis species usually have basal leaves that are deeply lobed or dissected, and they produce small, capsule-like fruits. These plants are of interest to botanists due to their unique adaptations to harsh environments."
