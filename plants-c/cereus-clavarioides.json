    "intro": "Cereus clavarioides, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a flowering cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that often branches into a tree-like structure. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. Due to its striking appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for ornamental cultivation."
