    "intro": "Coffea arabica var. maragogype, commonly known as the Brazilian Maragogi, is a variety of coffee known for its large, elongated beans. It originates from the state of Maranh\u00e3o in Brazil and is characterized by its distinctively sweet and fruity flavor profile. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is typically grown at higher altitudes, contributing to its unique aroma and taste.
