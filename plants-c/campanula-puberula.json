It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, contributing to its overall textured foliage. Campanula puberula is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
