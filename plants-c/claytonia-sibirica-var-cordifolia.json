It features basal rosettes of heart-shaped, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink during early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique and ornamental addition to gardens in suitable climates."
