    "intro": "Coccinia intermedia, commonly known as the small-leaf cucumber or wild cucumber, is a vine species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbit plants like pumpkins and melons. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, green, edible fruits that turn orange when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
