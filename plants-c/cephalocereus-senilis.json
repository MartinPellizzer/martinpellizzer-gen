    "intro": "Cephalocereus senilis, commonly known as the old man of the desert, is a slow-growing cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive, almost prehistoric appearance. The plant produces large, night-blooming white flowers that are fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its stem is thick and cylindrical, adapted to store water in arid environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular specimen plant in desert gardens and collections."
