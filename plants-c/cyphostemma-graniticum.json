    "intro": "Cyphostemma graniticum, commonly known as the granite stem or rock fig, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in dry, well-drained soils. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
