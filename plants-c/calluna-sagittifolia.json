    "intro": "Calluna sagittifolia, commonly known as the arrow-leaved heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a compact, mat-like form. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and tundra environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate cold climates."
