It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and have a slightly rough texture. Its flowering spike is cylindrical, bearing small, wind-pollinated flowers that are typically green or brown in color. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
