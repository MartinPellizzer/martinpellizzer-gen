    "intro": "Cereus grandispinus, commonly known as the giant night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its growth is typically slow, and it can reach heights of up to 10 meters in ideal conditions. Due to its striking appearance and unique flowering behavior, it is a popular choice for collectors and xeriscaping in dry climates."
