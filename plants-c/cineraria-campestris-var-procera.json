    "intro": "Cineraria campestris var. procera, commonly known as the tall cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and large, showy blue to violet flowers. The plant features broad, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, which help it retain moisture in its native arid environment. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The variety 'procera' is distinguished by its taller stature compared to other cineraria species."
