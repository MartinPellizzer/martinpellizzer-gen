    "intro": "Cotyledon sediformis, commonly known as the \"butterfly plant,\" is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and protect against harsh environmental conditions. Cotyledon sediformis is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
