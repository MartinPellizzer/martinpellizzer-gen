It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant a soft appearance. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. This variant is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate, mat-forming habit."
