    "intro": "Cypripedium insigne var. rubrum-marginatum, commonly known as the Red-edged Lady's Slipper, is a striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive red margin on the lip, which sets it apart from other members of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, and it produces a single, fragrant bloom each year. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this rare and beautiful orchid is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
