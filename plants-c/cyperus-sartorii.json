    "intro": "Cyperus sartorii, commonly known as the nut sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant has triangular stems and produces small, three-sided spikelets that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomes allow it to spread rapidly, making it an aggressive weed in agricultural and wetland environments. Cyperus sartorii is often found in moist soils, such as those in marshes, ditches, and rice paddies."
