It features small, waxy, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has rosettes of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically important member of the Montiaceae family."
