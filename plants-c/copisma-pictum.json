    "intro": "Copisma pictum, commonly known as the painted bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that help it remain buoyant in water. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow and are borne on slender stalks. Copisma pictum is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family and is adapted to nutrient-poor aquatic environments."
