    "intro": "Coryphantha loricata, commonly known as the Mexican ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
