It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits with a pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
