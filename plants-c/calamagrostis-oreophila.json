    "intro": "Calamagrostis oreophila, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Calamagrostis oreophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
