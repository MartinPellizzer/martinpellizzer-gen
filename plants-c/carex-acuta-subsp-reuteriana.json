It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers. This subspecies is typically found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
