    "intro": "Calystegia malacophylla subsp. malacophylla, commonly known as the waxyleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, heart-shaped leaves and large, showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports, often found in humid, tropical environments. Its flowers emit a mild fragrance and are pollinated primarily by insects. The subspecies is distinguished by its thick, waxy leaves, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat."
