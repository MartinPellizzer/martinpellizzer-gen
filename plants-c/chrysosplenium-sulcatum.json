It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, wavy-edged leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
