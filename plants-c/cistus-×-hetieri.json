    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 hetieri, commonly known as the hybrid rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The hybrid nature of Cistus \u00d7 hetieri results from crosses between different species of the Cistus genus, contributing to its genetic diversity and adaptability."
