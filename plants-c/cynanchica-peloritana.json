    "intro": "Cynanchica peloritana, commonly known as the Peloritan herb, is a climbing plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing seeds with silky hairs. It thrives in rocky and dry habitats, often found in coastal areas and limestone soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species within its native range."
