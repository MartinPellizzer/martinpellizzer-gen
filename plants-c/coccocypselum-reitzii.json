It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and small, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic and practical properties."
