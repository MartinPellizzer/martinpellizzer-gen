    "intro": "Callitriche palustris var. dubia, commonly known as the bog water-star, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds, ditches, and marshes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features delicate, floating or submersed leaves that are often oval or lance-shaped, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its small, white or pink flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variant is closely related to other members of the Callitriche genus, sharing similar morphological and ecological traits."
