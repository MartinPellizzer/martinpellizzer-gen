    "intro": "Carex stracheyi, commonly known as Strachey's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Native to parts of Asia, particularly China and India, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or grassland habitats. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
