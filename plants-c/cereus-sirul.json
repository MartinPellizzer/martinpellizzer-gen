It is a nocturnal flowering plant, producing large, fragrant white flowers that open at night. The plant has a tall, cylindrical stem with ribbed structure and spiny areoles, typical of cacti. Its flowers are short-lived, lasting only a few hours, and are pollinated by moths and bats. Cereus sirul is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
