    "intro": "Cyathea dura, commonly known as the hard tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its trunk is composed of a dense mass of root-like structures called rhizomes, which store water and nutrients. Cyathea dura plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
