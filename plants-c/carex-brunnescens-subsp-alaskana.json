    "intro": "Carex brunnescens subsp. alaskana, commonly known as Alaska sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, fens, and marshes, often in boreal or subarctic climates. The plant features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, clustered brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is adapted to cold environments and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity."
