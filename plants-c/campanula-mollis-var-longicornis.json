It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and adaptability to various garden conditions."
