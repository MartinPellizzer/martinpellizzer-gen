It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with woody stems and large, palmately lobed leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations above 1,500 meters.
