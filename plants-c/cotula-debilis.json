    "intro": "Cotula debilis, commonly known as the weak cotula, is a small, herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. The plant features small, daisy-like flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive central disc. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Cotula debilis is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions."
