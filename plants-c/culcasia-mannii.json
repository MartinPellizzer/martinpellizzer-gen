    "intro": "Culcasia mannii, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its roots are fibrous and often form dense mats, which can help stabilize sediments. Culcasia mannii is also known for its ability to absorb heavy metals from the water, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
