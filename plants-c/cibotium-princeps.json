It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of overlapping, glossy green fronds that give it a lush, tropical appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The fronds are used in traditional Hawaiian culture for ceremonial and practical purposes."
