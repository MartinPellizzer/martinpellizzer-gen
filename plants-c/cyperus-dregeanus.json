    "intro": "Cyperus dregeanus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. Cyperus dregeanus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
