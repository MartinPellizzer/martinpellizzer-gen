    "intro": "Cattleya trichopiliochila, commonly known as the pink-veined cattleya, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a pink or white color with contrasting veining. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences, and its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its striking floral display."
