It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in dense, tufted clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets that are typically arranged in a cylindrical inflorescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks.
