    "intro": "Clidemia pakaraimae, commonly known as the Pakaraima mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Venezuela and Guyana. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences of white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and has lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. It is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 800 and 1,500 meters. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species with limited distribution."
