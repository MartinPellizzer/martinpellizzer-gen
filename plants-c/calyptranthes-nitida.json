    "intro": "Calyptranthes nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf calyptranthes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, fuzzy foliage that provides a striking contrast to its small, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Calyptranthes nitida is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and ornamental appeal."
