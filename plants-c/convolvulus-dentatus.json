    "intro": "Convolvulus dentatus, commonly known as the toothed bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a purple tinge. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Convolvulus dentatus is often considered a weed due to its aggressive spreading habit."
