    "intro": "Cordia geraschanthus, commonly known as the red mangrove or mangrove apple, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive red, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by water. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often forming dense coastal forests. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cordia geraschanthus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
