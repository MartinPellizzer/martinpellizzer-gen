It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related trees. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically divided into five to seven lobes. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Capnoides lenensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
