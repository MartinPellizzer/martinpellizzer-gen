    "intro": "Carex hornschuchiana subsp. eckeroeensis, commonly known as the Eckeroeens Carex, is a perennial sedge native to specific regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wet meadows or along stream edges. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. This subspecies is relatively rare and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive."
