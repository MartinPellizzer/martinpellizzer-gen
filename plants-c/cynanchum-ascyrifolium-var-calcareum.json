    "intro": "Cynanchum ascyrifolium var. calcareum, commonly known as the limestone milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those with a high calcium content, such as limestone soils. Due to its drought tolerance and unique floral structure, it is an important plant for pollinators in its native habitat."
