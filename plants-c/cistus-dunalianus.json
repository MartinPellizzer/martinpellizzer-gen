    "intro": "Cistus dunalianus, commonly known as the Algerian rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Algeria and southern France. It is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It is often used in traditional medicine for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions makes it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
