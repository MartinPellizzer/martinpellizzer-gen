It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and attractive, finely textured leaves. The plant produces small, clustered hazelnuts that are edible and have a sweet, nutty flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ecological significance."
