    "intro": "Corbularia bulbocodium subsp. aurea, commonly known as the golden sandwort, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes or rock gardens."
