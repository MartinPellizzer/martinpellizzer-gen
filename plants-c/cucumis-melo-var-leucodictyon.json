It is characterized by its pale green, netted rind and sweet, aromatic flesh. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by bees, leading to the development of the fruit. Its leaves are broad, lobed, and covered in fine hairs, typical of the Cucurbitaceae family. The fruit is usually harvested when fully mature, offering a distinct flavor profile compared to other melon varieties."
