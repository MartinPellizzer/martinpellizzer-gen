It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Caa is often cultivated for its vibrant blossoms in shades of purple, pink, white, and blue. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for indoor gardening and container planting."
