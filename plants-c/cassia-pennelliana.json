    "intro": "Cassia pennelliana, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow, flame-like inflorescences that appear in clusters, adding vibrant color to its foliage. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in warm, humid climates. Cassia pennelliana is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking floral display."
