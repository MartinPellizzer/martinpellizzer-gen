    "intro": "Crotalaria aridicola subsp. glabrata, commonly known as the desert crown flower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The subspecies glabrata is distinguished by its smooth, hairless leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
