    "intro": "Cynanchum defilippii, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Cynanchum defilippii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
