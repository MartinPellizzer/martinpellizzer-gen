    "intro": "Cynosurus aristatus, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more prominent in dry conditions. Cynosurus aristatus is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and sandy soils."
