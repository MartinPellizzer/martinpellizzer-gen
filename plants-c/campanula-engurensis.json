    "intro": "Campanula engurensis, commonly known as the Engure bellflower, is a perennial herb native to eastern Europe and parts of Russia. It typically grows in moist, shady woodland habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens. Campanula engurensis is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
