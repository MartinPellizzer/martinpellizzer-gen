    "intro": "Castanea purpurella, commonly known as the purpleleaf chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically reddish-purple in color, especially during the growing season. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by spiny, capsule-like fruits that contain edible nuts. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental species within the Fagaceae family. Castanea purpurella thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
