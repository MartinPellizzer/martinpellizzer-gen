    "intro": "Cabralea rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stained cabralea, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually dark green and leathery, while its flowers range from pink to red, adding vibrancy to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
