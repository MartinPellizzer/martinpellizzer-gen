    "intro": "Cynorkis tenuicalcar subsp. tenuicalcar, commonly known as the narrow-shouldered cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk with a distinctive, narrow, and fluted stem. Its leaves are pinnate, with long, narrow pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. This subspecies is notable for its slow growth and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance."
