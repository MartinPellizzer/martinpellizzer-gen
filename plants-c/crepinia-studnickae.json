It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that resemble small crepe paper. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its blooming period occurs during the summer months, producing clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native region."
