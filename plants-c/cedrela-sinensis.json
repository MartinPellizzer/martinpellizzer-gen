    "intro": "Cedrela sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese cedar or yellow cedar, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and smooth, greyish bark. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
