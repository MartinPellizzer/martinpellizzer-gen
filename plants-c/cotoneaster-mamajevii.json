    "intro": "Cotoneaster mamajevii, commonly known as the Mamajev's cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features small, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Cotoneaster mamajevii is also valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand cold climates."
