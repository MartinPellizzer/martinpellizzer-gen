    "intro": "Cinchona succirubra var. conglomerata, commonly known as the red-cinnamon tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, red flowers. The plant is notable for its bark, which contains alkaloids such as quinine, historically used in the treatment of malaria. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests. Its botanical significance lies in its role in traditional medicine and its contribution to the genus Cinchona's diversity."
