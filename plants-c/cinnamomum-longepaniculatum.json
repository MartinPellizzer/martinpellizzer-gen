It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, reddish-brown fruits that contain winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Its essential oils, derived from its bark and leaves, are used in traditional medicine and as a spice."
