    "intro": "Coffea arabica var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping coffee plant, is a unique variant of the Arabica coffee species. It is characterized by its cascading, drooping branches that create a striking, ornamental appearance. This plant is native to Ethiopia and is often cultivated as a decorative shrub rather than for its coffee beans. It produces small, white flowers followed by red berries containing seeds that can be used for coffee. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil."
