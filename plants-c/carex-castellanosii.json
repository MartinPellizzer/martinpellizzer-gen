    "intro": "Carex castellanosii, commonly known as the Castellanos' sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and streamside habitats. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces viable seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Carex castellanosii is often found in high-altitude ecosystems where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
