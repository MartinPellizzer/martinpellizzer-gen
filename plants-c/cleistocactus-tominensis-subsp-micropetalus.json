    "intro": "Cleistocactus tominensis subsp. micropetalus, commonly known as the small-petalled rock cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a fine, white coating. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that open only briefly during the night, a feature typical of cleistocarps. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. This subspecies is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative cactus in arid gardens."
