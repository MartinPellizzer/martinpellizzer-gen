    "intro": "Campyloneurum madrense, commonly known as the Madre\u00f1o rock fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid microhabitats. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Campyloneurum madrense is considered a vulnerable species."
