The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with branching stems that lie close to the ground. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Cynocrambe prostrata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
