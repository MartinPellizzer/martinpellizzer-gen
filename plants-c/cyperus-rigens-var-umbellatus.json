    "intro": "Cyperus rigens var. umbellatus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense, umbrella-shaped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, making it a common sight in swampy areas and along water bodies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
