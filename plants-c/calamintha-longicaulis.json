    "intro": "Calamintha longicaulis, commonly known as long-stemmed caraway, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It features slender, upright stems that are often branched and covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense terminal clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and aromatic, with a scent reminiscent of mint and caraway. Calamintha longicaulis is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
