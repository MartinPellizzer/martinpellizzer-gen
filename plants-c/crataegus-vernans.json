    "intro": "Crataegus vernans, commonly known as the early hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that ripen in late summer, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and open areas. The early hawthorn is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
