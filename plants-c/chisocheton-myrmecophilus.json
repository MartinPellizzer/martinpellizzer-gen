    "intro": "Chisocheton myrmecophilus, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glandular leaves that secrete nectar, attracting ants that form a mutualistic relationship with the plant. The plant's structure includes specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for ant colonies. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and competing plants. Its botanical features make it an important component of forest ecosystems in its native habitat."
