    "intro": "Cuscuta indecora var. attenuata, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant is often found on various agricultural and wild plants, including grasses and legumes. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread widely. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants."
