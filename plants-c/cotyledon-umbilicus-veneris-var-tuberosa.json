    "intro": "Cotyledon umbilicus-veneris var. tuberosa, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its swollen, tuberous root system and its distinctive, fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves. The plant is known for its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements. However, it is often grafted onto a different rootstock, such as Hylocereus, to enhance its growth and flowering potential."
