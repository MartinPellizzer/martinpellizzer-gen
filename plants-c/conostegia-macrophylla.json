    "intro": "Conostegia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved wax tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it can grow up to 6 meters in height under favorable conditions. Conostegia macrophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
