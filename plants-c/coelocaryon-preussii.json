It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy surface. The flowers are small and clustered, often hidden within cup-like structures called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family."
