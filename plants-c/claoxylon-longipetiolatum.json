    "intro": "Claoxylon longipetiolatum, commonly known as the long-petioled claoxylon, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
