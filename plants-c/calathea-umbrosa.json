    "intro": "Calathea umbrosa, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with intricate patterns that change in response to light conditions. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, often displaying shades of green, silver, and pink. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Its unique leaf movements, where the leaves fold at night, contribute to its common name and make it a popular ornamental plant."
