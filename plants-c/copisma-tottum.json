    "intro": "Copisma tottum, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to excrete salt through specialized structures called salt glands. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds into the tidal waters, facilitating its dispersal in coastal ecosystems."
