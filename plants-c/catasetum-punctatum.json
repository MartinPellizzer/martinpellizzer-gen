It is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The species is noted for its unique floral structure, which plays a role in its specialized pollination mechanism."
