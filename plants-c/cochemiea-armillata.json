    "intro": "Cochemiea armillata, commonly known as the armillate cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert in North America. It is a small, slow-growing cactus that typically reaches a height of about 10 inches. The plant features a short, thick stem with numerous spiny areoles, from which both flowers and glochids (fine, barbed bristles) emerge. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, opening in the morning and closing by midday. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stem and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently."
