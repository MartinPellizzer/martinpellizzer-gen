    "intro": "Celsia scabrida, commonly known as the rough celsia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring. Its fruits are berries that turn red when mature, containing several seeds. Celsia scabrida is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is adapted to thrive in cooler, high-altitude environments."
