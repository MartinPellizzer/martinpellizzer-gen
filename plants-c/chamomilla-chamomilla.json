    "intro": "Chamomilla chamomilla, commonly known as German chamomile, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems and finely divided, feathery leaves that are aromatic and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers with white petals, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. The flowers are rich in essential oils, particularly chamazulene, which contributes to its medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and herbal cultivation."
