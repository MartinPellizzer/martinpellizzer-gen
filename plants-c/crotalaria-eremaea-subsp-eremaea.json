    "intro": "Crotalaria eremaea subsp. eremaea, commonly known as the desert crownflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species characterized by its distinctive crown-like inflorescence. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with prominent spurred petals, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in dry environments. Crotalaria eremaea subsp. eremaea is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert areas."
