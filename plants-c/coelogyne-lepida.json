It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescence that bears numerous fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees or rocks, and its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients. Its leaves are strap-like, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern. Coelogyne lepida is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its striking floral display."
