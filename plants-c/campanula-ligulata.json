    "intro": "Campanula ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland borders. Campanula ligulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
