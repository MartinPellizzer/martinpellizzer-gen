    "intro": "Cryptosorus decrescens var. blechnifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a member of the Hederaceae family. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive frond structure. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is noted for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
