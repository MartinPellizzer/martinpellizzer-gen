It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers are usually pink to red, with bracts that form a surrounding ring, and it produces small, elongated achenes as fruits. Centaurea fajvuschii is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
