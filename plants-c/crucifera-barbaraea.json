    "intro": "Crucifera barbaraea, commonly known as bittercress, is a species of flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions across Europe and Asia. Its seeds are enclosed in a siliqua, a dry, dehiscent fruit typical of the mustard family. The plant is known for its peppery taste, which is due to the presence of glucosinolates."
