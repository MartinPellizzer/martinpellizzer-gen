    "intro": "Cassia exaltata, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, fern-like leaves and striking clusters of bright orange to red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cassia exaltata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to flourish."
