    "intro": "Cynomorium, commonly known as the death cap or the Egyptian henbane, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are characterized by their fleshy, often succulent stems and leaves, which help them survive in arid environments. They typically produce small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the species. Cynomorium species are native to regions of Eurasia, particularly in the Mediterranean and Middle East. Some species are used in traditional medicine, although they can be toxic if ingested."
