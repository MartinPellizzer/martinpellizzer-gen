    "intro": "Calophyllum costulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf calophyllum, is a tropical tree native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Its bark and leaves have been used traditionally in some cultures for their medicinal properties. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its timber."
