    "intro": "Cirsium rosulatum, commonly known as the rosette thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense rosette of spiny, gray-green leaves that form a compact cluster near the ground. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear purple to pinkish flowers in late summer. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a distinctive, serrated edge. Cirsium rosulatum is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions."
