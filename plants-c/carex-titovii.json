    "intro": "Carex titovii, commonly known as Titov's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern Europe and western Siberia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in peat bogs and along the edges of water bodies. Carex titovii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
