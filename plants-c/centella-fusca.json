    "intro": "Centella fusca, commonly known as the small centella or lesser centella, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of small white or pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Centella fusca is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
