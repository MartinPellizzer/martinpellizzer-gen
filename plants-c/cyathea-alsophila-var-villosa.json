    "intro": "Cyathea alsophila var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a dense, fibrous layer of old leaf bases. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, giving it a distinctive, elegant appearance. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing cones, are typically found at the base of the fronds. This varietal form is notable for its hairy texture on the trunk, which distinguishes it from other Cyathea species."
