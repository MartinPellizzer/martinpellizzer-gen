    "intro": "Chaetocarpus oblongatus var. subenervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined sea holly, is a coastal plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in intertidal zones. The leaves are narrow and have few veins, giving the plant its varietal name \"subenervis.\" It is typically found in temperate regions along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. This species plays a role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
