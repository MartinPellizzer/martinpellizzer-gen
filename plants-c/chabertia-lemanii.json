    "intro": "Chabertia lemanii, commonly known as the Leman's chabertia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. The plant features slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy. Its flowers are clustered in panicles and are usually white or pale green, giving it a delicate appearance. Chabertia lemanii is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its ecological niche and limited distribution."
