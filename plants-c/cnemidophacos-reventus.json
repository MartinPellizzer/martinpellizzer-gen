    "intro": "Cnemidophacos reventus, commonly known as the red sea lettuce, is a species of green algae belonging to the family Ulvaceae. It is characterized by its bright red or orange pigmentation, which is due to the presence of phycoerythrin, a pigment that allows it to absorb light at deeper water depths. This algae typically grows in marine environments, forming dense, gelatinous mats on rocky substrates. It plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters make it both ecologically significant and occasionally problematic in aquatic environments."
