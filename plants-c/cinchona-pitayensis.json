    "intro": "Cinchona pitayensis, commonly known as the Yucatan quinine tree, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen, small to medium-sized tree structure. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is known for its historical use in the production of quinine, though it is less commercially significant than other cinchona species. The leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth surface and dark green color."
