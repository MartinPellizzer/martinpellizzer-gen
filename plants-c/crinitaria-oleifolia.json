    "intro": "Crinitaria oleifolia, commonly known as the oilleaf balsa, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is known for its lightweight, spongy wood that is highly buoyant. Crinitaria oleifolia thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological and horticultural study."
