It is characterized by its silvery-white, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. It is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is relatively rare in cultivation."
