    "intro": "Cryptolappa affinis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cryptolappa, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. This perennial herb typically grows in moist, temperate regions, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a distinctive, finely toothed margin, and the flowers are small and clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, dark-colored fruits that are dispersed by wind. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
