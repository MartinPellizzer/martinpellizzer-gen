    "intro": "Cerastium semidecandrum var. sennenii, commonly known as the creeping snowbell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. This variety is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
