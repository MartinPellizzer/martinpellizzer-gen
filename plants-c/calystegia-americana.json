    "intro": "Calystegia americana, commonly known as the American morning glory, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a herbaceous vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that open in the morning and close by midday. Its seeds are enclosed in a spirally twisted capsule that opens to release the seeds. Calystegia americana is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
