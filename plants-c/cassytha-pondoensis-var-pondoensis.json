    "intro": "Cassytha pondoensis var. pondoensis, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using its yellow, thread-like stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its ability to photosynthesize through its stems. Cassytha pondoensis var. pondoensis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where it can parasitize a variety of host species."
