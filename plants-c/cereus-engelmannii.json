    "intro": "Cereus engelmannii, commonly known as the Engelmann's night bloomer, is a cacti species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are typically ribbed and covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, usually in shades of white or pale yellow. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its striking appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and botanical collections."
