    "intro": "Chromolaena caldensis, commonly known as the curly dock, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, which are typical of the daisy family. Chromolaena caldensis is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora."
