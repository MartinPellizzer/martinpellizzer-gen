    "intro": "Columnea schimpffii, commonly known as the Schimpff's flame or Schimpff's slipper, is a flowering plant native to the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, clinging to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with a glossy surface that helps in photosynthesis in high-altitude environments. Columnea schimpffii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in shaded, humid conditions."
