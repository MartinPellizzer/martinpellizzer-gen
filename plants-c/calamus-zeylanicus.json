    "intro": "Calamus zeylanicus, commonly known as the Ceylon calamus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, followed by the development of cylindrical, clustered fruits. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their aromatic properties and are used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. Calamus zeylanicus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and lowland forests."
