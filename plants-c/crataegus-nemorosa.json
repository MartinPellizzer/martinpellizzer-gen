    "intro": "Crataegus nemorosa, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red or orange berries that ripen in late summer, providing food for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus nemorosa is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in both gardens and natural habitats."
