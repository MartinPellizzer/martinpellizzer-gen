    "intro": "Ciconium fulgens, commonly known as the golden torch fern, is a striking epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its tall, branched fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The fronds are adorned with bright yellow spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered along the undersides of the leaves. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its unique appearance and vibrant color make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical climates."
