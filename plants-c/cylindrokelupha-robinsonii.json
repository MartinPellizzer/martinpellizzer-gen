    "intro": "Cylindrokelupha robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's cylinder-fruit, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique cylindrical fruit structure, which contains a single, large seed encased in a thick, fibrous outer layer. The plant exhibits a climbing habit, using its aerial roots to anchor itself to tree trunks and other vertical surfaces. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat fragmentation."
