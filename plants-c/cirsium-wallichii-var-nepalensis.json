    "intro": "Cirsium wallichii var. nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is a perennial herb characterized by its spiny, upright stems and basal rosettes of gray-green, fuzzy leaves. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in composite inflorescences, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing at high elevations with poor soil conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
