    "intro": "Crassula elongata, commonly known as the \"string of pearls\" or \"bead plant,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical leaves that form a trailing or upright growth habit, often resembling strings of beads. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red during the spring or summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for xeriscaping. Crassula elongata is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
