    "intro": "Columnea lanata var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly columnea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or vine, often climbing or trailing along supports. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds, which are attracted to its bright colors and nectar-rich blooms. The plant prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
