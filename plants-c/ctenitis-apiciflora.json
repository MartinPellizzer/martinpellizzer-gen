    "intro": "Ctenitis apiciflora, commonly known as the spike-fruited fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces distinctive, cone-like structures called strobili at the tips of its fronds, which contain the spores for reproduction. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and enabling it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Ctenitis apiciflora is often found in humid rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological importance."
