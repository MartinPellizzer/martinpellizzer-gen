    "intro": "Capsella oviculata, commonly known as the heartweed or smallheart. It is a flowering plant species native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule, which splits open to release the seeds. Capsella oviculata is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
