    "intro": "Cymbopogon tortilis, commonly known as the curly grass or mountain grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, slightly curled leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often arranged in a compact, cylindrical shape. Cymbopogon tortilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
