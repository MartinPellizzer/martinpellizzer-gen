    "intro": "Cuscuta leiolepis, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless branches. The plant attaches to its host using specialized haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is often found on a variety of herbaceous plants, including grasses and forbs. Cuscuta leiolepis is native to North America and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
