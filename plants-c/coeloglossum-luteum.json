    "intro": "Coeloglossum luteum, commonly known as the golden twayblade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette, and it lacks true leaves in the traditional sense, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. Coeloglossum luteum is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil."
