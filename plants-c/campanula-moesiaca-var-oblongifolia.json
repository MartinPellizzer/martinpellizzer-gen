It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet. The leaves are lanceolate, with a slightly rough texture, and the plant thrives in well-drained, moist soils. It is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats, preferring partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
