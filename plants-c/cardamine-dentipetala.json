    "intro": "Cardamine dentipetala, commonly known as the toothed watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of pinnately divided, toothed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in wet soils, often found along stream banks and in shaded woodlands. Cardamine dentipetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
