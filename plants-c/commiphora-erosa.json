    "intro": "Commiphora erosa, commonly known as the smooth myrrh tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh-producing species. The plant is characterized by its smooth, fissured bark and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces a resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and incense. The plant's botanical features make it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments."
