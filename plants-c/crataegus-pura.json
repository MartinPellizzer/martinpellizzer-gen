    "intro": "Crataegus pura, commonly known as the pure hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus pura is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, and it has a compact, bushy growth habit. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins and a dark green upper surface."
