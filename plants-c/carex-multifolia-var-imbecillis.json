    "intro": "Carex multifolia var. imbecillis, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marshy habitats. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, which are usually borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and prefers partial to full shade. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective groundcover in aquatic and semi-aquatic environments."
