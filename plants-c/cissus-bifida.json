    "intro": "Cissus bifida, commonly known as the African snow vine, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by distinctive, waxy, translucent berries. Its stems are often covered in small, glandular hairs, and it is known for its ability to climb using tendrils. Cissus bifida is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental qualities."
