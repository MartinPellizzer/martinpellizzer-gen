It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and glossy. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Cystopteris acuta is often found growing on rocks or soil in moist, shaded environments. It is a hardy plant that is commonly used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
