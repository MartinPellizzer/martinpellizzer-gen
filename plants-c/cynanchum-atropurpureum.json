It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across various regions. The plant has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
