    "intro": "Cordobia, commonly known as the desert willow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in summer, producing vibrant yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Cordobia is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its rapid growth and adaptability to harsh environments make it a resilient addition to desert landscapes."
