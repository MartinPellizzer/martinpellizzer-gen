    "intro": "Coryphopteris castanea, commonly known as the chestnut fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, round sori located on the underside of the fronds. Coryphopteris castanea plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
