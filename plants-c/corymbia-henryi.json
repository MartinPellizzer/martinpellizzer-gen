    "intro": "Corymbia henryi, commonly known as the Sydney red gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has lance-shaped leaves that are often glaucous underneath. Its flowers are arranged in clusters and are typically pink to red in color, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The wood of Corymbia henryi is hard and durable, making it valuable for timber and furniture production."
