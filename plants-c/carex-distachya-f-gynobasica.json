    "intro": "Carex distachya f. gynobasica, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a variant of the common sedges, characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. This subspecies is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist environments and support local biodiversity."
