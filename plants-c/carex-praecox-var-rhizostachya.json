    "intro": "Carex praecox var. rhizostachya, commonly known as the early sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, grasses, and reeds. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-ranked spikelets, which are wind-pollinated."
