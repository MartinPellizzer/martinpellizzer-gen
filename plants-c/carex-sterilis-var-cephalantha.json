    "intro": "Carex sterilis var. cephalantha, commonly known as the slender flat sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly curled at the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of small, spike-like flowers. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in poorly drained soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
