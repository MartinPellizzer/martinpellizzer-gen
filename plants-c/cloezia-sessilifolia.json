    "intro": "Cloezia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf cloezia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features basal leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are typically broad and lobed. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Cloezia sessilifolia is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
