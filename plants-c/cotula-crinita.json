    "intro": "Cotula crinita, commonly known as the hairy daisy or white daisies, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system and a sprawling habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat, daisy-like heads, which bloom from spring to early summer. Cotula crinita thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
