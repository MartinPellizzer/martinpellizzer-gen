    "intro": "Carapa akuri, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody pods containing edible seeds. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense, buttressed root system that helps it thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its bark is thick and fibrous, providing some resistance to pests and diseases. The plant plays a significant ecological role in supporting biodiversity within its native habitat."
