It is characterized by its showy, white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in clusters, typically in spring. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. The Chinese snowbell is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
