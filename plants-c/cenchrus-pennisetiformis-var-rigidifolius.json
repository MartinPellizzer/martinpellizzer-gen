    "intro": "Cenchrus pennisetiformis var. rigidifolius, commonly known as rigid foliaceous grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, rigid leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it a valuable species for erosion control and livestock forage. Its botanical features make it well-suited for restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
