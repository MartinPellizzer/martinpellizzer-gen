    "intro": "Crataegus seducta, commonly known as the seductive hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, simple ovate leaves, and clusters of white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus seducta is often found in open woods, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas, thriving in a variety of soil types. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
