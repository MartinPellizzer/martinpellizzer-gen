    "intro": "Chaerophyllum lucidum, commonly known as the shining hogweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that attract pollinators like bees and flies. The leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, giving them a shiny appearance, which is reflected in its common name."
