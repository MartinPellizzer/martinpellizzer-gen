    "intro": "Calamagrostis stricta var. humilior, commonly known as the dwarf reedgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to northern Europe. It typically reaches a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers in late summer, which are often tinged with purple or pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
