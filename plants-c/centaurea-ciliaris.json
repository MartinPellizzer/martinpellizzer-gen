    "intro": "Centaurea ciliaris, commonly known as the slender centaury, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant features slender stems and small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are linear and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Centaurea ciliaris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
