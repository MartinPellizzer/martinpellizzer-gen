    "intro": "Crataegus splendida, commonly known as the showy crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that appear in early spring, followed by attractive red or yellow fruits in the fall. The plant has compound leaves with 5 to 9 leaflets, and its bark is usually smooth with a reddish or grayish color. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The fruits are edible but often used more for their ornamental value than for consumption."
