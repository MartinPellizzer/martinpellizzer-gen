    "intro": "Cambessedesia harleyi, commonly known as the Harley's Cambessedesia, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a legume pod containing several elliptical seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
