    "intro": "Cerastium pentandrum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, giving it a fluffy appearance. The plant has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, rounded fruits called achenes. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Cerastium pentandrum is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
