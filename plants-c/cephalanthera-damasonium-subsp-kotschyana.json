    "intro": "Cephalanthera damasonium subsp. kotschyana, commonly known as the Kotschyan's early gentian, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Alps. It is characterized by its striking, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a tuberous root system and thrives in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous regions. It is a perennial herb with lance-shaped leaves and a slender, erect stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
