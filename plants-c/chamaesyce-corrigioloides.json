It typically thrives in wet, sandy soils along the coastlines and in marshy areas. The plant has smooth, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its small, yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. Chamaesyce corrigioloides is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and periodic flooding."
