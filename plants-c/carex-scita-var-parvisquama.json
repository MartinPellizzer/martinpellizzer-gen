    "intro": "Carex scita var. parvisquama, commonly known as the small-leaved sedges, is a species of sedge native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers. This plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. It has a clumping growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects. The leaves are usually a bluish-green color, and the plant is relatively low maintenance once established."
