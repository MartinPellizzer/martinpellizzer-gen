    "intro": "Coniogramme guizhouensis, commonly known as the Guizhou coniogramme, is a rare and endemic fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that display a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
