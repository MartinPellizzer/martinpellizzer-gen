    "intro": "Columnea purpureovittata, commonly known as the Purple-striped Flamebine, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or trailing vine, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds, which are attracted to its nectar-rich blooms. Columnea purpureovittata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
