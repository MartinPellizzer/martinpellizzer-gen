    "intro": "Campanula garganica subsp. fenestrellata, commonly known as the fenestrated bellflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe, particularly Italy and parts of the Balkans. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland margins or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf fenestrations, which are small openings that give it its common name."
