    "intro": "Calonema voigtii, commonly known as the velvetleaf calonema, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is a small, evergreen shrub native to Madagascar, characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom during the warmer months. Calonema voigtii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its compact size and ornamental appeal."
