    "intro": "Chrysogrammitis glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular feather moss, is a species of moss that belongs to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like leaves that are often covered in small, glandular structures. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on slender stalks and release spores for propagation. The glandular features of its leaves may play a role in water retention and protection against herbivores."
