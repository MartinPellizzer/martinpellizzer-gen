    "intro": "Centaurium estremerae, commonly known as the Estremaduran centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing herb with slender, hairy stems and small, bright blue to purple flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils, often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
