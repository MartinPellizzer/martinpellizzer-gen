    "intro": "Cymbicarpos trigonus, commonly known as the three-lobed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in desert and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive three-lobed seed pods. Its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. Cymbicarpos trigonus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing sandy soils in native landscapes."
