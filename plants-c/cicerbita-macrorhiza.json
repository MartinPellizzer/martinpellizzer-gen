    "intro": "Cicerbita macrorhiza, commonly known as the large-rooted bittercress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in moist, disturbed soils. Its roots are fibrous and can be somewhat fleshy, contributing to its common name. Cicerbita macrorhiza is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in other open, sunny habitats."
