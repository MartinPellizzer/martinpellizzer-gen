    "intro": "Crocus kotschyanus subsp. hakkariensis, commonly known as the Hakkari crocus, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It is a perennial bulbous plant that produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
