    "intro": "Chamagrostis verna, commonly known as early green oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences in early spring. Chamagrostis verna is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
