    "intro": "Cereus thurberi var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal night bloomer, is a succulent cactus native to the coastal regions of Baja California, Mexico. It features a tall, branching structure with spiny stems that are adapted to thrive in arid, coastal environments. The plant produces striking white flowers at night, which are often fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system suited for sandy soils. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging climates."
