    "intro": "Cyphia erecta f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf cyphia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features small, leathery leaves that are arranged in a dense, compact form, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
