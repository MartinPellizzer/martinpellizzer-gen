    "intro": "Critoniopsis villaregalis, commonly known as the Peruvian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are ovate and have a slightly hairy texture, while its fruits are small berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Due to its toxic properties, it is not suitable for human consumption but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
