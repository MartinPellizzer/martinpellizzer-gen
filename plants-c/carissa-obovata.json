    "intro": "Carissa obovata, commonly known as the yellow bell tree, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves and clusters of yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible but have a mild, tangy flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Carissa obovata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
