    "intro": "Chaetochlamys panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian chaetochlamys, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks or in dense undergrowth. Its leaves are simple and ovate, with a smooth texture, while its flowers display vibrant colors, often in shades of red and yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
