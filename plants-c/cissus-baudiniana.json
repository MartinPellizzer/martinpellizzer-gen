    "intro": "Cissus baudiniana, commonly known as the rock fig or African ice plant, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices. Cissus baudiniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
