    "intro": "Corydalis fabacea var. obesa, commonly known as the fat-leaf corydalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are broader and more rounded compared to other varieties of Corydalis. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its unique foliage and ornamental flowers, it is a valued addition to native plant collections."
