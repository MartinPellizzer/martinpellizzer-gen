    "intro": "Carex obesa var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf swamp sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly glossy. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance."
