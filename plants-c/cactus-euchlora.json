    "intro": "Cactus euchlora, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. The plant features spiny stems and produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, a characteristic adaptation to conserve water in harsh environments. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds, aiding in its dispersal by animals."
