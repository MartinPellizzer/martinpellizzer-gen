    "intro": "Calamagrostis neglecta var. elatior, commonly known as the tall bluejoint grass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and panicles of blue-gray flowers that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that contributes to its ornamental appeal. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
