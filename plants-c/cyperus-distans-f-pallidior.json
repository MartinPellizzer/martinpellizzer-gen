    "intro": "Cyperus distans f. pallidior, commonly known as the pale flatsedge, is a variant of the flatsedge plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along waterways. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green to brown in color. Its inflorescence is a dense spike that can be mistaken for other sedges due to its similar appearance. This plant plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
