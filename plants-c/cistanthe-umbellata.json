    "intro": "Cistanthe umbellata, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in dense clusters. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep moisture sources. Cistanthe umbellata is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
