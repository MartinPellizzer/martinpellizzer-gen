    "intro": "Coccinia sessilifolia var. sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf groundcherries, is a species of flowering plant in the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are edible when ripe. The leaves are heart-shaped with a smooth margin and are often sessile, meaning they lack a petiole. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruits in some parts of the world."
