    "intro": "Camaridium imbricatum, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep taproot system, making it difficult to eradicate once established. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and along roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
