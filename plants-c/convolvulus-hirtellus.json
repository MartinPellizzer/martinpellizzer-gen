    "intro": "Convolvulus hirtellus, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, winding stems that twine around supporting structures. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue to violet in color, blooming in the morning. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The hairy morning glory is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun."
