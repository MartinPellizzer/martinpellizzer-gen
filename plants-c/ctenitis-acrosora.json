    "intro": "Ctenitis acrosora, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous small, finger-like segments. This plant is native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with rocky or sandy soils. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on cliffs or in forest understories. The fronds are usually evergreen, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds."
