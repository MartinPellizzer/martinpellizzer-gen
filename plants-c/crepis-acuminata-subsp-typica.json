    "intro": "Crepis acuminata subsp. typica, commonly known as the narrowleaf mouse-ear, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy habitats, such as meadows and woodland edges, and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single head, which are borne on slender, hairy stems. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, hollow pappus that aids in wind dispersal. Crepis acuminata subsp. typica is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of certain ecological communities."
