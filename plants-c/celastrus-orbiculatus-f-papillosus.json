It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are often glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It is native to Asia but has been introduced to North America, where it can become invasive. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions make it a notable species in ecological studies."
