    "intro": "Conyza nitida, commonly known as slenderleaf horseweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, hairy stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom from summer to autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Conyza nitida is part of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and wind-pollinated flowers."
