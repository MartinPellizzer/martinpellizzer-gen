    "intro": "Cestrum elegantissimum, commonly known as the elegant cestrum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun exposure. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and pleasant evening fragrance."
