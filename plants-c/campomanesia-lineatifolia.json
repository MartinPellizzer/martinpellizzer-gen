    "intro": "Campomanesia lineatifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree or lulo, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features elliptical, glossy leaves with a smooth texture and a distinctive linear vein pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, citrus-like fruits. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for humid, tropical climates. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
