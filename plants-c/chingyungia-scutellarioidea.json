    "intro": "Chingyungia scutellarioidea, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and distinctive golden-colored fronds that contrast with its dark green base. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
