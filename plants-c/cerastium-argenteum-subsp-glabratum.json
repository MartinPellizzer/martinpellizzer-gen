    "intro": "Cerastium argenteum subsp. glabratum, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, silver-green leaves that are often described as velvety to the touch. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden use in shaded areas."
