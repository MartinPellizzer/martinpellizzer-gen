    "intro": "Cerastium bambuseti var. inferalpinum, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers and trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This variant is native to the alpine regions of Europe and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
