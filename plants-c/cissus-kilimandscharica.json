    "intro": "Cissus kilimandscharica, commonly known as the rock fig or African snowball, is a climbing plant native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, giving it its common name. Its ability to thrive in rocky and arid environments makes it well adapted to harsh conditions. Cissus kilimandscharica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
