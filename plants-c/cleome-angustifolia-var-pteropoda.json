    "intro": "Cleome angustifolia var. pteropoda, commonly known as the narrowleaf cleome, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil. It thrives in full sun and is known for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
