    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 jetibaensis, commonly known as the Jetibaensis Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid that originated from crosses between Cattleya labiata and Cattleya guttata. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and sometimes feature a yellow throat. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and floral development. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is prized for its beauty and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and floral arrangements."
