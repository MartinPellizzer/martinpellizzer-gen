    "intro": "Collomia soehrensii, commonly known as the Sierra snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Pink Family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
