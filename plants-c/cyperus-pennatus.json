    "intro": "Cyperus pennatus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces distinctive, umbrella-shaped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, pond edges, and damp soils. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in wetland habitats. Cyperus pennatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a landscape plant."
