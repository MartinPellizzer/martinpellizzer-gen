    "intro": "Cratoxylum ligustrinum, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline environments, making it a key species in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Cratoxylum ligustrinum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
