    "intro": "Campanula sibirica subsp. longistyla, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, slender corolla, which sets it apart from other campanula species. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
