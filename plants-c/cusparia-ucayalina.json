    "intro": "Cusparia ucayalina, commonly known as the Amazonian grass or the Ucayali grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, thriving in the humid and warm climate of the Amazon Basin. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like in appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, producing lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its ecological significance, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
