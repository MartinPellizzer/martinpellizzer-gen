    "intro": "Cerasus chamaecerasus var. umbraculifera, commonly known as the shade cherry or umbra cherry, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental hedges or as a specimen plant in gardens. Due to its slow growth and hardy nature, it is well-suited for cooler climates."
