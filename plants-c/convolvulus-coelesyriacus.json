It is a sprawling annual vine with opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant has hairy stems and is often found in dry, rocky soils. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, which includes other morning glory-like plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily in disturbed environments."
