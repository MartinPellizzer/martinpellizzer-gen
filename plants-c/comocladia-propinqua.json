    "intro": "Comocladia propinqua, commonly known as the dwarf mangrove, is a small, evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It thrives in brackish or saltwater environments, often found in mangrove forests and tidal zones. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various birds and animals. Comocladia propinqua plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial life."
