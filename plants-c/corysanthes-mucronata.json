    "intro": "Corysanthes mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ghost orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Australia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with slender leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on tree branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale green, bloom in summer and attract specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
