    "intro": "Chenopodium suffruticosum subsp. remotum, commonly known as desert spinach, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, known as a bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are edible and have a slightly salty, nutty flavor, making it a traditional food source for some indigenous communities. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability."
