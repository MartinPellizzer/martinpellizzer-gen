    "intro": "Corydalis bulbosa var. rotundiloba, commonly known as the round-leaf Corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tuberous root system and delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The leaves are rounded and often have a waxy texture, which helps the plant conserve moisture in its natural habitat. This variety is part of the Fumariaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories."
