    "intro": "Calamus unifarius, commonly known as the single-leaf calamus, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is a tall, slender grass-like plant that can grow up to several meters in height, characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a single row along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or pale yellow, followed by spiky, three-lobed fruits. Calamus unifarius is often found in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical significance lies in its ecological role within its native ecosystems."
