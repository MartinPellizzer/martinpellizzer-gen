    "intro": "Carex luctuosa, commonly known as the weeping sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Carex luctuosa plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
