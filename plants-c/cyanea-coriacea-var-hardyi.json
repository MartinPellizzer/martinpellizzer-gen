    "intro": "Cyanea coriacea var. hardyi, commonly known as the hardy coral tree, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like stems and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The leaves are typically thick and leathery, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. This variant is more cold-tolerant than the typical Cyanea coriacea, making it suitable for cultivation in subtropical climates. Its ornamental value comes from its striking floral display and unique foliage."
