    "intro": "Clinopodium atlanticum, commonly known as Atlantic mint, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in saline and well-drained conditions. The plant features slender, aromatic leaves and produces small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal remedies for its purported calming and digestive properties. Clinopodium atlanticum is also valued for its role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
