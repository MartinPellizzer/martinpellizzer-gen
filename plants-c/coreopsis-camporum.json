It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems and bright yellow flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces numerous small, daisy-like blooms from late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant choice for native gardens. Coreopsis camporum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
