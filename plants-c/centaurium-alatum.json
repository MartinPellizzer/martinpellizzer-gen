    "intro": "Centaurium alatum, commonly known as the winged chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, ascending stems that are covered with fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its overall texture. Centaurium alatum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
