It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flower heads that are surrounded by bracts. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, while its stems are upright and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Centaurea bolleana is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
