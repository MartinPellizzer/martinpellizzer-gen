    "intro": "Camellia theiformis, commonly known as the threadleaf camellia, is a species native to southern China. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, camellia-like flowers in shades of red, pink, and white during late winter to early spring. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade. Camellia theiformis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
