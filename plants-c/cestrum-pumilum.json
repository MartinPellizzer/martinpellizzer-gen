    "intro": "Cestrum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf nightshade, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but can be toxic if consumed in large quantities. Cestrum pumilum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for gardens in warmer climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant flowers and compact growth habit."
