It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant orange-red bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically hidden within the showy bracts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Candollea tetrandra is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to bloom throughout the year under proper care."
