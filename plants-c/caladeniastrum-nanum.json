    "intro": "Caladeniastrum nanum, commonly known as the dwarf spider orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features a slender, hairy stem and produces delicate, spider-like flowers in shades of pink and white. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, usually from late autumn to early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
