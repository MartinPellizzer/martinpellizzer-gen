    "intro": "Crataegus diffusa, commonly known as the diffuse hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 centimeters long and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grey, becoming fissured with age, and it often has thorny branches. Crataegus diffusa is valued in ecological landscapes for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in supporting local wildlife."
