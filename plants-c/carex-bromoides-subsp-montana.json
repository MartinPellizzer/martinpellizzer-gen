    "intro": "Carex bromoides subsp. montana, commonly known as mountain sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested or open habitats. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered at the ends of its stems. Mountain sedge is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
