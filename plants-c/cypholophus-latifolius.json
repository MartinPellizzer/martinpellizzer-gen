    "intro": "Cypholophus latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf cypholophus, is a flowering plant species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and biodiversity."
