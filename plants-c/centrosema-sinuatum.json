    "intro": "Centrosema sinuatum, commonly known as the pink leadplant, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep root system, which helps it thrive in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen. Its foliage and flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
