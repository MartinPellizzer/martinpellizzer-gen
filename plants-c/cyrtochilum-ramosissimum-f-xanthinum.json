    "intro": "Cyrtochilum ramosissimum f. xanthinum, commonly known as the golden-stem orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow-green foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its pale yellow to white flowers. The plant features elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are typically clustered in small inflorescences, with petals and sepals that are intricately shaped and often adorned with subtle markings. This orchid thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas at high altitudes."
