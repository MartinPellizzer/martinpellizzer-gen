    "intro": "Canarium warburgianum, commonly known as the African snowberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually glabrous. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by berries that are typically white or pale green when immature and turn red when mature. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
