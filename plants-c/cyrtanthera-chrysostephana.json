    "intro": "Cyrtanthera chrysostephana, commonly known as the golden stephania, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or a terrestrial herb, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are ovate and often have a waxy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Cyrtanthera chrysostephana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
