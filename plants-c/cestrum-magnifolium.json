    "intro": "Cestrum magnifolium, commonly known as the sweet shrub or night-blooming jasmine, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring glossy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The flowers bloom at night, releasing a strong, sweet scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a bitter taste. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
