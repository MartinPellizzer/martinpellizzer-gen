    "intro": "Cyrtophyllum, commonly known as the waxflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Santalaceae. These plants are characterized by their evergreen shrubs or small trees, often with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cyrtophyllum species are native to regions of Africa, Madagascar, and parts of Asia, where they thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. The flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying vibrant colors that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to their ornamental value and adaptability, some species are cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
