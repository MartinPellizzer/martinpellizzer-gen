    "intro": "Coryphopteris gymnopoda var. humilis, commonly known as the lowland huperzia, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and finely divided, lanceolate leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, helping it anchor in soil and absorb nutrients. The leaves are usually evergreen, providing a consistent green appearance throughout the year."
