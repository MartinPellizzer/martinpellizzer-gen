    "intro": "Cleistes idroboi, commonly known as the Brazilian bellflower, is a rare and striking orchid native to Brazil. It is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive hood-like structure. The plant has a compact growth habit and produces few, showy blooms that appear in late spring or early summer. Its flowers emit a sweet, vanilla-like fragrance, which attracts specific pollinators such as moths and bees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cleistes idroboi is considered a conservation concern."
