    "intro": "Cyrtorchis brownii, commonly known as the Brown's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically display a combination of white, green, and brown hues. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air, which is essential for its survival in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyrtorchis brownii is considered a vulnerable species."
