    "intro": "Crotalaria tenuifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and palmate leaves. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural areas. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and can be used as a forage crop, though the plant contains toxic compounds that require careful handling. Crotalaria tenuifolia is also noted for its role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility."
