    "intro": "Catasetum heteranthum, commonly known as the orchid with the unique floral structure, is a species native to Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its specialized flowers that feature a distinctive column and lip. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a bilaterally symmetrical shape, often with a contrasting coloration between the dorsal and ventral sides. Its flowers are adapted for specific pollination by bees, with the lip serving as a landing platform. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments."
