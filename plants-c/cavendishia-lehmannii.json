    "intro": "Cavendishia lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's Cavendish, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are borne in clusters and are often used in ornamental gardening due to their vibrant appearance. Cavendishia lehmannii is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
