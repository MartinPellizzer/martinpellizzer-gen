It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has thin, spreading stems that often lie close to the ground, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
