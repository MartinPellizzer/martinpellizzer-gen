    "intro": "Conyza diffusa, commonly known as common cudweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Americas. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs and produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow central disks and white ray florets. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, thriving in a variety of soil types. Conyza diffusa is known for its ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds, making it a common weed in agricultural and natural areas."
