    "intro": "Cipadessa baccifera var. integerrima, commonly known as the red sanders, is a rare and valuable species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly prized for its unique color and durability. The plant is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 15 meters in height, with a dense canopy of lanceolate leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-yellow in color, while the fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is classified as critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
