    "intro": "Chrysosplenium qinlingense, commonly known as Qinling golden spleen, is a rare flowering plant native to the Qinling Mountains in China. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
