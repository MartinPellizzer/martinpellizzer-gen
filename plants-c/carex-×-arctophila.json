    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 arctophila, commonly known as the Arctic sedge, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is often found in moist, temperate environments. The plant typically grows in wet meadows, bogs, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. The inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, greenish flowers, which are wind-pollinated."
