It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or slopes. Due to its unique habitat and appearance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
