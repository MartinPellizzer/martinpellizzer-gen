    "intro": "Colchicum bivonae subsp. euboeum, commonly known as the Euboean colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Aegean region of Greece. It is characterized by its striking purple to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, often in open woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species."
