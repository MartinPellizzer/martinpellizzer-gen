    "intro": "Caltha palustris f. minor, commonly known as the lesser marsh marigold, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetlands and moist meadows in northern regions. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in acidic, waterlogged soils and is often found in bogs and along stream banks. This botanical variant is smaller than the typical Caltha palustris, with shorter stems and smaller flowers."
