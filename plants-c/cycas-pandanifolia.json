    "intro": "Cycas pandanifolia, commonly known as the pandan-like cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that resemble the fronds of the pandan plant. The leaves are typically green with a waxy texture and can grow up to several meters in length. This cycad produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Cycas pandanifolia is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
