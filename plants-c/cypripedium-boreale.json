    "intro": "Cypripedium boreale, commonly known as the northern lady's slipper, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy orchid-like flowers that are typically pink or white with a pouch-shaped lip. The plant has a short, stout rhizome and produces broad, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette. Cypripedium boreale thrives in cool, moist environments such as bogs and coniferous forests. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, making it an important component of its ecological community."
