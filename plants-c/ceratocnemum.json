    "intro": "Ceratocnemum, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa and consists of several species, including Ceratocnemum corymbosum and Ceratocnemum parvifolium. These plants are characterized by their compact growth habit, with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and the plants are often used in rock gardens or as ornamental plants due to their hardy nature and attractive blooms. Ceratocnemum species are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making them resilient to drought conditions."
