    "intro": "Coleostephus paludosus, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces striking blue or purple flowers in late summer. Its flowers are tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
