    "intro": "Carpobrotus, commonly known as ice plant, is a succulent plant native to coastal areas of South Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant pink or orange flowers, typically in the spring or summer. Its unique ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it ecologically significant in coastal regions. Carpobrotus is also popular in horticulture for its hardiness and ornamental value."
