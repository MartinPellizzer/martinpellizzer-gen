It is characterized by its erect, glandular-stemmed growth and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The subspecies funerea is distinguished by its darker, more elongated stems and leaves compared to other subspecies. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the study of plant adaptations to arid environments."
