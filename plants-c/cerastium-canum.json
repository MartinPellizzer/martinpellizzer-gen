    "intro": "Cerastium canum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically heart-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Cerastium canum is known for its ability to spread rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats that can suppress other vegetation."
