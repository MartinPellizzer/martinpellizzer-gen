    "intro": "Cyclodium abbreviatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf cyclodium, is a small, annual herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited water availability. Cyclodium abbreviatum is often found in sandy or rocky soils and plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
