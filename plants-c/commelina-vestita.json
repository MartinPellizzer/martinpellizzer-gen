    "intro": "Commelina vestita, commonly known as the white-veined spiderwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, delicate blue or violet flowers with three petals and three sepals, typical of the Commelina genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, shade-tolerant plant."
