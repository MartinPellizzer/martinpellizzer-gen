    "intro": "Cirsium eriophorum var. platyonychium, commonly known as the broad-nail thistle, is a perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pinkish-purple flower heads, which are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a spherical shape. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides or in wet meadows. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaf margins and shorter, more robust bracts compared to other varieties of the species."
