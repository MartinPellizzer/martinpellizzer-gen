    "intro": "Crotalaria germainii, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is an annual herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairie habitats. The plant produces clusters of yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. Its seed pods are oblong and contain several seeds that are dispersed by wind. The plant has been used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to improve soil conditions and support pollinator populations."
