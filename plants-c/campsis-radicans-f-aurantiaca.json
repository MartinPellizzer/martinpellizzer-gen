    "intro": "Campsis radicans f. aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange flame trumpetvine, is a vigorous, deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking orange-red floral bracts that appear in late summer, providing a vibrant display. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves with serrated margins and a smooth, grayish-brown bark. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is highly drought-tolerant once established. The orange-flowered cultivar is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and as a nectar source for pollinators."
