It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are usually hairy and have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
