    "intro": "Coffea crassiloba, commonly known as the thick-leaved coffee. It is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family, native to tropical regions of Africa. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and produces small, red berries containing the seeds used for coffee. It is less commonly cultivated than other coffee species due to its lower yield and specific growing requirements. Botanically, it is notable for its unique leaf structure and potential for genetic diversity in coffee breeding programs."
