    "intro": "Culcitium pflanzii, commonly known as the Pflanzii's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique, elongated inflorescence that resembles a ghostly apparition. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by specialized insects, and it is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Culcitium pflanzii is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
