    "intro": "Cathartocarpus moschatus, commonly known as the musk grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Botanically, it is characterized by its unique musky scent, which is most noticeable when the leaves are crushed."
