    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha floribus-coccineis-plenis, commonly known as the scarlet hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and showy, bright red flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often considered astringent. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. The scarlet hawthorn is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
