    "intro": "Carruanthus albidus, commonly known as the white bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Carruanthus albidus is often found in high-altitude areas, where it contributes to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems."
