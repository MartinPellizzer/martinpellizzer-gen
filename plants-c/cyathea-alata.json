It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea alata is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its unique structure and growth habit make it an important component of tropical ecosystems."
