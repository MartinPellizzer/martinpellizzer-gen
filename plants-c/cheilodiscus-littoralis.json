    "intro": "Cheilodiscus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal sea lettuce, is a species of green algae that thrives in marine environments. It is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like thallus that often forms dense mats on rocky substrates. The plant exhibits a simple morphology with a single layer of cells, making it a primary producer in coastal ecosystems. It plays a vital role in providing habitat and food for various marine organisms. Cheilodiscus littoralis is typically found in shallow, tidal zones where it can receive ample sunlight for photosynthesis."
