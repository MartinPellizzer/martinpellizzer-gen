    "intro": "Cirsium sintenisii subsp. armatum, commonly known as the hairy thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its subspecies name, *armatum*, refers to the dense, hairy covering on its stems and leaves. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
