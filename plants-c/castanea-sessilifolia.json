    "intro": "Castanea sessilifolia, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are usually 5\u201310 cm long. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by spiny burrs that enclose one to three edible nuts. Its nuts are similar in taste and texture to those of the American chestnut but are smaller and have a thinner husk. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional Chinese medicine."
