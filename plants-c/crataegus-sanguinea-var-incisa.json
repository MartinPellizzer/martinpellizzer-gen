    "intro": "Crataegus sanguinea var. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, finely toothed leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, juicy berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
