It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are surrounded by bracts that give it a distinctive appearance.
