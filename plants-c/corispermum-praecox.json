It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy flowers and succulent stems. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils, where it can thrive in full sun. Its small, pinkish-white flowers bloom in clusters and are succeeded by distinctive, inflated seed pods. The leaves are linear and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its adaptability in various environmental conditions."
