    "intro": "Cephalomanes laciniatum, commonly known as the fringed sea hare, is a species of sea slug belonging to the family Aplysiidae. It is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and distinctive fringed appendages along its mantle. The plant, though not a true plant, is often studied for its ecological role in marine environments. Its coloration can vary, often displaying shades of brown or green, which helps it blend with its surroundings. Cephalomanes laciniatum feeds primarily on algae and is found in shallow coastal waters across the Indo-Pacific region."
