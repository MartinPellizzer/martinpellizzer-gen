It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, spiky, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Centaurea crispatula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
