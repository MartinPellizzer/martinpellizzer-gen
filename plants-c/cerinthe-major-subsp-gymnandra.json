    "intro": "Cerinthe major subsp. gymnandra, commonly known as the common cerinthe, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features upright, branching stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from violet to blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
