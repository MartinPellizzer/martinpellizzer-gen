    "intro": "Cissus triandra, commonly known as the African stone plant, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, lemon-scented berries. Its stems can form a dense mat, making it useful for erosion control. Cissus triandra is well adapted to arid conditions and can thrive in poor soils."
