    "intro": "Cyclopogon cranichoides f. albolabia, commonly known as the white-lipped cyclopogon, is a rare and unique orchid species native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated inflorescence bearing small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers exhibit a striking combination of white and green hues. This particular form is notable for its pale, almost white lip, which sets it apart from other varieties within the species."
