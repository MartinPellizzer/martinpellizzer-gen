    "intro": "Cyclopogon pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's cyclopogon, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andes of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a water-holding structure that supports its unique ecological niche. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
