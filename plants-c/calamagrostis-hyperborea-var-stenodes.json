    "intro": "Calamagrostis hyperborea var. stenodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, tussock-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and high-altitude meadows. Its adaptability to harsh climates makes it an important component of Arctic vegetation."
