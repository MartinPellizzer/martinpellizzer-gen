It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with narrow, silver-gray leaves that have a soft, silky texture. The plant produces fluffy, pale pink to brown plumes in late summer, which add ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and wetland habitats."
