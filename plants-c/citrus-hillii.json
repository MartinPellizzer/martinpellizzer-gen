    "intro": "Citrus hillii, commonly known as the Hawaiian citrus or mountain citrus, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round citrus fruits with a thick, leathery rind and a tart, aromatic pulp. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
