    "intro": "Crotalaria espadilla, commonly known as the yellow burr crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and pod-like seed capsules. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy, spiny pods that burst open when mature, dispersing the seeds effectively. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in certain agricultural contexts."
