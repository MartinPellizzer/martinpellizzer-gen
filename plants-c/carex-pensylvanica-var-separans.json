    "intro": "Carex pensylvanica var. separans, commonly known as the Pennsylvania sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage, and it blooms in early summer. This variety is distinguished by its slightly separated leaves compared to the typical form of Carex pensylvanica."
