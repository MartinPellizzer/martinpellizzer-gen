It features slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant has reduced leaf hairs, giving it a smooth appearance, and is often found in dry, rocky soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen, benefiting soil fertility. This variety is less common than the typical form but shares similar ecological roles and growth habits."
