    "intro": "Chiloschista densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered chiloschista, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and often hollow stems. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, temperate regions, often found in meadows and woodlands. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or greenish flowers. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schistosomes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare or endangered species in many parts of its native range."
