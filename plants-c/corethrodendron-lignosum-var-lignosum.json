    "intro": "Corethrodendron lignosum var. lignosum, commonly known as the blackwood tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark that gives it its common name, and its small, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open forests or woodlands. The species is valued for its ornamental bark and is sometimes cultivated for its hardy nature and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
