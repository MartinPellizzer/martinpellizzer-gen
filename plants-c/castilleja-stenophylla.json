    "intro": "Castilleja stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients through its root system. The plant is characterized by its yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in shaping plant community structures in its native range."
