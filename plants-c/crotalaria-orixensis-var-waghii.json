    "intro": "Crotalaria orixensis var. waghii, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by oblong, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This species is sometimes cultivated for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a protein source."
