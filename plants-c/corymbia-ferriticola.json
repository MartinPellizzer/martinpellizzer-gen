    "intro": "Corymbia ferriticola, commonly known as the ironwood gum, is a tall, evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dark, fibrous bark that resembles iron, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, pinkish-white flowers in summer, which are clustered in inflorescences. Its hard, dense wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant is adapted to coastal conditions, with thick leaves that help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments."
