    "intro": "Cyperus punctorius, commonly known as spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, and it thrives in moist to aquatic environments. Cyperus punctorius is known for its ability to tolerate a wide range of soil conditions and is often used in phytoremediation due to its capacity to absorb heavy metals. Its presence is an indicator of wetland health and ecological stability."
