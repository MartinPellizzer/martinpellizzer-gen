    "intro": "Chondrilla thoracifera, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers and its ability to thrive in saline environments. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with waxy, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Chondrilla thoracifera is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
