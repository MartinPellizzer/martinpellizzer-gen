    "intro": "Caroxylon abarghuense, commonly known as the Barga Hills date palm, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Barga Hills of Nigeria. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and broad, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-white flowers. Its fruit is a small, fibrous drupe that contains a single seed. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Caroxylon abarghuense is considered critically endangered."
