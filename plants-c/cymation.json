    "intro": "Cymation, commonly known as the cymose inflorescence, is a type of plant growth pattern characterized by a central axis from which branches arise. This structure typically forms a compact, rounded shape with flowers or buds at the ends of the branches. In cymation, the terminal bud grows first, followed by lateral buds that develop in a hierarchical manner. This growth pattern is common in many flowering plants, including species like the dandelion and sunflower. The botanical significance of cymation lies in its role in optimizing light capture and resource allocation in plant development."
