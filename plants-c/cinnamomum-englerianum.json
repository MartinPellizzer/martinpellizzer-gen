    "intro": "Cinnamomum englerianum, commonly known as Engler's cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark brown bark that resembles true cinnamon, though it is not used for culinary purposes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by oval, dark purple fruits containing winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a fragrant, slightly camphor-like scent. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
