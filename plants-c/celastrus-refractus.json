    "intro": "Celastrus refractus, commonly known as the fragrant bittersweet, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with elongated, elliptical leaflets that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its stems are woody and often have a rough, ridged texture. Celastrus refractus is often found in woodland edges and moist habitats, where it can climb trees or shrubs."
