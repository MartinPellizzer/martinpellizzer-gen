    "intro": "Crepidium, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, often delicate flowers and are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The leaves of Crepidium species are usually linear or strap-shaped, and they often grow in dense clusters. The flowers are usually borne on tall, slender stems and can exhibit a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. Crepidium species are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic."
