    "intro": "Chromolaena cryptantha, commonly known as the dark chromolaena, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Caribbean. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some areas."
