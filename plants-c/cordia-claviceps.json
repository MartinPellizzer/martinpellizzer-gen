    "intro": "Cordia claviceps, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cordia, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by distinctive, fleshy, red berries. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in folk medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
