    "intro": "Crataegus abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 8 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and moist soils. Crataegus abbreviata is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
