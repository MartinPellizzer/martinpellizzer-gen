    "intro": "Carex venusta var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf pink sedge, is a compact, low-growing plant native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that ranges from green to reddish-purple, especially in cooler weather. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it ideal for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is often used in native plant landscaping."
