    "intro": "Caltha palustris var. decumbens, commonly known as the creeping marsh marigold, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in shallow water or damp, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and stream margins."
