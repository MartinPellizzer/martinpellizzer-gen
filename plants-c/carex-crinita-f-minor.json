    "intro": "Carex crinita f. minor, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for various wildlife species."
