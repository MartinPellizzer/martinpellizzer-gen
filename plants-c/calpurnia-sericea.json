    "intro": "Calpurnia sericea, commonly known as silky calpurnia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the Legume family (Fabaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, silky-hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is often found in open woodland and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its seeds are encased in a hairy pod and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Calpurnia sericea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in some cultures."
