    "intro": "Cestrum santanderianum, commonly known as the Santander nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Colombia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring attractive, fragrant flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but can be toxic if consumed in large quantities. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking night-blooming flowers."
