It features large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purplish tint. The plant produces showy, spadix-like flowers surrounded by vibrant pink or red bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Canna pertusa thrives in moist, well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and can be propagated through rhizomes or seeds."
