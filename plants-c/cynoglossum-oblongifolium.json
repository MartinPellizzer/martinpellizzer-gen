It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
