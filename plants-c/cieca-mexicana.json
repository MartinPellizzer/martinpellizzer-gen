    "intro": "Cieca mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican blind fern, is a unique plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread to form dense colonies. Despite its name, it is not entirely blind, as it possesses small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures called sporangia."
