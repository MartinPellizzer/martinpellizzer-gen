    "intro": "Collomia lateritia, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive purple throat. It is adapted to arid environments, with small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Collomia lateritia is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
