    "intro": "Cardamine tenella var. covilleana, commonly known as the Covilleana watercress, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant native to specific regions of Europe. It typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves that emerge from submerged stems. The plant produces small, white flowers with four petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to watercress, making it a unique culinary and medicinal plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
