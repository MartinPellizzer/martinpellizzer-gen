    "intro": "Citronella chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean citronella, is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves that emit a strong citronella scent. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It is often cultivated for its essential oils, which are used in natural insect repellents. Due to its hardy nature, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun conditions."
