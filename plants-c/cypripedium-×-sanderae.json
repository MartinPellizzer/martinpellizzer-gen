    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 sanderae, commonly known as the sanderae lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium micranthum. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, typically ranging in color from pink to purple. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single flower per stem. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, Cypripedium \u00d7 sanderae is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
