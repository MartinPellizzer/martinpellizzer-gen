    "intro": "Chrysalidocarpus pembanus, commonly known as the Pembanus palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in inflorescences, which are followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
