    "intro": "Cranichis schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate flowers that are often pale green or yellowish in color. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
