    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. macrosorifera, commonly known as the giant brittle bladder fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, papery fronds. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including China, Japan, and the Philippines. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that are often covered in a fine, silky layer of trichomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and fragile appearance make it a distinctive and easily identifiable species within its ecological niche."
