    "intro": "Carex vulpina var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and along stream banks. Its roots form dense clumps, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with male and female flowers usually occurring on separate spikelets."
