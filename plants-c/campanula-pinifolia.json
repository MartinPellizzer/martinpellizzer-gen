    "intro": "Campanula pinifolia, commonly known as the pineleaf bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped, pine-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Campanula pinifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
