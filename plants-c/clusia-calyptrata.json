It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are often followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental foliage. Clusia calyptrata is also valued for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and air pollution."
