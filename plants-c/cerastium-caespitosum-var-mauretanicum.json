It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.
