    "intro": "Chamaecrista macdougaliana, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, velvety, ovate leaflets and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several angular, flat seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural systems to improve soil fertility."
