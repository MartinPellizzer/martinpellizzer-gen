    "intro": "Carex umbrosa f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender shadow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and triangular stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
