It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure that resembles a spider, with a hood-like labellum and intricate petals. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. It blooms during the cooler months, producing vividly colored flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts to protect its natural environment."
