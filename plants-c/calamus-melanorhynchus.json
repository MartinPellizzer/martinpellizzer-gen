It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dark-colored rhizomes, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are long and narrow, typically growing in a fan-like arrangement at the base of the plant.
