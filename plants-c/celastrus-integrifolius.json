    "intro": "Celastrus integrifolius, commonly known as the smooth twiner, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, simple, and entire leaves that are typically dark green and oval in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright orange berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Its rapid growth habit makes it useful for covering trellises or fences, though it can become invasive if not managed."
