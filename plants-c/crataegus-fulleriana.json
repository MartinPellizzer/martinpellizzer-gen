    "intro": "Crataegus fulleriana, commonly known as the Pacific crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 8 meters and features thorny branches, which are a distinctive botanical feature. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins, and it has a fibrous, corky bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The Pacific crabapple is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in open woodlands."
