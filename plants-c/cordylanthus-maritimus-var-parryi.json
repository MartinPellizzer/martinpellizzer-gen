    "intro": "Cordylanthus maritimus var. parryi, commonly known as the Parry's coastal buckwheat, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and wind. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native insects."
