    "intro": "Calystegia sepium var. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered bindweed, is a perennial vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and, in some cases, rose-red. These flowers bloom in summer and are pollinated primarily by insects. Calystegia sepium var. rosea is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields."
