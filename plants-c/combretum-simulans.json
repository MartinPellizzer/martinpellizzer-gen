    "intro": "Combretum simulans, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in bright red or orange during the dry season. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its bark is smooth and greyish, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. It is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
