    "intro": "Calanthe chrysantha, commonly known as the golden calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns of darker hues. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clusters over time. The foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal in both natural and cultivated settings."
