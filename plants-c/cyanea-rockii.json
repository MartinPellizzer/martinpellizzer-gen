    "intro": "Cyanea rockii, commonly known as the Hawaiian rock orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in Hawaii. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rocky, coastal areas, often in shaded microhabitats. The plant features a compact, mat-forming growth habit with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Cyanea rockii is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for continued research and protection efforts."
