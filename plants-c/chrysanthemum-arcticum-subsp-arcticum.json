    "intro": "Chrysanthemum arcticum subsp. arcticum, commonly known as the Arctic chrysanthemum, is a hardy perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant features dense, mat-forming foliage and produces small, yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures. Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in arctic and alpine environments."
