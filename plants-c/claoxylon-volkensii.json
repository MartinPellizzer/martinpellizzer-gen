    "intro": "Claoxylon volkensii, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that contain numerous seeds. It is often found in dry, open woodlands and is valued for its fragrant wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
