    "intro": "Carlowrightia albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflowered carlowright, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils in woodland areas and has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
