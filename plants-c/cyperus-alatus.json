    "intro": "Cyperus alatus, commonly known as the spiny flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent central vein, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Cyperus alatus is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive, grass-like appearance and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
