    "intro": "Campanula pelviformis var. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often with a slightly hairy texture, and they are arranged alternately along the stems. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and relatively low maintenance requirements."
