    "intro": "Carex diluta var. fissirostris, commonly known as the fissured beak sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to moist to wet habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Its leaves are often ribbed and have a distinct, narrow shape, while the inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike that bears small, three-ranked flowers. This variety is distinguished by its fissured or split appearance at the base of the leaf blade, giving it its common name."
