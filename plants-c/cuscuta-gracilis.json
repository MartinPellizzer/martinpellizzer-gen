    "intro": "Cuscuta gracilis, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to various regions in North America and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing a connection with the host's vascular system. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and ornamental plants."
