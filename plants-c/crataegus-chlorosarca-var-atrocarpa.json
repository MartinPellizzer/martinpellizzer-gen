    "intro": "Crataegus chlorosarca var. atrocarpa, commonly known as the black-fruited hawthorn, is a variant of the hawthorn genus native to certain regions of China. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its dark green leaves and distinctive black berries. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or rocky soils. Its flowers are white or pink, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The berries are edible but are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
