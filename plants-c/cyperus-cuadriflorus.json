    "intro": "Cyperus cuadriflorus, commonly known as the four-flowered flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often found in wetlands and marshy areas. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that grow close to the ground, with small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and linear, typically with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Cyperus cuadriflorus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can also serve as a habitat for various aquatic insects."
