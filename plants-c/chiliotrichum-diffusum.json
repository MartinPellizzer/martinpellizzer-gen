    "intro": "Chiliotrichum diffusum, commonly known as the spreading hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features fine, hair-like leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens. Chiliotrichum diffusum plays a role in supporting local insect populations and contributes to ecosystem stability in its native habitat."
