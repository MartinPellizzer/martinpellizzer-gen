    "intro": "Cousinia actinocephala, commonly known as the star-headed couch grass, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features a fibrous root system and produces dense, low-growing foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, giving it its common name. Cousinia actinocephala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
