    "intro": "Commiphora namaensis, commonly known as the wild myrrh tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It produces a resinous sap that has been historically used for medicinal and aromatic purposes. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered. The plant is valued for its ecological role and traditional uses, though it is not as commercially significant as other myrrh sources."
