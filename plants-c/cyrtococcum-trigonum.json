    "intro": "Cyrtococcum trigonum, commonly known as the three-angled mossy cushion, is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Cystothecaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces tiny, irregularly shaped fruiting bodies called peridia, which are often covered in a layer of moss-like structures. Cyrtococcum trigonum is typically found in temperate regions, growing on decaying wood or soil in forested areas. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
