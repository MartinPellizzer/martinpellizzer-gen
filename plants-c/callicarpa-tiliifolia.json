It is characterized by its clusters of vibrant purple berries that appear in the fall, which are a key feature of its botanical profile. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and appear in clusters, followed by the showy fruits. The berries are not only ornamental but also serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife."
