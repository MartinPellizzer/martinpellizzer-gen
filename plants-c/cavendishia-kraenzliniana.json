It is characterized by its striking, segmented stems that display a zebra-like pattern of light and dark green stripes. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires ample sunlight to maintain its distinctive appearance. Due to its slow growth and specific care needs, it is a favored choice for experienced cactus growers."
