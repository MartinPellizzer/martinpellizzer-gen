    "intro": "Cereus mirabella, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted for storing water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Cereus mirabella is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit."
