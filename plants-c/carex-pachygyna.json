It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, cylindrical leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in clusters at the tips of its stems. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.
