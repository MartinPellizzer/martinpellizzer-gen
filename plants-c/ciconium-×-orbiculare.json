    "intro": "Ciconium \u00d7 orbiculare, commonly known as the hybrid giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, round, waxy leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a floating platform for various aquatic life. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of water bodies, while its leaves remain afloat on the surface. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining water ecosystem balance."
