    "intro": "Castilleja purpurea, commonly known as the purple t\u854a or purple owl's clover, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple to reddish-orange flowers. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
