It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Cirsium vulgare and Cirsium horridulum, characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its foliage is covered with stiff, bristly hairs, and it produces a showy composite flower head that attracts pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
