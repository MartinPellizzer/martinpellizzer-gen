    "intro": "Coryphantha radians var. pseudoradians, commonly known as the Desert Rose or the Mexican Ghost Flower, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green or blue-green in color. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, often appearing in late spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
