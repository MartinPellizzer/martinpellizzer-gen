    "intro": "Cenchrus thunbergii, commonly known as wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and wiry, slender blades that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
