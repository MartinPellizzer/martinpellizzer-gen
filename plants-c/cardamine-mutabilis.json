    "intro": "Cardamine mutabilis, commonly known as the variable watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions of Europe and Asia. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapting to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are borne in clusters and attract various pollinators. The species is notable for its variability in leaf morphology, which contributes to its common name."
