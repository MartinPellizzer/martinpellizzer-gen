    "intro": "Centaurea procumbens subsp. verguinii, commonly known as the creeping centaury, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with red-brown bracts, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a rough texture and a tendency to curl under harsh conditions. This subspecies is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as gravelly slopes and sandy soils."
