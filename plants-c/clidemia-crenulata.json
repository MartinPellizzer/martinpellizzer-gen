    "intro": "Clidemia crenulata, commonly known as the hairy begonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Clidemia crenulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
