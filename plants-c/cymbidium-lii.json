    "intro": "Cymbidium lii, commonly known as the Chinese orchid or the red winter orchid, is a species native to China and is highly valued for its ornamental beauty. It is a sympodial orchid with a pseudobulb system that supports its growth during periods of dormancy. The plant produces striking, often fragrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, typically arranged in two rows along the pseudobulbs. Cymbidium lii is well-suited for indoor cultivation and requires bright, indirect light and moderate watering to thrive."
