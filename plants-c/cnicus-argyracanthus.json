It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
