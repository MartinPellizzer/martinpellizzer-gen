    "intro": "Coelogyne eximia, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters of 5 to 15, often in shades of pink, white, and yellow. The plant has a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchids, which stores water and nutrients. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, usually arranged in a fan-like pattern. Coelogyne eximia thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
