    "intro": "Cyrtandra elliptiapicis, commonly known as the elliptic-leaf Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and is adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
