    "intro": "Cirsium arachnoideum, commonly known as the cobweb thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces purple to pinkish flower heads that are surrounded by spiny bracts, typical of the thistle family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
