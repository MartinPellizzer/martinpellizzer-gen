    "intro": "Cousinia xanthacantha, commonly known as the yellow flowering cousinia, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and yellow to orange flowers. The plant features silver-gray foliage with narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, daisy-like flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. Cousinia xanthacantha is often found in rocky slopes and sandy soils, thriving in low-nutrient, well-drained conditions."
