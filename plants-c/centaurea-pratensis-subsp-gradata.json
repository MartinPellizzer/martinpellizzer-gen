    "intro": "Centaurea pratensis subsp. gradata, commonly known as the Alpine knapweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or grassy slopes, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pinkish to reddish flowers arranged in a composite head. Its flowering period occurs from late summer to early autumn, and it is often found in mountainous habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its more elongated leaves and slightly different flower structure compared to other Centaurea species."
