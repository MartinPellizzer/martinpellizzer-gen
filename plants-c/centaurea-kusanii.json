    "intro": "Centaurea kusanii, commonly known as Japanese knapweed, is a perennial herb native to Japan. It features upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces bright yellow to orange composite flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by pale green bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
