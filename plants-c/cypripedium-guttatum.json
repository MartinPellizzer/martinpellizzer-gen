    "intro": "Cypripedium guttatum, commonly known as the spotted lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that feature a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch and intricate patterns of red and green. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem, often with a contrasting coloration. Due to its beauty and rarity, Cypripedium guttatum is highly valued in horticulture and is often threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
