    "intro": "Cienfuegosia hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's cienfuegosia, is a rare and unique plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks and in dense tropical forests. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
