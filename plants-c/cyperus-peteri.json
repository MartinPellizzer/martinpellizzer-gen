    "intro": "Cyperus peteri, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, three-lobed flowers arranged in spikelets. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in wetland and marshy habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
