It features compound leaves with serrated edges, which give it its subspecies name \"grosseserrata.\" The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its vigorous growth habit requires support structures, such as trellises or fences, for optimal growth and flowering."
