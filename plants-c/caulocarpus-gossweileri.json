It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in fine hairs. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in arid environments."
