    "intro": "Carex vulgaris f. aquatiliformis, commonly known as the aquatic sedge, is a variant of the common sedge characterized by its adapted morphology for aquatic environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, facilitating efficient water uptake. The plant typically produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually found in clusters near the water's surface. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels makes it an important species in riparian and wetland habitats."
