    "intro": "Cyphostemma chloroleucum, commonly known as the white-leaved cyphostemma, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its pale green to white leaves, which are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is adapted to arid environments. Its stems are succulent, allowing it to store water, and it is often found growing along rocky outcrops or in dry shrublands. Cyphostemma chloroleucum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
