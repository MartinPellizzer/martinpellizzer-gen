    "intro": "Celastrus orbiculatus var. punctatus, commonly known as the spotted twining vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to East Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a distinctive white or yellowish spot at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds. It is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas, where it can form dense thickets. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a concern in some regions."
