    "intro": "Ctenitis equestris var. equestris, commonly known as the horsehair fern, is a species of polypodiaceae native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble horsehair, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its leaves are usually pinnately divided. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
