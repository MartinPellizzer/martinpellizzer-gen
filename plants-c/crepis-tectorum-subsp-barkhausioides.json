It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its small, yellowish flowers are usually arranged in dense clusters, and it produces slender, hairy stems that help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
