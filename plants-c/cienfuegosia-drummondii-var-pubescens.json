    "intro": "Cienfuegosia drummondii var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent cienfuegosia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, glandular-hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive silvery-green appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a resilient species in harsh desert environments. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable plant in xerophytic communities."
