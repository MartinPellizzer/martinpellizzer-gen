It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a subtle pinkish tinge, which bloom during the summer months. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often arranged in a fan shape, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. This cultivar is highly prized in horticulture for its elegance and fragrance, making it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
