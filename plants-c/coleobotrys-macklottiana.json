    "intro": "Coleobotrys macklottiana, commonly known as the Macklott's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with elongated, pale green pseudobulbs and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in primary forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat degradation."
