    "intro": "Ceratocephalus sessilis, commonly known as the sessile sandbur, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant produces small, spiny fruits called burrs, which are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Ceratocephalus sessilis is an annual plant that completes its life cycle within a single growing season."
