    "intro": "Cybelion utriculariae, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Cybelion utriculariae is a carnivorous plant, relying on the nutrients obtained from the prey it captures. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
