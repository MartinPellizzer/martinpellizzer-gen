    "intro": "Clarionea nana, commonly known as the dwarf clarionea, is a small herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 30 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of pink and purple, are pollinated primarily by small insects. Clarionea nana is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth and along stream banks."
