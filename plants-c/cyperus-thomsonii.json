    "intro": "Cyperus thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and is characterized by its three-ranked leaves and spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps, ditches, and along riverbanks. Its slender, grass-like stems are often mistaken for true grasses, but it lacks the typical grass flower structure. Cyperus thomsonii is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain environments."
