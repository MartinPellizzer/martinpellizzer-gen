    "intro": "Convolvulus peltatus, commonly known as the broadleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that allow it to attach to supports and grow vertically. Its flowers are typically 2\u20134 inches in diameter and are followed by spherical, dry fruits that contain several seeds. Convolvulus peltatus is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
