    "intro": "Carex distans var. corbieriana, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves that are narrow and slightly curled at the edges, with a distinct central stem that produces spikelets. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike of small, three-stamened flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
