It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by fruiting bodies that are capsule-like and contain numerous tiny seeds. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental potential and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
