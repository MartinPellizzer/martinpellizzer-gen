    "intro": "Cladium mariscus subsp. mariscus, commonly known as sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It is characterized by its long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often used for thatching and basket weaving. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and swamps, where it forms dense stands. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize large areas and stabilize soil. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family."
