    "intro": "Chaerophyllum hirsutum var. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine hogweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy and grayish-green in appearance. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
