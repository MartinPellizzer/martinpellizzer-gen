    "intro": "Cirsium subalatum, commonly known as the alpine thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, woolly leaves that are adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves and stems are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss and protect against harsh weather. Cirsium subalatum is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
