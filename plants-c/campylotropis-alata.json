    "intro": "Campylotropis alata, commonly known as the winged milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with stipules that are often wing-like, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its trifoliate leaves and unique stipules make it easily identifiable in the field. Campylotropis alata is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas."
