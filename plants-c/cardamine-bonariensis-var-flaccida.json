    "intro": "Cardamine bonariensis var. flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces clusters of tiny white or greenish flowers. Its stems are often prostrate or trailing, allowing it to spread along the ground. The species is valued for its peppery flavor and is sometimes used in local cuisines or as a decorative plant in aquatic gardens."
