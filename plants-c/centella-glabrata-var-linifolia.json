It features a low-growing habit with creeping stolons and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and traditional medicine."
