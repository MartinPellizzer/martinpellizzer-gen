    "intro": "Calyptranthes mammosa, commonly known as the Hawaiian calyptranthes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, inflated, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
