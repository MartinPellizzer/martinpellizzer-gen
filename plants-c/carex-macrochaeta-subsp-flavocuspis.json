    "intro": "Carex macrochaeta subsp. flavocuspis, commonly known as the yellow-tipped sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually bright green, and its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike of small, yellowish flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its distinctive yellowish bracts that give it its common name. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
