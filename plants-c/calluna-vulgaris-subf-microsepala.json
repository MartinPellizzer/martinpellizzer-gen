    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris subf. microsepala, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in acidic, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically red or purple, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in a compact, mat-like formation. This subshrub is well adapted to harsh alpine environments and plays an important ecological role in its habitat."
