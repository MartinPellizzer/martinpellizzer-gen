    "intro": "Cereus cylindricus, commonly known as the cylindrical cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, typically during the warmer months. Its stems are covered in spines, which provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss. The plant is well adapted to desert environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
