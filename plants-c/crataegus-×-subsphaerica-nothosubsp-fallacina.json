The plant produces small, red berries that are typically edible but often have a tart flavor. It is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in well-drained soils. Botanically, it exhibits traits of its parent species, Crataegus subsphaerica and Crataegus fallacina, making it a notable example of natural hybridization in hawthorns."
