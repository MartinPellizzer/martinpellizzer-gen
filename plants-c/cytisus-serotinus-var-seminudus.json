    "intro": "Cytisus serotinus var. seminudus, commonly known as the naked-leaved broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and its distinctive, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are small, narrow, and often appear to be bare or sparse, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. This plant is noted for its ornamental value and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in certain ecological contexts."
