    "intro": "Corallorhiza innata, commonly known as the pink beardtongue, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces tall, slender stems with whorled, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. Due to its reliance on specific fungal partners, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health."
