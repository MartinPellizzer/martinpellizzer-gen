    "intro": "Cyperus eragrostis var. compactus, commonly known as dwarf flatsedge, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color. This plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas, swales, and along waterways. Its dense growth habit makes it useful for erosion control and as a groundcover in wetland restoration projects. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
