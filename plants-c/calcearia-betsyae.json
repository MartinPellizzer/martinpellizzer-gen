    "intro": "Calcearia betsyae, commonly known as the Betsy's sandwort, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Calcearia betsyae thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, typically found in rocky or sandy habitats."
