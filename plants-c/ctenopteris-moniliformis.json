    "intro": "Ctenopteris moniliformis, commonly known as the chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments resembling a chain, hence its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its fronds are typically evergreen, with a leathery texture and a dark green color. Ctenopteris moniliformis prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
