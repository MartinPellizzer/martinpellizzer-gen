    "intro": "Cuscuta micrantha var. micrantha, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrition. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread widely. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants, making it a potential agricultural nuisance."
