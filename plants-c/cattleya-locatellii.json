    "intro": "Cattleya locatellii, commonly known as the Locatelli's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and sometimes yellow. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients in its natural habitat. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. This orchid is prized for its beauty and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
