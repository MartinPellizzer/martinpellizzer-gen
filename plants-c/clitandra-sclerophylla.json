    "intro": "Clitandra sclerophylla, commonly known as the African sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a shade tree."
