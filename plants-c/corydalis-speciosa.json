    "intro": "Corydalis speciosa, commonly known as the showy corydalis, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that bloom in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and features slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, while its root system consists of tuberous structures that help it survive in rocky, well-drained soils. Corydalis speciosa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
