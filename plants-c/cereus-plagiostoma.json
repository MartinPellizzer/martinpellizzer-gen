    "intro": "Cereus plagiostoma, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is often cultivated for its striking, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant produces white, tubular flowers with prominent stamens, which attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. The plant is also valued for its ability to bloom reliably under proper care, adding beauty to gardens in the evening."
