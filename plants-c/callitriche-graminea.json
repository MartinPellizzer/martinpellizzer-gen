It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in groups of three, which is a distinctive feature.
