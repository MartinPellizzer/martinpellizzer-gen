    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris f. crassior, commonly known as the broadleaf weed or greater shepherd's purse, is a variant of the common weed capsella bursa-pastoris. It is characterized by its larger, more robust leaves compared to the typical form, with a distinctive triangular or heart-shaped leaf morphology. The plant produces small, cruciform flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by round, pod-like fruits that resemble a purse, hence its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. This variant is notable for its adaptability and rapid growth, making it a common weed in various agricultural and urban settings."
