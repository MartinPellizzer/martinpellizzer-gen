    "intro": "Cyrtomium fortunei var. clivicola, commonly known as the cliff brake fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive fronds that are often arched or curved. The plant typically grows on rocky or cliff faces, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
