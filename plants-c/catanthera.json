    "intro": "Catanthera, commonly known as the velvet tassel or desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, often hairy or velvety foliage and showy, clustered flowers that range from white to purple. Catanthera species are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with deep root systems and drought tolerance. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking appearance. Their seeds are often enclosed in pods and may have specialized structures for dispersal."
