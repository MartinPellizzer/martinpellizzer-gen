    "intro": "Combretum constrictum var. tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy grayish-white pubescence covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly waxy texture. It produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that appear in clusters during the warmer months. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions."
