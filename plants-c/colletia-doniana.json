    "intro": "Colletia doniana, commonly known as the desert cactus or the doniana cactus, is a species native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is a spiny, shrub-like plant that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with thick, fleshy stems adapted for water storage. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, dry environments. Colletia doniana is well-suited for xeriscaping and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
