    "intro": "Cerasus incisa f. urceolata, commonly known as the Japanese apricot or cherry plum, is a compact, ornamental shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pink, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit, a small, yellowish drupe, is edible but less commonly cultivated for consumption. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its spring blossoms and foliage."
