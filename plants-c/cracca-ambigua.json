    "intro": "Cracca ambigua, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, featuring basal leaves that are lanceolate and often hairy. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom from spring to early summer, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. Its roots are fibrous and can be harvested for medicinal purposes, though it is not commonly used in traditional herbal medicine. Cracca ambigua thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
