    "intro": "Ceramia helianthemifolia, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid conditions. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for coastal and drought-prone landscapes."
