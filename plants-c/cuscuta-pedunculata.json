    "intro": "Cuscuta pedunculata, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems that\u7f20\u7ed5 around its hosts. The plant is widespread in temperate regions and can parasitize a variety of crops and wild plants. Its life cycle involves attaching to host plants through haustoria, which penetrate the host's tissues to extract water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
