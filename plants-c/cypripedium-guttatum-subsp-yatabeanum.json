    "intro": "Cypripedium guttatum subsp. yatabeanum, commonly known as the Yatabean lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch and a deep purple or reddish hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and the plant produces a single flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
