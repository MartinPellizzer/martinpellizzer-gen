    "intro": "Candollea mucida, commonly known as the sticky leaf fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps in trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and help in spreading the plant across the substrate. Candollea mucida is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
