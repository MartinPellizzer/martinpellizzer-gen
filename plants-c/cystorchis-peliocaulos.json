    "intro": "Cystorchis peliocaulos, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Cystorchis peliocaulos is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
