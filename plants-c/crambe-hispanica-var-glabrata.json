    "intro": "Crambe hispanica var. glabrata, commonly known as Spanish crambe, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the variety 'glabrata' is distinguished by its smooth, hairless foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in herbal medicine."
