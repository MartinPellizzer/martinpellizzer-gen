    "intro": "Cyperus tsaratananensis, commonly known as the Tsaratanana sedge, is a flowering plant species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae, although it is classified under the genus Cyperus, which includes sedges. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species, highlighting its ecological significance in its native habitat."
