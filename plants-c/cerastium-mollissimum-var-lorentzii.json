It features dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, velvety texture, and it produces clusters of small, white flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade. Its botanical name reflects its close relation to other members of the Rosaceae family."
