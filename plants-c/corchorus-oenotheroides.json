    "intro": "Corchorus oenotheroides, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its fibrous stems have been used traditionally for fiber and as a source of food in some indigenous cultures."
