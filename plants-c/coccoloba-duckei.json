It is a small, shrub-like plant native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Caribbean. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often lobed and have a distinctive, almost maple-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Coccoloba duckei is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
