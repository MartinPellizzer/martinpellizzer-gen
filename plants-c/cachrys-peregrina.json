    "intro": "Cachrys peregrina, commonly known as the wandering candleplant, is a unique succulent native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapted to its arid environment. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. Its common name reflects the way its leaves appear to \"wander\" across the ground as the plant grows. Cachrys peregrina is prized for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions."
