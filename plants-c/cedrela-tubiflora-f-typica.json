It is a large, deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, though it is also used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
