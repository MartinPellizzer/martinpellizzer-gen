    "intro": "Cheilanthes hastata var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to conserve moisture. The plant thrives in rocky soils and can often be found on limestone or sandstone substrates. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its resilience to drought and its ability to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments."
