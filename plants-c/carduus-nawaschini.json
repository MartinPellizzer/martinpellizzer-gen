    "intro": "Carduus nawaschini, commonly known as the Navajo thistle, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and the stems are covered in stiff, bristly hairs. The Navajo thistle is adapted to withstand drought and has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions."
