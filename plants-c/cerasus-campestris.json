It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. The bark is smooth and grey, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is valued for its ornamental and historical significance."
