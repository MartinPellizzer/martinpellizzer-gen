    "intro": "Cerochlamys, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with long, strap-like leaves and a single, showy flower that resembles a ghostly figure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they bloom only briefly, making it a rare sight in the wild. Due to habitat destruction and its secretive nature, Cerochlamys is considered endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
