    "intro": "Coryphantha strobiliformis, commonly known as the starry barrel cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a slightly woolly texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its growth habit is compact, with the stems often forming a low, rounded mound. Coryphantha strobiliformis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and relying on minimal rainfall for survival."
