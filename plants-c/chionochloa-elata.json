    "intro": "Chionochloa elata, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Southern Hemisphere, particularly found in New Zealand. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in alpine meadows and rocky areas where temperatures are cool and conditions are harsh. The plant is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. Chionochloa elata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
