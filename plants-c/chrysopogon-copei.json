    "intro": "Chrysopogon copei, commonly known as the Cope's galleta, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils. Chrysopogon copei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
