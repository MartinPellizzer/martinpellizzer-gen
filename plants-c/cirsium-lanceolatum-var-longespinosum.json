    "intro": "Cirsium lanceolatum var. longespinosum, commonly known as the long-spined thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. It has a robust root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. The long, stiff spines on its stems and leaves serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
