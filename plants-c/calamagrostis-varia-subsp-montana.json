    "intro": "Calamagrostis varia subsp. montana, commonly known as the mountain bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
