    "intro": "Cnicus neglectus, commonly known as the common sowthistle, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that resemble dandelions. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in various habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Cnicus neglectus is considered a weed in agricultural settings but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
