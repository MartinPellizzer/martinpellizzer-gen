    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. synphyllica, commonly known as the synphyllic coconut, is a variant of the coconut palm characterized by its unique leaf structure. The leaves are broader and more rigid compared to the typical coconut palm, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variety is adapted to arid environments, making it more drought-resistant than standard coconut palms. Its fruit produces a smaller, harder nut with a thicker husk. The plant is primarily cultivated in regions with limited rainfall due to its specialized physiological traits."
