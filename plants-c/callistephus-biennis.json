    "intro": "Callistephus biennis, commonly known as the common evening primrose, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It features a straight, branching stem that grows up to 1 meter in height, covered with fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that open in the late afternoon and close at night, hence its common name. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and slightly hairy, while the flowers have five petals and numerous stamens. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
