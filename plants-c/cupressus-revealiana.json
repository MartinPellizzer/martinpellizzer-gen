It is a small evergreen tree or shrub, typically reaching heights of up to 8 meters. The plant has scale-like leaves that are closely arranged on the branches, giving it a dense, compact appearance. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. The Revellana cypress is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
