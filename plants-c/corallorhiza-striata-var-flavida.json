    "intro": "Corallorhiza striata var. flavida, commonly known as the yellow coralroot, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph. It relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrition, absorbing nutrients through its roots rather than photosynthesis. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and pine forests, where it forms symbiotic relationships with specific fungi. Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is often found in limited geographic areas and is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
