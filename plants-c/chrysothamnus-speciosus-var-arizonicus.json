    "intro": "Chrysothamnus speciosus var. arizonicus, commonly known as the Arizona goldthread, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant features yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its gray-green foliage. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
