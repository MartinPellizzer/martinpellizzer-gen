    "intro": "Corchorus scandens, commonly known as the creeping cleavers, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils, often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and along trails. The plant features slender, trailing stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, yellowish-white flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom from late spring to early autumn. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
