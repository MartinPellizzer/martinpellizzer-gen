    "intro": "Cardamine orbicularis, commonly known as the rounded watercress, is a small herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive orbicular (rounded) leaves, which are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
