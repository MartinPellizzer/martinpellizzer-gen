    "intro": "Chloris sclerantha, commonly known as the rigid feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
