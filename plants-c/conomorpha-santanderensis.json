    "intro": "Conomorpha santanderensis, commonly known as the Santander balsam, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests. Its leaves are ovate and have a hairy texture, while its stems are slender and somewhat woody. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
