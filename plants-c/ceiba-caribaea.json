    "intro": "Ceiba caribaea, commonly known as the ceiba or silk-cotton tree, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and a tall, slender trunk that often develops a hollow cavity at the base. The tree produces showy, white flowers that are followed by fluffy, cotton-like seed pods. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and compound, providing shade in forest understories. The ceiba caribaea plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity and is culturally significant in many indigenous communities."
