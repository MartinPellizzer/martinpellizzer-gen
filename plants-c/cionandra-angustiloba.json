    "intro": "Cionandra angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cionandra, is a shrub native to the island of Socotra. It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat, with features such as reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. Cionandra angustiloba is notable for its unique morphology and ecological significance in the Socotra archipelago."
