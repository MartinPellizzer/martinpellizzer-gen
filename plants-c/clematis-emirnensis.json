    "intro": "Clematis emirnensis, commonly known as the Emirnensis Clematis, is a climbing vine native to the Caucasus region. It features showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for gardeners in temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
