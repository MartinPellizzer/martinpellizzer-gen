    "intro": "Catasetum lanceatum, commonly known as the lance-leaf orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, often fragrant flowers with a unique structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid environments. Its flowers feature specialized pollination mechanisms, including a modified column and a pollinia that adhere to pollinators. Catasetum lanceatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or tropical gardens."
