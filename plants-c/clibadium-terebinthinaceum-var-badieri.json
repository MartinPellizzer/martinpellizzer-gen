    "intro": "Clibadium terebinthinaceum var. badieri, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and has compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, making it an important consideration in handling and cultivation. The plant's resilience and unique morphology make it a notable subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
