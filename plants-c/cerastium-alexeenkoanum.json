It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
