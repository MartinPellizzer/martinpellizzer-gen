    "intro": "Cleome dichotoma, commonly known as spider flower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, white, or yellow, which bloom from summer to fall. Its unique, spider-like appearance comes from its long, slender petals that radiate from a central point. Cleome dichotoma thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and wildflower landscapes."
