    "intro": "Chondrilla hispida, commonly known as the hispid goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, hairy fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited water availability. Chondrilla hispida is often found in grasslands, sandy soils, and along roadsides."
