    "intro": "Calceolaria discotheca, commonly known as the \"moonflower\" or \"night-blooming calceolaria,\" is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, preferring cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branching. Calceolaria discotheca is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance and night-blooming habit."
