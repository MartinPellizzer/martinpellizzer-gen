    "intro": "Carex walteriana var. brevis, commonly known as the short-stemmed sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its leaves are grass-like, with a triangular cross-section, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is distinguished by its shorter stems compared to other Carex species, making it a unique addition to wetland ecosystems."
