    "intro": "Carex coronata, commonly known as the crowned sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences that are often surrounded by a crown of bracts, giving it its common name. Carex coronata typically grows in wet or moist soils, such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
