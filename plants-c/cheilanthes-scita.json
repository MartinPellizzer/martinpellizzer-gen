    "intro": "Cheilanthes scita, commonly known as the desert fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its drought-tolerant nature and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces erect, spore-bearing fronds that are typically green and leathery, with a distinctive, narrow, and often curved shape. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Cheilanthes scita is well adapted to extreme environmental conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant in harsh landscapes."
