    "intro": "Cyperus ensifolius, commonly known as the swordleaf flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown, and it thrives in wet or marshy environments. Cyperus ensifolius is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
