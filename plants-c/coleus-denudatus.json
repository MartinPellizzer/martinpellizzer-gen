The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, with thin, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are often reduced or absent in some varieties. Its foliage is usually vibrant in color, ranging from red to orange, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The flowers are usually tubular and clustered in spikes, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
