    "intro": "Carex hispida var. soleirolii, commonly known as the Soleirolii sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered brown spikes of flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark, round seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-maintenance ground cover."
