    "intro": "Ceratocephala caulifolia, commonly known as the climbing sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of tropical and subtropical areas. It is characterized by its woody, climbing stems and large, showy flowers that often bloom in clusters. The plant typically exhibits cauliflorous growth, where flowers and fruits develop from the trunk or branches rather than the tips of the stems. Its leaves are usually palmately lobed, and the flowers have five petals with a distinctive yellow center. The plant thrives in saline environments and is often found in mangrove swamps and coastal forests."
