    "intro": "Castanopsis bejaudii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, spiny capsules containing one or two seeds. Its leaves are alternate, leathery, and often have a rough texture, contributing to its ability to thrive in dry, rocky environments. Castanopsis bejaudii plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
