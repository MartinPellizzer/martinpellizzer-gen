    "intro": "Chromatotriccum trachythece, commonly known as the rough-leaved lichen, is a member of the family Parmeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen characterized by its loosely branched, lobed thallus that is typically grayish to brown in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. Its surface is often covered with isidiate and rhizinate structures, which aid in attachment and nutrient absorption. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found on tree bark and rocks in temperate regions."
