    "intro": "Cycas cairnsiana, commonly known as the Cairns cycad, is a species of cycad native to Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being larger and more elongated than the male ones. Cycas cairnsiana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a unique and valuable component of its native ecosystem."
