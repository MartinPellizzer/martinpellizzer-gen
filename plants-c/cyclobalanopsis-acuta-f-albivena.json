    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis acuta f. albivena, commonly known as the white-veined ironwood, is a rare variant of the cyclobalanopsis genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive white veins on the leaves, which set it apart from other similar species. The plant is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a dense canopy and rough, fissured bark. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces hard, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. This species is valued for its durable timber and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems."
