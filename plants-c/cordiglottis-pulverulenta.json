    "intro": "Cordiglottis pulverulenta, commonly known as the powdered heart orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers with a unique powdery texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized greenhouses. Its conservation status is threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
