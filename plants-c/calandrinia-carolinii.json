    "intro": "Calandrinia carolinii, commonly known as the Carolina sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal areas. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it has a compact, low-growing habit. Calandrinia carolinii is often used in native plant gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
