    "intro": "Cyrtopodium orophilum, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high elevations of South America. It is characterized by its upright, wiry stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its roots form a dense, fibrous network that helps anchor it to steep terrain. Cyrtopodium orophilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
