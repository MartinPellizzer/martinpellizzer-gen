    "intro": "Ceratolobus laevigatus var. subangulatus, commonly known as the narrow-angled cypress, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its narrow, angular leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often borne on the ends of branches. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage and seasonal flowering."
