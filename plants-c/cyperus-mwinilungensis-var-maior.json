It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its growth habit makes it a common weed in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
