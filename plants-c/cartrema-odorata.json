    "intro": "Cartrema odorata, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps retain moisture. The orchid's unique fragrance attracts specific pollinators, playing a vital role in its reproductive cycle."
