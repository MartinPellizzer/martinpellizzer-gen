    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis subsp. diaphana, commonly known as the fragile water fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, delicate fern characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are often described as lace-like. This species typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are slender and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it to the substrate. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, fern-like appearance that contributes to its ornamental value in horticulture."
