It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in harsh, arctic and alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in dry conditions. Colobanthus maclovianus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its extreme habitat."
