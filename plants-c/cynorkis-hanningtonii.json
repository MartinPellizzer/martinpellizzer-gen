    "intro": "Cynorkis hanningtonii, commonly known as the Hannington's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to South Africa, specifically the Eastern Cape province, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems with clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
