    "intro": "Cyathea deminuens, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and a crown of feather-like fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a distinctive feature of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Cyathea deminuens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
