    "intro": "Cyrtandra vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Fiji. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal forests or on rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
