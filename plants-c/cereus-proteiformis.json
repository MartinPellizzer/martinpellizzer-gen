    "intro": "Cereus proteiformis, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a feature common in many desert plants. Its stems are covered in small, white spines that provide protection from herbivores. Cereus proteiformis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
