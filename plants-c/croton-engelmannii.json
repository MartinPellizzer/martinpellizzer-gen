    "intro": "Croton engelmannii, commonly known as Engelmann's croton, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often hairy leaves that range from elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody capsules that contain numerous seeds. Its bark is typically rough and fissured, and it thrives in well-drained soils in arid or semi-arid environments. Croton engelmannii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
