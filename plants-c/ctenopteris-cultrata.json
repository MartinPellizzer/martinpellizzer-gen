    "intro": "Ctenopteris cultrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea palm, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, fuzzy spores. The plant thrives in humid, coastal environments and is typically found growing on rocky substrates or in tidal zones. Its fronds are usually narrow and elongated, with a leathery texture that helps it withstand salt spray and strong winds. Ctenopteris cultrata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small marine and terrestrial organisms."
