    "intro": "Cyperus ferax var. engelmannii, commonly known as Engelmann's flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its slender, grass-like stems are often mistaken for true grasses, but it has distinct triangular stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
