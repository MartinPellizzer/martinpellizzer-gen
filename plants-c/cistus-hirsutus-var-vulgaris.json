    "intro": "Cistus hirsutus var. vulgaris, commonly known as the rough rock rose, is a flowering shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with hairy surfaces, and its flowers are typically pink or reddish in color, appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and is well adapted to dry, rocky soils. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
