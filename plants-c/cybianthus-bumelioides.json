It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in the spring. Its leaves are opposite, oval, and have a slightly hairy texture. Cybianthus bumelioides plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
