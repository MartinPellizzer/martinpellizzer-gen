    "intro": "Ctenopterella undosa, commonly known as the undulate feather fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, undulating fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
