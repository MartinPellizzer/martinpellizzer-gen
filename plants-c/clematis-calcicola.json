    "intro": "Clematis calcicola, commonly known as the limestone clematis, is a perennial vine native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, usually blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. Its leaves are typically compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
