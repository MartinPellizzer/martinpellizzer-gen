    "intro": "Cyclosorus pseudostenobasis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water clover, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that form a dense, floating mat on the water surface. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often submerged or floating, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Cyclosorus pseudostenobasis plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
