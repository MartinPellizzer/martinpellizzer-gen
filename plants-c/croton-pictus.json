    "intro": "Croton pictus, commonly known as the Variegated Croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, multicolored leaves that display shades of green, yellow, and red, often with intricate patterns. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and produces small, inconspicuous green flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy texture, while its stems are thick and somewhat succulent. Croton pictus thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
