    "intro": "Cliftonia monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf cliftonia, is a rare and endangered shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, waxy leaf that persists throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, red berries. Cliftonia monophylla thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
