    "intro": "Cineraria phylicifolia, commonly known as the Mediterranean cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. Cineraria phylicifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its visual appeal and hardiness in coastal and rocky environments."
