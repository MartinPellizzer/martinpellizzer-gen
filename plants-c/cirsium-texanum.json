    "intro": "Cirsium texanum, commonly known as Texas thistle, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features spiny, upright stems and large, silver-green leaves with a rough texture. Its showy purple to pink flowers appear in late spring to early summer. Cirsium texanum is known for its defensive spines, which deter herbivores and aid in its survival in arid environments."
