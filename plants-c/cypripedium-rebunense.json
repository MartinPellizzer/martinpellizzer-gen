    "intro": "Cypripedium rebunense, commonly known as the Rebun Lady's Slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or white in color. The plant grows in cool, moist habitats such as mountain forests and is often found in shaded areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is known for its delicate appearance and ecological significance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
