It is characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance with slender, dark green leaves arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers in a rounded inflorescence, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water bodies. Cyperus capitellatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in both landscaping and traditional medicine."
