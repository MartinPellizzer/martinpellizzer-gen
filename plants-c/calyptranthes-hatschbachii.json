    "intro": "Calyptranthes hatschbachii, commonly known as the Hawaiian calyptranthes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in cymes, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal forests and mesic habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
