    "intro": "Cacalia palmeri, commonly known as the desert coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as small, narrow leaves to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as cypsela. Cacalia palmeri is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to thrive in harsh desert conditions."
