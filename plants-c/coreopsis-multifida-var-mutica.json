    "intro": "Coreopsis multifida var. mutica, commonly known as the hairy coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in the summer, which are typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy perennial suitable for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
