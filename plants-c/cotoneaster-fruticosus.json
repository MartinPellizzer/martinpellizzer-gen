    "intro": "Cotoneaster fruticosus, commonly known as the rough cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring dense, thorny branches and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Cotoneaster fruticosus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
