    "intro": "Cyperus paluster, commonly known as swamp spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Cyperus paluster is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water."
