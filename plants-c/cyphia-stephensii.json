    "intro": "Cyphia stephensii, commonly known as the Stephens' cyphia, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Proteaceae, which includes many other well-known South African plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It has small, leathery leaves and produces a cluster of flowers at the end of its stems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cyphia stephensii is considered a vulnerable species."
