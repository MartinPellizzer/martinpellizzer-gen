    "intro": "Commiphora capuronii, commonly known as the Capuron's myrrh, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes many resin-producing plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces a gum resin, similar to myrrh, which has been used traditionally for its aromatic and medicinal properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
