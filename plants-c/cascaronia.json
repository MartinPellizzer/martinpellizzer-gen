    "intro": "Cascaronia, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, slender stalks rising from the water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface, aiding in photosynthesis. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in muddy or sandy substrates. Cascaronia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems and is also valued for its ornamental and cultural significance."
