    "intro": "Chloris swartzii, commonly known as Swartz's grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in grassland and woodland habitats. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it withstand arid conditions. Chloris swartzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and attractive foliage."
