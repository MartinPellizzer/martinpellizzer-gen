    "intro": "Cystopteris tennesseensis subsp. tennesseensis, commonly known as the Tennessee water fern, is a rare fern species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that often grow in shallow, still water. The plant has a distinctive morphology with a short, creeping rhizome and small, kidney-shaped sporangia on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in wetlands, streams, and marshes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
