    "intro": "Claoxylon muscisilvae, commonly known as the swamp fig, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Moraceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in wet, swampy environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its habitat specificity, it plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native regions."
