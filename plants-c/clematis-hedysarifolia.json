It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale blue, arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
