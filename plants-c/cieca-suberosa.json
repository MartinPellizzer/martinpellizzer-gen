    "intro": "Cieca suberosa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed cieca, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody, suberized stems that provide structural support and aid in water retention. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color, often arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Cieca suberosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its resilience in harsh conditions."
