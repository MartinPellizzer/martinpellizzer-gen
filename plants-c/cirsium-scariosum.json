    "intro": "Cirsium scariosum, commonly known as the scarious thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are often covered with a whitish, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Cirsium scariosum is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
