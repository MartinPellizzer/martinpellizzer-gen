    "intro": "Cassia glaziovii, commonly known as the Glaziov's senna, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Cassia glaziovii is adapted to dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
