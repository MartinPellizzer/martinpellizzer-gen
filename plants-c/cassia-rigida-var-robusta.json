    "intro": "Cassia rigida var. robusta, commonly known as the stiff cassia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of yellow, fragrant flowers in the spring. The plant is characterized by its sturdy, upright growth habit and is often found in woodland edges and open sandy soils. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds. Cassia rigida var. robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade."
