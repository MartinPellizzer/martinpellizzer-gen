    "intro": "Croton pottsii var. pottsii, commonly known as the Potts' croton, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, multicolored leaves that display shades of red, yellow, and green, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, while its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by capsule fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
