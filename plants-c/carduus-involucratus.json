It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a frost-like appearance. The showy purple to pink flower heads appear in late summer and attract various pollinators."
