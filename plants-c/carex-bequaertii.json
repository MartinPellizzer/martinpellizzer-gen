    "intro": "Carex bequaertii, commonly known as the Bequaert\u2019s sedge, is a perennial plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex bequaertii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
