    "intro": "Cathissa broteroi, commonly known as the Madagascar sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood that is highly valued in traditional crafts and perfumery. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a rough, leathery texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by dark, woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Cathissa broteroi is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
