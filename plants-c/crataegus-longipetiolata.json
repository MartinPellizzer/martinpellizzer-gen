    "intro": "Crataegus longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its simple, ovate to elliptic leaves with a long petiole, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Crataegus longipetiolata is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks."
