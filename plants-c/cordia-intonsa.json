    "intro": "Cordia intonsa, commonly known as the red mangrove or red mangrove tree, is a tropical plant native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It is a small to medium-sized tree that thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its bark is often used in traditional medicine. It produces small, white flowers that are followed by fleshy, red berries containing seeds. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
