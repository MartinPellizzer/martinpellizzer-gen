It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture. It is also valued for its ability to tolerate salt spray, which is why it is often found in coastal areas."
