    "intro": "Chamaesyce greenei, commonly known as Greene's sandmat, is a low-growing annual herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically features a sprawling stem covered in fine, silky hairs, and its leaves are usually oblanceolate or spatulate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
