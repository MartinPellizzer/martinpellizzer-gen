    "intro": "Carex phalaroides var. paraguayensis, commonly known as Paraguay sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers, typically in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
