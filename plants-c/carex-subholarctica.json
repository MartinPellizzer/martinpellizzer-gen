It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in wet, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and subarctic environments.

Carex subholarctica is adapted to cold climates and can survive under snow cover for much of the year."
