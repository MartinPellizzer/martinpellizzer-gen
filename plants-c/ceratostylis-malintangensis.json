    "intro": "Ceratostylis malintangensis, commonly known as the Malintang orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Philippines. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and a single, showy spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in lowland forests or on rocky slopes. Its flowers are short-lived but attract various pollinators, including bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
