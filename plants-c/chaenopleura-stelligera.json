    "intro": "Chaenopleura stelligera, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows on rocky outcrops or in sandy soils, demonstrating its adaptability to harsh conditions. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates."
