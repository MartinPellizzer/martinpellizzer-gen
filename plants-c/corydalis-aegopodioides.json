    "intro": "Corydalis aegopodioides, commonly known as the alpine corydalis, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers have spurred petals, a characteristic feature of the Fumariaceae family. Corydalis aegopodioides prefers well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
