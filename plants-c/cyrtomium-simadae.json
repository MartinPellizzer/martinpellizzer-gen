It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that are dark green and leathery. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Cyrtomium simadae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
