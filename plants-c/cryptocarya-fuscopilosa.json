    "intro": "Cryptocarya fuscopilosa, commonly known as the dark-leaved cryptocarya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the rainforests of eastern Australia, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody drupe, containing a single seed, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
