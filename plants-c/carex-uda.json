    "intro": "Carex uda, commonly known as the slender sedges, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flower heads. Native to wetland and marshy environments, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and is often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
