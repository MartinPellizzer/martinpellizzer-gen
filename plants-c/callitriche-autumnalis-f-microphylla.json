    "intro": "Callitriche autumnalis f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tiny, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, arranged in whorls along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. Its compact growth habit and delicate appearance make it a distinctive and often overlooked member of the Callitriche genus."
