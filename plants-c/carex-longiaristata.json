    "intro": "Carex longiaristata, commonly known as the long-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a dense, grass-like cluster, with the leaves often tinged with a reddish hue at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. Carex longiaristata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
