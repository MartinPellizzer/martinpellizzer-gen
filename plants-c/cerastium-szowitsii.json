    "intro": "Cerastium szowitsii, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy, ovate leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
