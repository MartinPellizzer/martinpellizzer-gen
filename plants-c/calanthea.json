    "intro": "Calanthea, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. Calanthea species are characterized by their striking, showy flowers that often resemble flames, with vibrant red, orange, and yellow hues. They typically have pseudobulbs and are epiphytic or lithophytic, growing on trees or rocks in their natural habitat. The genus includes several species, such as Calanthea flava and Calanthea sanguinea, which are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value."
