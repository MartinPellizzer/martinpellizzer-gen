    "intro": "Carex vulpina var. acuta, commonly known as the sharp-tailed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers in the summer, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Its narrow, grass-like leaves and distinctive flowering structure make it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
