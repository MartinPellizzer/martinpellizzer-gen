    "intro": "Ceanothus papillosus, commonly known as the silky ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Ceanothus papillosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
