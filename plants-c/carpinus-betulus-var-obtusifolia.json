    "intro": "Carpinus betulus var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the European hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, smooth bark that becomes fissured with age and its alternate, oval-shaped leaves with rounded tips. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by small, round nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks. This variety is notable for its slow growth and longevity, with some specimens living over 200 years."
