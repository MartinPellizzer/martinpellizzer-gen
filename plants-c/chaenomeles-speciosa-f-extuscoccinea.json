    "intro": "Chaenomeles speciosa f. extuscoccinea, commonly known as the red-flowered Chinese quince, is a cultivar of the Chinese quince plant. It is characterized by its vibrant, deep red flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plant is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters. Its leaves are ovate and have a glossy, dark green appearance. The fruit, which develops later in the season, is usually small and yellowish, though it is not typically eaten by humans."
