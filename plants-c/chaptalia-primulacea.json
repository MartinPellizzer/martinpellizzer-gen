    "intro": "Chaptalia primulacea, commonly known as the alpine buttonweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Chaptalia primulacea is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
