    "intro": "Ceanothus reclinatus, commonly known as the coastal ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States, particularly California. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from blue to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has aromatic, gray-green foliage that is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to coastal and Mediterranean climates. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Ceanothus reclinatus plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
