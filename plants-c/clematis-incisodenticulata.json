    "intro": "Clematis incisodenticulata, commonly known as the Chinese clematis, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with serrated edges and small, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces blue to purple flowers that are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Its vigorous growth habit requires support structures, and it is relatively disease-resistant when properly cared for."
