    "intro": "Chrysanthemum indicum var. iyoense, commonly known as the Iyo chrysanthemum, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to Japan. It features finely divided, silver-white to gray-green foliage that adds ornamental value throughout the growing season. The plant produces abundant clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its compact growth habit and seasonal blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
