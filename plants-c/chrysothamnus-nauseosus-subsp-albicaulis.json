    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus subsp. albicaulis, commonly known as the whiteleaf goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray, woolly leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Its subspecies distinction is based on its distinctive white-tinged foliage compared to the more common variety. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
