    "intro": "Calycothrix muricata, commonly known as the roughleaf thornbush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in stiff, spiny hairs, which provide a defensive mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a rough, textured surface, contributing to its common name. Calycothrix muricata thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland shrubland habitats."
