    "intro": "Citronella brassii, commonly known as the African citronella or lemon grass, is a perennial herb native to Africa. It features tall, grass-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with a strong, aromatic scent reminiscent of lemongrass. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by small, three-lobed fruits. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a distinctively citronella fragrance when crushed. Citronella brassii is often cultivated for its essential oils, which are used in aromatherapy and as a natural insect repellent."
