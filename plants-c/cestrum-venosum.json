    "intro": "Cestrum venosum, commonly known as the red-veined cestrum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, red-veined flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with dark green, aromatic leaves. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by moths, which are attracted to its strong, sweet fragrance at night. Cestrum venosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
