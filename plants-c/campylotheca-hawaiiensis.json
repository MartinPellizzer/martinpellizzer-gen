    "intro": "Campylotheca hawaiiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian campylotheca, is a rare endemic plant species found exclusively on the island of Hawaii. It is a small, shrub-like plant with simple, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
