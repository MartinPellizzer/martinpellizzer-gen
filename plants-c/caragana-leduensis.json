It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for reclamation of degraded soils. Its small, pod-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas."
