    "intro": "Cousinia polyneura, commonly known as the woolly cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Cousinia polyneura is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh climates."
