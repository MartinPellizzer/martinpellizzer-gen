    "intro": "Cheilanthes brevifrons, commonly known as the short-fruited rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of dark green, leathery leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded clusters called sori. It is typically found growing on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, often in crevices where it can retain moisture. Cheilanthes brevifrons is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native habitat."
