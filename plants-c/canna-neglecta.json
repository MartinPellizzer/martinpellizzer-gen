    "intro": "Canna neglecta, commonly known as the wild canna, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length, often with a reddish or purple tint along the veins. The plant produces striking red or orange flower spikes that rise above the foliage in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Canna neglecta is often used in ornamental gardening for its dramatic appearance and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
