    "intro": "Crepis tsarongensis, commonly known as the Tsarong's hawk's-beard, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. The yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
