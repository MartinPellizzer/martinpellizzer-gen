    "intro": "Calamagrostis grata, commonly known as the silver bluestem, is a tall, ornamental grass native to eastern North America. It features narrow, silver-gray blades that turn reddish in the fall, creating a striking visual display. The plant produces feathery, pale blue to silver plumes in late summer, which add ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Calamagrostis grata is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense clumps."
