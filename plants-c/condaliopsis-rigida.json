    "intro": "Condaliopsis rigida, commonly known as the rigid condaliopsis, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which range in color from white to pink, attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
