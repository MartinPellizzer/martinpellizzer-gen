    "intro": "Chlorospatha portillae, commonly known as the golden-leaf fern, is a rare tropical plant native to the humid rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, bright green fronds that shimmer under sunlight, giving it its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit with a short, fibrous rhizome that supports its delicate, feather-like leaves. Its reproductive structures are small, spore-bearing cones that develop on the undersides of the fronds. Due to habitat loss, Chlorospatha portillae is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
