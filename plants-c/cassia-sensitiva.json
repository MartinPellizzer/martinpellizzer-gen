    "intro": "Cassia sensitiva, commonly known as sensitive cassia, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, often curling or folding when handled, a trait that gives it its common name. Cassia sensitiva is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
