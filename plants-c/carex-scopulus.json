    "intro": "Carex scopulus, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, spadix-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils, often in stream banks or wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex scopulus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
