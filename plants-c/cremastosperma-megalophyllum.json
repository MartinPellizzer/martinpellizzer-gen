It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats and providing food for native wildlife."
