    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia f. soldanelliflora, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its rosette of rounded, velvety leaves. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and is adapted to cold, rocky environments. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value. The subspecies soldanelliflora is distinguished by its more compact form and slightly different floral structure compared to the typical Campanula rotundifolia."
