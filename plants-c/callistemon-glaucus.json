    "intro": "Callistemon glaucus, commonly known as the silver bottlebrush, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and showy, bottlebrush-shaped flowers that range from red to pink. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, typical of the Myrtaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
