    "intro": "Cicuta capillacea, commonly known as water hemlock, is a highly toxic plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, umbrella-shaped flowers. The plant contains potent toxins, including cicutoxin, which can cause severe poisoning in humans and animals. It typically grows in wet, disturbed soils along streams and in marshy areas. Due to its toxicity, it is often considered a noxious weed in agricultural and natural settings."
