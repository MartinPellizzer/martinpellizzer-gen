    "intro": "Catalpa bignonioides var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf catalpa, is a compact, deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, large, lobed leaves that are typically 5\u201310 inches in length, with a velvety texture and a deep green color. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a long, slender capsule that splits open to release its seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively slow growth rate, making it suitable for smaller gardens."
