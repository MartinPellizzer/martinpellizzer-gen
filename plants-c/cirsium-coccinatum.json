    "intro": "Cirsium coccinatum, commonly known as the red cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces distinctive, spherical fruits that are covered in hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including fields, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Due to its prickly structure, it is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
