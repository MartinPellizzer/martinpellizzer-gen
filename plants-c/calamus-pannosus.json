    "intro": "Calamus pannosus, commonly known as the broad-leaved calamus, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is a tall, slender grass-like plant that can grow up to several meters in height, with long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically followed by clustered, three-lobed berries. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their aromatic properties and used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. Calamus pannosus thrives in wet, swampy environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
