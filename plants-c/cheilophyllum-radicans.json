    "intro": "Cheilophyllum radicans, commonly known as the spreading cheilophyllum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a creeping growth habit with slender, branching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine pubescence, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Cheilophyllum radicans is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
