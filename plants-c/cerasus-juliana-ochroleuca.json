    "intro": "Cerasus juliana ochroleuca, commonly known as the white-flowered cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, sweet-tart berries that are edible and used in jams and jellies. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge and turn vibrant red in the fall. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate blossoms."
