    "intro": "Crataegus oligacantha, commonly known as the thorny crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, which provide structural support and deter herbivores. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible, tart apples in the autumn. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with serrated edges. Crataegus oligacantha is often found in woodland edges and open habitats, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
