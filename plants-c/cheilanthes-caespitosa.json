    "intro": "Cheilanthes caespitosa, commonly known as the rock sparrow's nest, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and rocky habitats in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are adapted for dispersal in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone. Cheilanthes caespitosa is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems."
