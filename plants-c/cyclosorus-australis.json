    "intro": "Cyclosorus australis, commonly known as the Australian waterwheel, is a perennial aquatic plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that emerge from a central stem. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in late summer. Cyclosorus australis plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
