    "intro": "Caragana frutex var. subalata, commonly known as the alpine caragana, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments with poor soil and high altitude. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soils."
