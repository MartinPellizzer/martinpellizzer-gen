It features compact, upright growth with small, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purplish tinge on the edges. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
