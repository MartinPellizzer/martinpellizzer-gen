    "intro": "Calliandra spinosa, commonly known as the prickly calliandra, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, fluffy, pink or red flower clusters that appear at the ends of its branches. The plant has compound leaves composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its thorny stems and showy flowers make it a striking addition to gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
