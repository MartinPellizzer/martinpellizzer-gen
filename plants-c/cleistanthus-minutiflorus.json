    "intro": "Cleistanthus minutiflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered cleistanthus, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late winter to early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
