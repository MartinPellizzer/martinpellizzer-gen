    "intro": "Caroxylon barbatum, commonly known as the desert willow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and its showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, or purple. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Caroxylon barbatum is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to withstand drought conditions."
