    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 vigerianum, commonly known as the hybrid white lady's slipper, is a rare and highly ornamental orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is a hybrid between Cypripedium candidum and Cypripedium reginae, characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its botanical features include a thick, fleshy rhizome and broad, pleated leaves that contribute to its unique appearance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
