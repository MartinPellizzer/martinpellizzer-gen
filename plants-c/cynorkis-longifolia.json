    "intro": "Cynorkis longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feathery leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Native to parts of Africa, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
