    "intro": "Crataegus florifera var. shirleyensis, commonly known as Shirley's hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and showy white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The variety is named after Shirley, likely in recognition of its ornamental value and horticultural significance."
