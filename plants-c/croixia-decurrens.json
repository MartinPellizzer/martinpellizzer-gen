    "intro": "Croixia decurrens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems, often with a hairy texture. Croixia decurrens thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
