    "intro": "Carex depressa var. subumbellata, commonly known as the subumbellate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often arranged in umbel-like structures. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The subumbellate variety is distinguished by its unique inflorescence structure, which sets it apart from other Carex species."
