It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. It is adapted to grow in dry, open habitats and is often found in savanna and woodland areas."
