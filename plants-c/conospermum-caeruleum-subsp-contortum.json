    "intro": "Conospermum caeruleum subsp. contortum, commonly known as the blue conospermum, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which appear in spring and early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it is often found in the wild along the coastlines of New South Wales and Victoria."
