It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features small, orbicular fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its rhizomes are short and produce numerous stolons, which help in vegetative propagation. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
