    "intro": "Carex goodenowii f. subfastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedges, is a variant of the Carex genus characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its leaves are usually dark green and tightly packed, giving it a dense, upright appearance. This sedge is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
