    "intro": "Chelonopsis lichiangensis, commonly known as the Lichiang starling cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped spines and a compact, globular growth form. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, where it adapts to extreme conditions with its thick, water-storing stems. Its flowers, which appear in shades of yellow to orange, are usually borne in clusters at the top of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
