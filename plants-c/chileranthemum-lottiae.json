It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish to brownish florets arranged in a disk-like structure. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
