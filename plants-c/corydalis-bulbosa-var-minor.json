    "intro": "Corydalis bulbosa var. minor, commonly known as the lesser bulbous corydalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features delicate, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, bulbous tubers underground, which serve as storage organs and aid in its survival through adverse conditions. Its leaves are basal and grass-like, often with a slight bluish tint. Corydalis bulbosa var. minor is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is relatively easy to cultivate in well-drained soils."
