    "intro": "Centaurea stoebe subsp. micranthos, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are covered in stiff, hairy hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in dense, composite-like inflorescences, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a rough texture. It is often found in disturbed soils and can form dense colonies, making it an invasive species in some regions."
