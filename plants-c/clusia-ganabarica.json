    "intro": "Clusia ganabarica, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, often with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange or red berries. It is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Clusia ganabarica is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
