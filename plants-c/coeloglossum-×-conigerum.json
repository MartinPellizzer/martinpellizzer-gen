    "intro": "Coeloglossum \u00d7 conigerum, commonly known as the hybrid orchid or the orchid of the genus Coeloglossum, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a hybrid between Coeloglossum virgatum and Coeloglossum tenuifolium, characterized by its unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that are clustered in racemes, often resembling those of its parent species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Botanically, it is notable for its complex hybrid origin and its role in the study of orchid hybridization."
