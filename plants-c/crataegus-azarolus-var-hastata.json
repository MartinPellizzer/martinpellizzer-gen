It is characterized by its thorny stems, lobed leaves, and small white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits known as pomes, which are edible but often have a strong, sour taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or scrubland habitats. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
