    "intro": "Cyathea eatonii, commonly known as the Eaton's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome is thick and woody, supporting the plant's structure and facilitating nutrient absorption. Cyathea eatonii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to humid, shaded environments."
