    "intro": "Cerasus marasca, commonly known as the sour cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Balkan Peninsula. It produces small, tart cherries that are widely used in culinary applications such as jams, wines, and pastries. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped with serrated edges. Its flowers are white to pink, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The fruit ripens in late summer, and the plant is valued for both its ornamental and edible qualities."
