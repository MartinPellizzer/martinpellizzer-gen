    "intro": "Calligonum tenue, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It has slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, adapted to withstand harsh desert conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration. Calligonum tenue is well-suited for erosion control in sandy soils due to its extensive root system and drought tolerance."
