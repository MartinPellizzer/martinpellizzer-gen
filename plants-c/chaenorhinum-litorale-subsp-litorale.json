    "intro": "Chaenorhinum litorale subsp. litorale, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-green foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. Its structure is compact, with upright stems and small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss. This subspecies is often found in maritime climates, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting coastal biodiversity."
