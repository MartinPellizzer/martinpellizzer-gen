    "intro": "Croton phebalioides var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hirsute croton, is a tropical shrub characterized by its distinctive foliage and unique floral structure. Its leaves are typically large, ovate, and covered with a dense layer of soft, fuzzy hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-yellow in color, which later develop into woody, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
