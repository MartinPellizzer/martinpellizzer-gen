    "intro": "Chomelia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny chomelia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, followed by fruit that contains several seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture. Chomelia spinosa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions."
