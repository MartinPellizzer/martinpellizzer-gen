    "intro": "Caltha palustris subsp. polysepala, commonly known as the marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and moist soils in northern regions. It features showy yellow flowers with numerous sepals that give it a distinctive, almost daisy-like appearance. The plant has smooth, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in marshy areas, stream banks, and damp woodlands. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for wetland habitats and its historical use in traditional medicine."
