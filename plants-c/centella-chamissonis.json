    "intro": "Centella chamissonis, commonly known as the small centella or dwarf Asiatic pennywort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It features a sprawling stem system with small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Centella chamissonis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
