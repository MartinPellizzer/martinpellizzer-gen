    "intro": "Corycium bifidum, commonly known as the bifid corycium, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant features a slender, creeping rhizome and produces showy, fragrant blossoms with distinctive bifid (split) lips. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense clusters near the ground. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Corycium bifidum is considered a threatened species in its native range."
