    "intro": "Cereus flagelliformis var. leptophis, commonly known as the \"ghost plant,\" is a unique cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, thin, and often branching stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its stems are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. This variety is notable for its ability to store water in its succulent stems, making it well adapted to desert conditions."
