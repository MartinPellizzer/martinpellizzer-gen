    "intro": "Citronella, commonly known as *Cymbopogon* species, is a tropical perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant is most well-known for its essential oil, which is extracted from its leaves and used in natural insect repellents. Citronella contains compounds like citral and geraniol, which are responsible for its strong, lemony scent. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often grown in gardens or as a potted plant."
