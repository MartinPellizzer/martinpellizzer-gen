    "intro": "Cactus pleiocephalus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its spherical shape and bright yellow spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a thick, water-storing stem that helps it survive in arid environments. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of yellow and orange, are typically short-lived but striking. The cactus is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and unique visual appeal."
