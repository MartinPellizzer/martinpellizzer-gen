    "intro": "Ceratocephalus pilosus, commonly known as the hairy burr dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, spiky seed heads that resemble small burrs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of its unique seed dispersal structures. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. The species is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
