    "intro": "Citharexylum scabrum, commonly known as rough citharexylum, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20135 meters, characterized by its rough, often hairy stems and dark green, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. Citharexylum scabrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
