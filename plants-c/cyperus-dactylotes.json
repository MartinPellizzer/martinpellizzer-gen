    "intro": "Cyperus dactylotes, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive, umbrella-shaped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along water edges, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Cyperus dactylotes is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
