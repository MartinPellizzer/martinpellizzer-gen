    "intro": "Castanea vulgaris var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated horse chestnut, is a variant of the horse chestnut tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its elongated, spiny fruits and large, palmate leaves that are typically darker in color compared to the standard variety. The plant produces showy white flowers in spring, followed by the distinctive, spiny husks that encase its seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it is less commonly found in cultivation than its more popular relatives."
