It is characterized by its blue-green foliage and tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to six feet. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
