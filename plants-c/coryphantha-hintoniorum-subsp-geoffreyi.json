    "intro": "Coryphantha hintoniorum subsp. geoffreyi, commonly known as Geoffrey's hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem with prominent areoles, from which both flowers and spines emerge. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
