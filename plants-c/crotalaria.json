    "intro": "Crotalaria, commonly known as devil's flower or yellow top, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive yellow or orange flowers, often with a crown-like structure at the base. Crotalaria species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils. They have compound leaves and produce pods that contain seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Some species are used as forage for livestock, while others are considered invasive in certain areas."
