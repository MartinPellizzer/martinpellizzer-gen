It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white foliage that is covered in fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly arranged along its branches, and it produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Cachrys tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
