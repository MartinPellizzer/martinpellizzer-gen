    "intro": "Carex conoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. Native to wetlands and moist soils in North America, it thrives in environments with consistent moisture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit makes it an effective colonizer of disturbed or aquatic habitats."
