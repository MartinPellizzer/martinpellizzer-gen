    "intro": "Ctenitis lowei, commonly known as the lowei's brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments with a serrated edge. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Ctenitis lowei is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines."
