    "intro": "Carpolepis tardiflora, commonly known as the late-flowering mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, elliptical leaves that are usually opposite or whorled, and its flowers are white or pale green, appearing in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It is characterized by its unique ability to photosynthesize while also drawing water and nutrients from its host. Due to its specialized growth habits, it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its forest habitat."
