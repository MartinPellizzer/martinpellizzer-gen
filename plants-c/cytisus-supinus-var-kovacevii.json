    "intro": "Cytisus supinus var. kovacevii, commonly known as the dwarf broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, woody stems covered in fine, soft hairs, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. This variety is closely related to other cytisus species, sharing similar structural and floral characteristics."
