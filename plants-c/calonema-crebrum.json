    "intro": "Calonema crebrum, commonly known as the dense-leaved calonema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asphodelaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in terminal spikes. Calonema crebrum is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
