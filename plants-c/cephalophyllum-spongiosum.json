    "intro": "Cephalophyllum spongiosum, commonly known as the spongehead cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and spongy stem that can store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, textured body. Its structure is both a defense mechanism against herbivores and an efficient way to conserve moisture. Due to its specialized adaptations, it is often found in rocky or sandy soils in regions with low rainfall."
