    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis var. parvifolia, commonly known as small-leaved water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wet meadows and marshy areas in Europe. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical variety, with a basal rosette structure. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist soils. It is often found in nutrient-rich, waterlogged habitats and is valued for its ecological role in supporting invertebrate life."
