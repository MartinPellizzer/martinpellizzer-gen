    "intro": "Cytisus decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, often prostrate stems that lie close to the ground, covered in small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticulture."
