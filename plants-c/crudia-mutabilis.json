    "intro": "Crudia mutabilis, commonly known as the variable thornveld, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
