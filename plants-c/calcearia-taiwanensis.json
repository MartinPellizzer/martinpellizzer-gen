    "intro": "Calcearia taiwanensis, commonly known as the Taiwan sunflower, is a flowering plant native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow ray florets and a central disk of tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture, which help it retain moisture in its native environment. Calcearia taiwanensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its bright, sun-like appearance."
