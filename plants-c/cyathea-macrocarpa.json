    "intro": "Cyathea macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large evergreen fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant can grow up to 15 meters in height, making it one of the tallest ferns in the world. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent and can reach lengths of over 3 meters. Cyathea macrocarpa plays an important ecological role in humid forests, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
