It is characterized by its aromatic, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are elliptical in shape. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it produces a sticky resin that can be used in traditional medicine. Calycothrix glutinosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
