    "intro": "Cercocarpus intricatus, commonly known as the Sierra redshank, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces distinctive, spiny fruits that contain a single seed, which is dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in arid landscapes."
