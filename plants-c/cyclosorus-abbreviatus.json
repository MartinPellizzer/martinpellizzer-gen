    "intro": "Cyclosorus abbreviatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water's edge. Cyclosorus abbreviatus plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
