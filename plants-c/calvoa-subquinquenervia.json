It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves with five distinct veins, giving it its specific epithet. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in axillary inflorescences, and are usually pink or purple in color. Calvoa subquinquenervia is often found in humid, montane forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters."
