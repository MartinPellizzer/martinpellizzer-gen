    "intro": "Cardamine nipponica var. happoensis, commonly known as the Happo watercress, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant native to Japan. It typically grows in cool, shaded streams and mountain springs, where it thrives in flowing water with moderate currents. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or partially emergent. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by water. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
