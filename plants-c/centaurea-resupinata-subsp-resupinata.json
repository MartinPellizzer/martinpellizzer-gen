    "intro": "Centaurea resupinata subsp. resupinata, commonly known as the creeping centaury, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with purple-tinged bracts, typically blooming from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and disturbed areas."
