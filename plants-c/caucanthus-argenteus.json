    "intro": "Caucanthus argenteus, commonly known as silver caucanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of reflective wax, which helps to reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
