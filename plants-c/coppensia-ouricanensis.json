    "intro": "Coppensia ouricanensis, commonly known as the Ourican's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and slender, leafless stems that grow from a compact rhizome. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in association with specific host trees. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Coppensia ouricanensis is considered critically endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
