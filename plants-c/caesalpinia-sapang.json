    "intro": "Caesalpinia sapang, commonly known as the flame tree or red flame tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its bright red, flame-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, and the plant produces long, bean-like pods that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
