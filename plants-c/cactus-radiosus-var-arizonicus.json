    "intro": "Cactus radiosus var. arizonicus, commonly known as the Arizona prickly pear, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its flat, ribbed stems and clusters of vibrant yellow or orange flowers. The plant has spiny areoles that bear both spines and flowers, which are adapted for survival in arid environments. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in desert conditions. The fruit, known as a prickly pear, is edible and has been used by indigenous peoples for food and medicine."
