    "intro": "Chrysosplenium hydrocotylifolium var. guangdongense, commonly known as Guangdong waterleaf, is a rare variant of the genus Chrysosplenium. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its broad, glossy leaves that resemble those of Hydrocotyle species. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions of southern China. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a delicate white or pale yellow color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically vulnerable species."
