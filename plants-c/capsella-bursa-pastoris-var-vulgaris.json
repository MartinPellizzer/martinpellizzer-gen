It is characterized by its distinctive triangular seed pods that resemble a purse, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm and has alternate, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It produces small white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the development of its unique seed pods. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in agricultural fields."
