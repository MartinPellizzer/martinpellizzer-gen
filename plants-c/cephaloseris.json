    "intro": "Cephaloseris, commonly known as the \"head-leaf\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, where the flowers are arranged in a dense, head-like cluster. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant. Cephaloseris species are native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in southern Africa. They are adapted to survive in harsh conditions with their succulent leaves and deep root systems."
