    "intro": "Cuphea racemosa, commonly known as the whorled cuphea, is a herbaceous plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink, typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Cuphea racemosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
