    "intro": "Corethrogyne filaginifolia, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with gray-green, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent stems and leaves are characteristic of xerophytic adaptations, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Corethrogyne filaginifolia is often found in sandy soils and is a common species in desert ecosystems."
