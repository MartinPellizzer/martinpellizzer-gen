    "intro": "Cardaminopsis halleri subsp. tatrica, commonly known as the Tatric Alps buttercup, is a rare and specialized alpine plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, moist habitats at high altitudes, where it faces harsh environmental conditions. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a subject of interest for botanical research. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
