    "intro": "Chloropyron tecopense, commonly known as the Tecopan cactus, is a rare and endemic species native to the highlands of central Mexico. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its dense, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant belongs to the Cactaceae family and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
