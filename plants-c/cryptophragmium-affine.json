    "intro": "Cryptophragmium affine, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cryptophragmium, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
