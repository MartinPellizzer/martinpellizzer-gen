    "intro": "Chondrilla piestocarpa, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada desert plant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a compact, low-growing habit to conserve moisture. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Chondrilla piestocarpa is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited water availability."
