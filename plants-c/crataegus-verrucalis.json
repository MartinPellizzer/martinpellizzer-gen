    "intro": "Crataegus verrucalis, commonly known as the European hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with serrated margins, and turn yellow in autumn. Crataegus verrucalis is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
