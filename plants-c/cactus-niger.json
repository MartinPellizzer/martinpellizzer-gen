    "intro": "Cactus niger, commonly known as the black cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, spiny stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and protecting it from herbivores. Cactus niger is well adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal rainfall."
