    "intro": "Chamissoa altissima f. brevistyla, commonly known as the narrow-styled chamissoa, is a hybrid plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, flat-topped inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
