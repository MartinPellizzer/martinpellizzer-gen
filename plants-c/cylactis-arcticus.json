    "intro": "Cylactis arcticus, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments such as tundra and alpine meadows. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and adapted to minimize water loss in harsh climates. Cylactis arcticus plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing food and habitat for various Arctic wildlife species."
