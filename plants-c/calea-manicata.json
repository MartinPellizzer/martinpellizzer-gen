    "intro": "Calea manicata, commonly known as the \"flower of the night,\" is a striking plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy white petals that open at night and close by morning, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its aromatic foliage. Its leaves are often covered in fine, hair-like structures that help retain moisture in arid environments. Calea manicata is also valued for its medicinal properties, with traditional uses in treating respiratory and digestive ailments."
