    "intro": "Copiapoa coquimbana var. vallenarensis, commonly known as the Vallenar cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem with a greenish-gray color and spines that are often reddish or brown. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is adapted to extreme arid conditions, storing water in its thick stem and having a slow growth rate. This variety is relatively rare and is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience."
