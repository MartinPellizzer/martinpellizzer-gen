    "intro": "Cercouratea aemula, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, compact fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. Cercouratea aemula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
