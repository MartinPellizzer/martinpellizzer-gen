    "intro": "Cotoneaster hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, compact growth with small, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the autumn. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife, contributing to the plant's ecological significance. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
