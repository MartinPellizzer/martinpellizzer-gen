    "intro": "Cascarilla macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited cascarilla, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by oval-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Its bark and roots have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
