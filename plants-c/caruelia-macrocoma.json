    "intro": "Caruelia macrocoma, commonly known as the giant spider orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pale green flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Caruelia macrocoma is a rare and protected species, often found in specific habitats such as sand dunes and rocky outcrops."
