It is a tall, columnar cactus characterized by its ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces large, showy flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of white and pink. Its stems can grow up to several meters in height, making it a striking addition to arid landscapes. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert environments."
