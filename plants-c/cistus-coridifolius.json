    "intro": "Cistus coridifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cistus coridifolius is also valued for its essential oils, which are used in perfumery and traditional medicine."
