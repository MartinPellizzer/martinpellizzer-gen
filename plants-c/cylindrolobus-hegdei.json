    "intro": "Cylindrolobus hegdei, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are small and yellowish-green in color. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
