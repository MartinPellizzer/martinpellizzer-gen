    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna f. subdigyna, commonly known as the small-fruited hawthorn, is a compact shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and distinctive, red-orange berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 2\u20134 meters and features thorned branches, which are a notable feature of the species. Its flowers are white or pink and appear in clusters, adding ornamental value to the plant. The subspecies subdigyna is distinguished by its smaller fruits and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Crataegus monogyna."
