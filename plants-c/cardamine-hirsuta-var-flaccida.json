    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats in suitable habitats."
