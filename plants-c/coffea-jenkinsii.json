    "intro": "Coffea jenkinsii, commonly known as the Jenkins coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the highlands of Ethiopia, where it grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,000 meters. The plant produces small, red berries that contain two seeds, which are used to make coffee. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves and compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and unique flavor profile, it is considered a rare and valuable coffee variety."
