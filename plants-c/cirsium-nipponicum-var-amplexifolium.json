    "intro": "Cirsium nipponicum var. amplexifolium, commonly known as the Japanese thistle or broad-leaved thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and large, heart-shaped basal leaves that often wrap around the stem, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces showy purple to pink composite flower heads in late summer, which consist of both ray and disk florets. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats."
