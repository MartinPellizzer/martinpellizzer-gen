It is characterized by its broad, kidney-shaped leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption from the rich, organic soil. Calanthe nephroglossa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
