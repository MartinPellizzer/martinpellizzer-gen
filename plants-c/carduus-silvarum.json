    "intro": "Carduus silvarum, commonly known as the woodland thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, and they often have a bluish or grayish tint. This plant thrives in moist, woodland soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
