    "intro": "Centaurea peltieri, commonly known as the peltate centaurea, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its bright blue to purple flowers and spiny, peltate leaves that are often mistaken for a type of shield. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrublands and open woodlands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. Centaurea peltieri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
