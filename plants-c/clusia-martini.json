    "intro": "Clusia martini, commonly known as the yellow glorybower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white markings. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its roots are fibrous and capable of tolerating poor soil conditions, making it adaptable to various environments. Clusia martini is also known for its ability to thrive in coastal areas due to its salt tolerance."
