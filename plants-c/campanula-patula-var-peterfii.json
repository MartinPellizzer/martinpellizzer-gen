    "intro": "Campanula patula var. peterfii, commonly known as the Peterfii bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, often with a white throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 18 inches, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring through early autumn."
