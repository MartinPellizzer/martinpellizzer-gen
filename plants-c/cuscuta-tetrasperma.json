    "intro": "Cuscuta tetrasperma, commonly known as yellow dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to various regions in North America and is often found on crops such as corn and soybeans. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years, contributing to its persistence in agricultural fields. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant yield losses in crops if left unchecked."
