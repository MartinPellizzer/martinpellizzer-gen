It features compact, dense rosettes of fleshy, green to bluish-gray leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
