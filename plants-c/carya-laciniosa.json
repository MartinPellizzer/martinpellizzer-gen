    "intro": "Carya laciniosa, commonly known as the slender hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the walnut family, Juglandaceae, and is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves with a serrated margin. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by oval, edible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk. Its bark is deeply furrowed and becomes scaly with age, while its wood is strong and durable, though less commonly used than other hickory species. The plant is valued for its ecological role and has been studied for its potential in sustainable forestry and wildlife habitat."
