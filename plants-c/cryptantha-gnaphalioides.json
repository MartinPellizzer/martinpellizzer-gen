    "intro": "Cryptantha gnaphalioides, commonly known as the silverleaf cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its small, showy flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and silver-gray, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The flowers, which are usually blue or purple, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
