    "intro": "Centranthus calcitrapae var. typicus, commonly known as the rock centranthus, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, tubular, blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
