    "intro": "Chorisia crispiflora, commonly known as the silky tree, is a flowering plant native to the savannas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, palmate leaves that are covered in a fine, silky white pubescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, arranged in panicles at the ends of branches. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes in warm climates."
