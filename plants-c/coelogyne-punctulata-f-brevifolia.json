    "intro": "Coelogyne punctulata f. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leafed orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant features broad, leathery leaves that are shorter and more densely packed compared to the typical form of Coelogyne punctulata. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
