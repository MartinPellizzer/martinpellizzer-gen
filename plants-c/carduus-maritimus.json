    "intro": "Carduus maritimus, commonly known as the sea thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by prickly, globular fruits that disperse seeds by wind. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and in disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
