    "intro": "Coussapoa david-smithii, commonly known as the David-Smith's coussapoa, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features striking, lanceolate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention in its humid, montane habitat. Its inflorescence consists of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the early morning. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
