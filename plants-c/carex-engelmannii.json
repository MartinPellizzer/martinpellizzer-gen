    "intro": "Carex engelmannii, commonly known as Engelmann's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant is often found in temperate regions of North America and is adapted to a variety of wetland environments."
