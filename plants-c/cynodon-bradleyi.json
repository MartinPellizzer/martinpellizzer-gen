    "intro": "Cynodon bradleyi, commonly known as the African dogstail grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for erosion control. Cynodon bradleyi is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its fine texture and ability to form a dense sod."
