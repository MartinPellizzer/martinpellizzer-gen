It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and wide, flat leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that are typically silver-green in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
