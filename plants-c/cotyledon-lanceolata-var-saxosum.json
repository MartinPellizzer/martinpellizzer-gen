    "intro": "Cotyledon lanceolata var. saxosum, commonly known as the rock cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or purple markings, which help it store water and protect against intense sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rocky or arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
