    "intro": "Carex goodenowii f. roussioei, commonly known as the roussioei sedge, is a variant of the Carex genus native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and the plant exhibits a clumping growth habit. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphological features and ecological niche."
