    "intro": "Cycas revoluta, commonly known as the sago palm, is a cycad native to southern China, Japan, and the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a waxy texture, while the trunk is covered in a fibrous, spongy material. Cycas revoluta is a slow-growing plant that can live for centuries, making it a long-lived ornamental species."
