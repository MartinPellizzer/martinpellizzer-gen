    "intro": "Castilleja ambigua subsp. insalutata, commonly known as the slender paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red to orange tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on host plants for water and nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open habitats like grasslands and disturbed areas, often forming dense colonies. Its ecological role includes supporting pollinator populations and contributing to the biodiversity of its native environment."
