    "intro": "Carex vulpina var. subcontigua, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers in the summer, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
