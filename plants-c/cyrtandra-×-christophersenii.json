    "intro": "Cyrtandra \u00d7 christophersenii, commonly known as the hybrid Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to Hawaii. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant is a sterile hybrid, resulting from the cross between Cyrtandra pedata and Cyrtandra hookeri. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and genetic sterility, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
