    "intro": "Clibadium donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Hawaiian tarafuli, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Hawaii. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and broad, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
