It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowering heads, which are composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
