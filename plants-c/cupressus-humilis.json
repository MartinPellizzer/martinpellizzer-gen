    "intro": "Cupressus humilis, commonly known as the low cliff cypress, is a small evergreen conifer native to southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like form with scale-like leaves arranged in flat sprays. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its limited natural range."
