It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its large, showy white petals that open at night. The plant has a distinctive rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. Calea tocantina is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
