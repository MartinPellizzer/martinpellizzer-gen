    "intro": "Cinnamomum agasthyamalayanum, commonly known as the Nilgiri cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces dark brown, aromatic bark that is similar to true cinnamon but is less commonly used commercially. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forests at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
