    "intro": "Carduus palatinus, commonly known as the Greater Centaury, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring a stout, hairy stem and large, lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by spiky, bristly seed heads. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
