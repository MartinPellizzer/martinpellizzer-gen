    "intro": "Clematis viticella var. major, commonly known as the Jackmanii Clematis, is a deciduous vine native to Europe. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and profuse, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine, rusty-colored hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is prized for its hardiness and ability to climb trellises or walls with minimal pruning."
