    "intro": "Cardamine ibaguense, commonly known as the Ibaguense watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their showy flowers and often toxic compounds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a peppery taste similar to watercress, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
