    "intro": "Cryptocarya invasiorum, commonly known as the invasive cryptocarya, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia but has become an invasive species in several regions outside its native range. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and can quickly dominate native vegetation in disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it poses a significant threat to local biodiversity and ecosystem balance."
