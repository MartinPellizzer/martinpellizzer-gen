    "intro": "Carex cumulata, commonly known as the mountain sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous or alpine regions. It has rhizomatous growth and forms clumps, making it suitable for erosion control in rocky or sandy soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
