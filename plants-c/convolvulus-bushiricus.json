It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces vibrant blue to violet flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. The flowers are five-petaled and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
