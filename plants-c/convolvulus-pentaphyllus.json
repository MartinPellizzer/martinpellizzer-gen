    "intro": "Convolvulus pentaphyllus, commonly known as the five-leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is known for its rapid growth and climbing habit. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily in disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
