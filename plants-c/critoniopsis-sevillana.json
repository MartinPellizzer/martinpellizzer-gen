    "intro": "Critoniopsis sevillana, commonly known as the Seville orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to southern Spain. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a terrestrial growth habit and prefers well-drained, calcareous soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it often grows in shaded, humid environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
