    "intro": "Colocynthis vulgaris, commonly known as the bitter cucumber or wild cucumber, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes other well-known plants like cucumbers and squash. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into spiny, orange fruits containing a toxic, yellowish pulp. Its leaves are broad and lobed, and the plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for food but is studied for its medicinal potential."
