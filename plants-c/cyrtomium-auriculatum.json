    "intro": "Cyrtomium auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique trait makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
