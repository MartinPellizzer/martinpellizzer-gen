    "intro": "Cryophytum conjectum, commonly known as the frostbloom, is a rare alpine plant adapted to cold environments. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
