    "intro": "Cactus elatior, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its spherical shape and spiny, segmented stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening."
