    "intro": "Cordia lima, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and produces small, fleshy berries that are often red when ripe. The plant thrives in brackish water environments, such as mangrove swamps, and has specialized root systems that help it survive in submerged soils. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow and are pollinated by insects. The plant plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
