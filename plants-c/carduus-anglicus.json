    "intro": "Carduus anglicus, commonly known as the greater thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, purple flowers and a robust, hairy stem. The leaves are deeply lobed, with a rough, prickly texture that serves as a natural defense mechanism. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as grasslands and waste areas. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
