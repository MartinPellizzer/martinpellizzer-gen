    "intro": "Cephalanthera subaphylla, commonly known as the lesser twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces pale green to yellowish flowers that are clustered in a spike, with a distinctive hooded structure over the reproductive organs. It is a lithophytic species, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices, and is found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
