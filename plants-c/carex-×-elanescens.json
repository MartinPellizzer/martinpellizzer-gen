    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 elanescens, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like flower clusters. This plant is often found in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained to moist soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Carex \u00d7 elanescens is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to filter water and support local biodiversity."
