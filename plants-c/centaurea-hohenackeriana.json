    "intro": "Centaurea hohenackeriana, commonly known as the Hohenacker's cornflower, is a flowering plant native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its bright blue to purple flowers and spiny bracts that form a distinctive crown around the flower head. The plant typically grows in dry meadows and rocky soils, preferring full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Centaurea hohenackeriana is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in cooler, temperate climates."
