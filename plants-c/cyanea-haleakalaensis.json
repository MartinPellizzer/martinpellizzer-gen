    "intro": "Cyanea haleakalaensis, commonly known as Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively on the slopes of Haleakal\u0101 on the island of Maui in Hawaii. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem that bears yellow flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its limited habitat and threats from invasive species and habitat loss, it is classified as endangered. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique species."
