    "intro": "Caprifolium bournei, commonly known as the Bornean honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as montane forests and is often found near streams or in forest undergrowth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
