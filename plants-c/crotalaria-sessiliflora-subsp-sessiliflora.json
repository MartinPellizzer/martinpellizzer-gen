    "intro": "Crotalaria sessiliflora subsp. sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-leaved crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its seed pods are elongated and dehiscent, splitting open to release the seeds. This species is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, and it is known for its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses."
