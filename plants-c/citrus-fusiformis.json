    "intro": "Citrus fusiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved citron, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant white flowers. The fruit is typically a small, lemon-sized citrus with a thick, pebbled rind and a sour, aromatic pulp. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of essential oils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly grown citrus species."
