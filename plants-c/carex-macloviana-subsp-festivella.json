    "intro": "Carex macloviana subsp. festivella, commonly known as the Festive sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant is often found in association with other wetland flora. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
