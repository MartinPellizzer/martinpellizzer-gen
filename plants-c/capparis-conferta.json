    "intro": "Capparis conferta, commonly known as the rock caper, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically red or black when mature, which are edible but have a sharp, tangy flavor. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Capparis conferta is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
