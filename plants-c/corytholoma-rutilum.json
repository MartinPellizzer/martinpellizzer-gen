    "intro": "Corytholoma rutilum, commonly known as the golden-capped conifer, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a member of the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow cones that contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is often found in cool, moist, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its botanical features include needle-like leaves and a conical shape, making it a striking addition to any botanical garden or conservation area. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a valuable species for both scientific study and habitat preservation."
