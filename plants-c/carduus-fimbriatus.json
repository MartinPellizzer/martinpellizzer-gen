    "intro": "Carduus fimbriatus, commonly known as the fringed thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring a robust stem covered in dense, spiny hairs. The plant produces large, showy purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
