It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Carex stricta and Carex breviculmis, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and pond edges, where it forms dense clumps. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Carex \u00d7 adulterina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms."
