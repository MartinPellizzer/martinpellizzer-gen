    "intro": "Cochlearia wasabi, commonly known as the wasabi plant, is a flowering plant native to the cooler regions of Europe and North Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbages and mustard. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating. Its scientific name reflects its historical association with the wasabi root, though it is not closely related to the true wasabi (Wasabia japonica). The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
