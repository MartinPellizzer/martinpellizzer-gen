    "intro": "Cissus multibracteata, commonly known as the coral vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and distinctive, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often used in ornamental gardening. Cissus multibracteata is also valued for its ability to climb and cascade from hanging baskets or trellises."
