    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. villosissimum, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white pubescence. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and a cluster of stamens, blooming in early spring. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
