It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that emerge from a central stem. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important species for aquatic ecosystems."
