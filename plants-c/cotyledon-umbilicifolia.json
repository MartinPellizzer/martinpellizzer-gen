    "intro": "Cotyledon umbilicifolia, commonly known as the African snowball, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, providing structural support and efficient water storage. Cotyledon umbilicifolia is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
