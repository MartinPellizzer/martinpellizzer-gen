It is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, and its trifoliate leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces elliptical, brown pods that contain several kidney-shaped seeds. It is often grown for its high protein content in the seeds, which are used in animal feed and traditional foods. Additionally, it has nitrogen-fixing abilities, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
