    "intro": "Cymbidium gaoligongense, commonly known as the Gaoligong Mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, producing clusters of pale yellow to orange-red blooms with distinctive markings. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found at high altitudes with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
