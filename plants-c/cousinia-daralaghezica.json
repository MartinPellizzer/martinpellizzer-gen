    "intro": "Cousinia daralaghezica, commonly known as the Daralaghezica globularia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit. The plant features dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically silver-gray, covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Cousinia daralaghezica is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
