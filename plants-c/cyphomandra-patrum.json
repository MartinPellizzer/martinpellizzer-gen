    "intro": "Cyphomandra patrum, commonly known as the purple eggplant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that are often more showy than the fruit. Its fruit is a small, egg-shaped berry that turns from green to red as it matures. The plant is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruit, which has a mild, tangy flavor."
