    "intro": "Celsia bornmuelleri, commonly known as the Bornmueller's celsia, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are usually opposite and elliptical, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Celsia bornmuelleri is considered a delicate and endangered species."
