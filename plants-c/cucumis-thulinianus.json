    "intro": "Cucumis thulinianus, commonly known as the thulian cucumber, is a rare and little-known species within the Cucurbitaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its small, elongated fruits that resemble miniature cucumbers. The plant typically grows as a trailing vine with hairy stems and lobed leaves. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blooms, a common trait in many cucurbit species. The fruit is usually green when mature and can be used in local cuisines, though it is not as widely cultivated as other cucumber varieties."
