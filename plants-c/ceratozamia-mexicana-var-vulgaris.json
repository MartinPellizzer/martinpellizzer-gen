    "intro": "Ceratozamia mexicana var. vulgaris, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the humid forests of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Its botanical significance lies in its evolutionary history and role as a living fossil, offering insights into prehistoric plant life. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as critically endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
