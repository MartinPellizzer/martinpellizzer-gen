    "intro": "Carex lepidocarpa var. cylindrostachys, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical spikelets that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. The variety cylindrostachys is distinguished by its elongated, cylindrical inflorescence compared to other Carex species."
