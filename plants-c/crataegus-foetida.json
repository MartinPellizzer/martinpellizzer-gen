    "intro": "Crataegus foetida, commonly known as the foul-smelling hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red to orange berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family and is known for its ornamental value despite its pungent odor."
