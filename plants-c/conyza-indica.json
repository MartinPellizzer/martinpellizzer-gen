    "intro": "Conyza indica, commonly known as goatweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows up to 1 meter tall, with hairy stems and lobed leaves. Its small yellow flowers are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its invasive potential in some areas. Conyza indica is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
