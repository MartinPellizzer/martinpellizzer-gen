    "intro": "Carex ericetorum var. approximata, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial sedge native to the acidic, damp habitats of northern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green with a purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers in early summer. It is often found in heathlands, bogs, and along the edges of lakes and ponds. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration and garden planting in moist soils."
