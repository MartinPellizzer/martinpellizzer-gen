    "intro": "Cyathea veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its structural support, while its fronds are used in traditional M\u0101ori crafts. Cyathea veitchii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
