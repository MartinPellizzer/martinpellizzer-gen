    "intro": "Crepis integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth bentgrass, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and smooth, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the summer. Crepis integrifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
