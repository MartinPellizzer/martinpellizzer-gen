It typically grows in wet, marshy areas and thrives in cold climates. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, including frost and poor soil. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
