    "intro": "Crataegus marcida, commonly known as the marsh hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist soils along stream banks, marshes, and other waterlogged areas. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with serrated edges, and it has a rugged, often sprawling growth habit. Crataegus marcida plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
