    "intro": "Cyperus rotundus var. pallidus, commonly known as purple flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like stems and narrow, pale green to silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on short, lateral branches. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, along waterways, and in disturbed sites. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become a weed in agricultural and aquatic environments."
