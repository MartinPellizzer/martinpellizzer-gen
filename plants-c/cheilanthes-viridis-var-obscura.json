    "intro": "Cheilanthes viridis var. obscura, commonly known as the dark green rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is distinguished from the typical *Cheilanthes viridis* by its darker coloration and slightly different frond morphology."
