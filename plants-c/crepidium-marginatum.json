    "intro": "Crepidium marginatum, commonly known as the Margined Pteridium, is a rare and delicate fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, linear fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
