    "intro": "Chenopodium pratericola var. leptophylloides, commonly known as the slender-leafed goosefoot, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, and it produces small, smooth seeds. This species is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
