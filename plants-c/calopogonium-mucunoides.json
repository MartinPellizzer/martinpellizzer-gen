    "intro": "Calopogonium mucunoides, commonly known as the hairy urd or velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and its erect, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers followed by pod fruits containing several elliptical seeds. It is well-known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. This makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and sustainable agriculture."
