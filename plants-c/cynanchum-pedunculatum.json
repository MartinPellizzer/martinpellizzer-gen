    "intro": "Cynanchum pedunculatum, commonly known as the milkweed vine, is a perennial climbing plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes other milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap, which can be toxic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color, and it has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Cynanchum pedunculatum plays a role in supporting local insect populations, particularly as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
