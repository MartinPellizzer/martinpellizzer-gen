    "intro": "Cyperus contractus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, often forming dense stands. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually wind-pollinated, and its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively. Cyperus contractus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
