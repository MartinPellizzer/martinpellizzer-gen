    "intro": "Carex sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian sedge, is a perennial plant native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as stream banks and moist forests. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the sedge family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
