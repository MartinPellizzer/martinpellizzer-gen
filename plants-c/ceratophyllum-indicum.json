    "intro": "Ceratophyllum indicum, commonly known as the spiked watermilfoil, is a freshwater plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth and branching stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds and lakes. Its flowers are tiny and clustered, producing small, green fruits that float on the water surface. Ceratophyllum indicum is known for its ability to provide habitat for aquatic life and can sometimes become invasive in non-native environments."
