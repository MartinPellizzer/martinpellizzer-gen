    "intro": "Cerinthodes maritimum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found growing on rocky shores or sandy beaches. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against salt spray. Cerinthodes maritimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils."
