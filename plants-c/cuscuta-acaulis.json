    "intro": "Cuscuta acaulis, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to various regions of the world, including North America, and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating on the surface of the soil and then attaching to a host plant through specialized sucking structures called haustoria. Cuscuta acaulis is an annual plant that completes its life cycle within a single growing season."
