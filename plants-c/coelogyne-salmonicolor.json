    "intro": "Coelogyne salmonicolor, commonly known as the salmon-colored orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers with a distinctive salmon-pink hue, which bloom during the dry season. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered with a thick, leathery epidermis that helps store water. The orchid's foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs."
