    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 oberrodensis, commonly known as the Oberrod sedge, is a hybrid plant in the Carex genus, characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. It is native to Europe and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue when young. Carex \u00d7 oberrodensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
