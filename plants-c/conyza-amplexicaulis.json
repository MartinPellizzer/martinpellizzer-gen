It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that often encircle the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in composite inflorescences, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Conyza amplexicaulis is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through wind-dispersed seeds."
