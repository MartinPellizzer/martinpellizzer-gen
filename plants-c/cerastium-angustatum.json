    "intro": "Cerastium angustatum, commonly known as narrowleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks. It produces small, rounded fruits called capsules, which release tiny seeds when mature. Cerastium angustatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
