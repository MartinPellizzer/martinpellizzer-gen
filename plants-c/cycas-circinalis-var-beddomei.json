    "intro": "Cycas circinalis var. beddomei, commonly known as the Beddome's cycas, is a rare cycad species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, pinnate leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces small, spherical cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It is a slow-growing, long-lived species that thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is classified as critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
