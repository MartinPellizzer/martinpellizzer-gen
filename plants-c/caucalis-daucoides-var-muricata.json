    "intro": "Caucalis daucoides var. muricata, commonly known as the rough hedge bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated margins, and the plant produces small, round fruits that are covered in a rough, prickly texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
