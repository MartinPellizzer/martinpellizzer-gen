    "intro": "Cerastium ligusticum f. platyphyllum, commonly known as the flat-leaved mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are broader than the typical form of the species. The flowers are pinkish-white, with five petals, and appear in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This variety is noted for its compact foliage and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady areas."
