    "intro": "Conyza salsoloides, commonly known as sandmat, is an annual herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant has alternate leaves that are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that allow it to spread easily in open environments. Conyza salsoloides is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry conditions."
