    "intro": "Ceratozamia mexicana var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and specific habitat requirements make it a conservation concern. The varietal name 'longifolia' refers to its elongated, lance-shaped leaves."
