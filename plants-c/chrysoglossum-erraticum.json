It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in areas with high altitude and cool climates. Its flowers, which range from yellow to orange, are arranged in dense clusters and bloom during the spring season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its natural environment."
