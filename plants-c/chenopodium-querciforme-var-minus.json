    "intro": "Chenopodium querciforme var. minus, commonly known as little goosefoot, is a short-lived annual plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant has prostrate or ascending stems with small, rounded leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in diameter. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is valued for its ability to thrive in harsh environments and is sometimes used in restoration ecology."
