    "intro": "Chlorophytum inopinum, commonly known as the snake plant or mother-in-law's tongue, is a perennial evergreen plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, upright leaves that are typically variegated with green and white or yellow markings. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers on slender stalks, though it is more valued for its foliage than its blooms. Chlorophytum inopinum is also noted for its air-purifying qualities, contributing to improved indoor air quality."
