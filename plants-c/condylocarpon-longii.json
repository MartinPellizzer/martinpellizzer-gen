    "intro": "Condylocarpon longii, commonly known as the longii lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Caloplacaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on rock surfaces or bark in temperate regions. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is used as an indicator species for air quality."
