    "intro": "Cordia crenatifolia, commonly known as the balsa tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. The tree is notable for its lightweight, porous wood, which has been historically used for model-making and other lightweight applications."
