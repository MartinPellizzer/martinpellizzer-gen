It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking red-orange bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its roots to parasitize the roots of neighboring plants, drawing nutrients from them. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, adding vibrant color to the landscape."
