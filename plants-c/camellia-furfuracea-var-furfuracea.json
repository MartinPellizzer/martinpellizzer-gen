    "intro": "Camellia furfuracea var. furfuracea, commonly known as the silky camellia, is a species native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy, camellia-like flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It is an evergreen shrub that thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. The silky texture of its leaves and the ornamental value of its flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
