    "intro": "Ctenopteris corticola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rock surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Ctenopteris corticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
