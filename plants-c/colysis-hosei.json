    "intro": "Colysis hosei, commonly known as the Hawaiian moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hawaii. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves and produces small, round berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
