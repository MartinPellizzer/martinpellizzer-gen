    "intro": "Cheilanthes yatskievychiana, commonly known as the Yatskievych's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial, epiphytic, or lithophytic plant, often found growing on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with dense, clustered fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant is adapted to survive in arid or semi-arid conditions. Cheilanthes yatskievychiana is native to regions of Central America and is noted for its resilience and unique morphology."
