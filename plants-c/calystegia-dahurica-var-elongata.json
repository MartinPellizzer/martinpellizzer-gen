    "intro": "Calystegia dahurica var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed bindweed, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces trumpet-shaped, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a strong, persistent root system and can become invasive in certain environments. Its stems are hairy and capable of twining around supports, allowing it to climb and spread rapidly. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and forest edges."
