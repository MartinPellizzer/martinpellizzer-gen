    "intro": "Cenchrus complanatus, commonly known as flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its flat, wide leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, and its seeds are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
