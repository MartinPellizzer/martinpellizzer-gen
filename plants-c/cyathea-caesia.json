    "intro": "Cyathea caesia, commonly known as the silver tree or queen's tears, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a distinctive silvery appearance due to the fine, silky hairs covering its fronds. Cyathea caesia is a slow-growing plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-draining soil. It plays an important ecological role in tropical forests as a habitat and food source for various organisms."
