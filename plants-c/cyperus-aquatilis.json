    "intro": "Cyperus aquatilis, commonly known as the water flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Cyperus aquatilis is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, with a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in muddy substrates. It plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
