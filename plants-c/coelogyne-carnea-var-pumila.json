    "intro": "Coelogyne carnea var. pumila, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb that supports its foliage and flowers. The plant produces dense clusters of pink or reddish-purple flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming a rosette around the pseudobulb. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate under proper conditions."
