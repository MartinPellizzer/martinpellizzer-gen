    "intro": "Cyrtopera callichroma, commonly known as the golden-backed treehopper, is a species of treehopper native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated body shape and striking golden-colored exoskeleton. The plant it inhabits, typically a variety of shrubs and trees, provides both shelter and a source of nutrients for the insect. Its life cycle involves laying eggs on host plants, where the nymphs develop through several instars before reaching adulthood. The botanical interactions of Cyrtopera callichroma are essential for its survival and contribute to the ecological balance of its habitat."
