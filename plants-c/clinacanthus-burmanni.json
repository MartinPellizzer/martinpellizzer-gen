    "intro": "Clinacanthus burmanni, commonly known as the Burmann's ghost fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has slender, wiry rhizomes and produces delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, almost ghostly appearance. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a unique, linear pattern. Clinacanthus burmanni is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
