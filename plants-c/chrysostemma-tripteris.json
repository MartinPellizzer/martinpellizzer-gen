    "intro": "Chrysostemma tripteris, commonly known as the golden cupplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features a thick, branching stem with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowering heads are surrounded by a series of bracts that give it a cup-like appearance, hence its common name. Chrysostemma tripteris is often found in rocky soils and arid environments, thriving in full sun."
