    "intro": "Ceramium, commonly known as a type of red algae, is a genus of marine algae belonging to the order Ceramiales. These plants are typically found in shallow coastal waters, where they attach themselves to rocks or other substrates. Ceramium species are characterized by their branching, filamentous structure and their ability to produce a variety of secondary metabolites. They play an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms. Their vibrant red or orange coloration is due to the presence of pigments such as phycoerythrin."
