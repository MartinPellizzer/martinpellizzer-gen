    "intro": "Carissa papuana, commonly known as the Papuan moonvine, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands, including Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. It is a woody shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with thick, often spiny branches. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, while its roots are deep and fibrous, adapting to the island's tropical climate. Carissa papuana is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight."
