    "intro": "Colletia spinosa var. valdiviana, commonly known as the Valdivian cactus, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual element to its habitat. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation in succulent species. This variety is often found in coastal dunes and rocky soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing the landscape."
