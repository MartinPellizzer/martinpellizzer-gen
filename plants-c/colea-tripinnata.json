    "intro": "Colea tripinnata, commonly known as the three-parted corymbiferous plant, is a member of the Rubiaceae family. It is a shrub characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into three parts, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in corymbs, which are flat-topped clusters. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
