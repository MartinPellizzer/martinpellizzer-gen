    "intro": "Carex curvula f. pallida, commonly known as the pale carex, is a variant of the species Carex curvula, characterized by its pale green foliage. It is a perennial sedge that typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually green to brown in color. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curved at the tips, giving it a distinctive appearance. This subspecies is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
