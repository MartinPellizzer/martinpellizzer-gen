It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
