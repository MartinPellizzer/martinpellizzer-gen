    "intro": "Creochiton brevibracteata, commonly known as the short-bracted flatback slug, is a species of land flatback slug native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aegididae and is characterized by its small, elongated body and a distinctive, short bract-like structure on its posterior end. The slug's body is typically covered in a smooth, moist skin that aids in its movement through humid environments. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as under leaf litter or in forest floors, where it feeds on decaying plant matter. This species plays a role in nutrient cycling by breaking down organic material in its ecosystem."
