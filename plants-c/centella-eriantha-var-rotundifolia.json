    "intro": "Centella eriantha var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the rounded leaf centella, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported skin-healing properties."
