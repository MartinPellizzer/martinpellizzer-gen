    "intro": "Centranthus lecoqii subsp. maroccanus, commonly known as the Moroccan redflower, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Morocco. It is characterized by its vibrant red tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems, giving it a compact, bushy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
