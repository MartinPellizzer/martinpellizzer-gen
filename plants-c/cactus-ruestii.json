    "intro": "Cactus ruestii, commonly known as the desert rose, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a thick, branching stem covered in short, spiny areoles, which are characteristic of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, often blooming in the evening. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stem to survive in dry conditions. Cactus ruestii is well adapted to hot, sunny environments and requires minimal water once established."
