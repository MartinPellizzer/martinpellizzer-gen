It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a rounded base and a pointed tip, often slightly hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
