    "intro": "Colymbada persica, commonly known as Persian water lily, is a water plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves and showy white or pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The flowers are typically fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
