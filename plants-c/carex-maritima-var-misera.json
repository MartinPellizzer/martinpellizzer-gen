    "intro": "Carex maritima var. misera, commonly known as the sea sedge, is a variant of the sea sedge species native to coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers. This plant thrives in moist, saline environments such as salt marshes and tidal flats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in coastal habitats. The plant's ability to tolerate salt and waterlogged conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
