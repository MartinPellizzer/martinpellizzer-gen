    "intro": "Cyathea tricolor, commonly known as the three-colored tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that display a striking tricolor pattern of green, brown, and white. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, making it a striking feature in tropical gardens. Cyathea tricolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for with proper moisture and light conditions."
