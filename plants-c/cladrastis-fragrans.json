    "intro": "Cladrastis fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant crossvine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces showy, pendulous flowers in shades of white to pink, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Cladrastis fragrans is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade. It prefers well-drained soil and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
