    "intro": "Cynara humilis var. lacinulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved artichoke, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal rosettes of silver-gray, lance-shaped leaves with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces a spiky, thistle-like flower head that transitions from green to purple as it matures. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological value. While not as commonly cultivated as the edible artichoke, it is appreciated for its ornamental qualities and resilience in arid conditions."
