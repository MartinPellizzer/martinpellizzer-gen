    "intro": "Clonodia sessilis, commonly known as the sessile clonodia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial shade. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are clustered in spikes and are usually pink to red in color, blooming in the summer months. Clonodia sessilis is notable for its ability to form clonal colonies, which helps it spread and establish in suitable habitats."
