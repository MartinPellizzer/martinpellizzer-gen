    "intro": "Collomia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf collomia, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae, which is characterized by its hairy stems and blue or purple flowers. The plant typically reaches heights of only a few inches, with small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
