    "intro": "Coronilla comosa, commonly known as the hairy crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is capable of fixing nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and erosion control. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
