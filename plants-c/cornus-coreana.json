    "intro": "Cornus coreana, commonly known as the Korean dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its showy, white bracts that appear in late spring, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its fruit is a dark red, fleshy drupe that ripens in late summer. Cornus coreana thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
