    "intro": "Cornus esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli's dogwood, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows at high elevations, often in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are simple, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cornus esquirolii is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
