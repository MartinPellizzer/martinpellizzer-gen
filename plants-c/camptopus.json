    "intro": "Camptopus, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Camptopus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
