    "intro": "Cotoneaster reflexus, commonly known as the reflexed cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Cotoneaster reflexus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
