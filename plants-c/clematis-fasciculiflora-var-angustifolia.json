It features slender, twining stems that can grow up to 15 feet in length, supporting its vigorous growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are compound, with elongated, narrow leaflets that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions."
