    "intro": "Coleus glandulosus, commonly known as the sticky coleus, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in spikes at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Coleus glandulosus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
