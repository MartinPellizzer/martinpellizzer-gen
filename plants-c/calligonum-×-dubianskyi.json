    "intro": "Calligonum \u00d7 dubianskyi, commonly known as the hybrid saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a natural hybrid between Calligonum leucocarpum and Calligonum elongatum, exhibiting traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its dense, low-growing form and grayish-green foliage, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, edible berries. Calligonum \u00d7 dubianskyi is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in saline soils."
