    "intro": "Chileniopsis, commonly known as the Chilean orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the arid regions of Chile, particularly the Atacama Desert, where it has adapted to extreme environmental conditions. The plants typically have small, delicate flowers that are often pale or greenish in color, which helps them blend into their harsh surroundings. Chileniopsis species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they rely on humid air for moisture. Due to their unique adaptations and limited distribution, many species are considered rare or endangered."
