    "intro": "Caroxylon iljinii, commonly known as the Iljin's carob tree, is a rare and ancient plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its woody, branching structure and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, though it is less commonly cultivated than other carob species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Caroxylon iljinii is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
