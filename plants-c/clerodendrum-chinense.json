It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in summer. These flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees and butterflies. The plant is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
