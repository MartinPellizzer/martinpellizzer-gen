    "intro": "Cordia greggii, commonly known as Gregg's cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by spherical, cotton-like seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Cordia greggii is well adapted to drought conditions and is a common species in desert ecosystems."
