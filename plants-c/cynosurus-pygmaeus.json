    "intro": "Cynosurus pygmaeus, commonly known as the pygmy fescue, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is a perennial species, capable of surviving in a variety of soil conditions, though it prefers well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
