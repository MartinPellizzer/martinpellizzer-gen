    "intro": "Cinnamomum glaucescens, commonly known as the Chinese cinnamon or Guangxi cinnamon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lanceolate, dark green leaves that have a slightly waxy texture and emit a subtle aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval, reddish-brown berries containing a single seed. Its bark, which is thin and light-colored, is used in traditional medicine and as a spice, though it is less commonly used than true cinnamon. The plant thrives in humid, subtropical climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil."
