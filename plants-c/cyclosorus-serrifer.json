    "intro": "Cyclosorus serrifer, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, each with serrated edges. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged. Cyclosorus serrifer plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through its filtration capabilities."
