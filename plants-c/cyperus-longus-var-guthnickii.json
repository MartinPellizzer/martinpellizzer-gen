It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features include narrow, linear leaves and small, three-lobed flowers arranged in dense clusters. Cyperus longus var. guthnickii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
