    "intro": "Chiococca brachiata var. intercedens, commonly known as the red-veined chiococca, is a climbing shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb or trail along supports. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded garden settings."
