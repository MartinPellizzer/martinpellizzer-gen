    "intro": "Coffea sessilis, commonly known as the sessile coffee. It is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical Africa, characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries containing two seeds, which are used to make coffee. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less commercially cultivated species compared to other coffee plants."
