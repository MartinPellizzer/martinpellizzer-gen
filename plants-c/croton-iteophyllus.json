    "intro": "Croton iteophyllus, commonly known as the silver croton, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that display a mix of green, white, and yellow hues. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens with appropriate care."
