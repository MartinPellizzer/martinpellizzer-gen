    "intro": "Cynometra marleneae, commonly known as the Malawi ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the eastern African region, including Tanzania, Kenya, and Malawi. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are followed by round, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and timber use, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
