    "intro": "Claytonia multicaulis, commonly known as the mountain sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially under stress or in full sun. The plant produces small, white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a tight, spherical inflorescence. Its leaves are edible and have a slightly tart, lemony flavor, making it a popular forager's herb. Claytonia multicaulis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks."
