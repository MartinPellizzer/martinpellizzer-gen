    "intro": "Camelina microcarpa var. brevistyla, commonly known as the short-styled camelina, is a herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important oilseed crops. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compact growth habit. Its leaves are alternate and linear, with a rough texture, and it produces small, round seeds. This variety is of interest for its potential in ecological restoration and as a model for studying plant adaptation to arid environments."
