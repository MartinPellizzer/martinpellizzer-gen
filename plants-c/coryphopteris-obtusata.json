It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its leathery, broad leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and help anchor it in soil while absorbing nutrients. Coryphopteris obtusata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
