    "intro": "Coluteastrum flexuosum, commonly known as the creeping colutea, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly hairy texture. Coluteastrum flexuosum is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to thrive in sunny, well-drained environments."
