    "intro": "Critonia lanicaulis, commonly known as the woolly lichen, is a type of lichen that exhibits unique botanical features. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly coating of fungal hyphae and algal cells. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to thrive on rocky surfaces in arid environments. Its structure consists of a thallus that is typically pale to yellowish in color. Critonia lanicaulis is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution."
