    "intro": "Cerastium afromontanum var. keniense, commonly known as Kenyan mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Kenya. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It typically grows in rocky or grassy areas at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
