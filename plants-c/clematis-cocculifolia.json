It features compound leaves with three to five ovate leaflets and produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows along stream banks and in moist woodlands, preferring partial to full shade. Its flowers are usually blue or violet, with a distinctive spurred structure at the base of the petals. Clematis cocculifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
