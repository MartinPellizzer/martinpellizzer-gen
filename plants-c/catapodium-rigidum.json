    "intro": "Catapodium rigidum, commonly known as the rigid catapodium, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features erect, stiff stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a fibrous texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough, hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Catapodium rigidum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments."
