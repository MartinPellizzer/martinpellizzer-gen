    "intro": "Cactus urumbeba, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cactus, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, nocturnal flowers that open at night, attracting pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. The cactus also has a deep root system that helps it access underground water sources."
