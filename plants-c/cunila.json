    "intro": "Cunila, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like flower clusters. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often used in culinary applications for their mild, anise-like flavor. The plant produces small white or greenish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cunila thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its growth habit is typically herbaceous, with some species exhibiting biennial or perennial life cycles."
