    "intro": "Craibiodendron scleranthum var. scleranthum, commonly known as the rock heath, is a shrub native to the rocky and arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and showy, pinkish-red flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access moisture. Its flowers bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
