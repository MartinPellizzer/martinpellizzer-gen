    "intro": "Cystopteris polymorpha, commonly known as the variable water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments called pinnae. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Cystopteris polymorpha is often found in temperate regions and is known for its ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions."
