    "intro": "Chondrilla piptocoma, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in disturbed or dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Chondrilla piptocoma is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
