    "intro": "Chenopodium sericeum, commonly known as silver goosefoot, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape and have a distinctive silvery sheen due to the dense covering of fine hairs. Chenopodium sericeum is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments."
