    "intro": "Capparis arborea, commonly known as the tree caper, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Indian subcontinent. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, red or purple berries. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to arid conditions. Capparis arborea is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
