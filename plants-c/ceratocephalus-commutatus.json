    "intro": "Ceratocephalus commutatus, commonly known as the common burrweed, is an annual flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, prickly stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive burrs that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
