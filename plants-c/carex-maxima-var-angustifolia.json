    "intro": "Carex maxima var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy, growing in dense clumps. The plant produces spikes of small, usually brown or greenish flowers in the summer, which are clustered in a terminal spike. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
