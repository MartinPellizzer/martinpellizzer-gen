It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
