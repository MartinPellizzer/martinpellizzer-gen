    "intro": "Czekelia, commonly known as the red hellebore, is a striking perennial plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and showy, red or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a cluster of small, yellow stamens surrounded by petal-like sepals, giving it a distinctive appearance. Czekelia is known for its toxic properties, containing compounds such as protoanemonin, which can be harmful if ingested. It thrives in woodland areas and prefers moist, well-drained soil."
