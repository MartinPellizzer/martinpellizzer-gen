    "intro": "Cinnamomum contractum, commonly known as Malabar cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark purple berries. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial shade. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to cinnamon. However, it is less commercially significant than Cinnamomum verum."
