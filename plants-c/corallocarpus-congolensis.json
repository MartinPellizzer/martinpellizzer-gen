    "intro": "Corallocarpus congolensis, commonly known as the Congo corallocarpus, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit and small, clustered flowers that are often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth surface, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are not well-documented in terms of their ecological role. Due to habitat loss and limited research, little is known about its reproductive biology and conservation status."
