It is characterized by its narrow, sickle-shaped leaves and erect, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its nutritional value. The variety truncata is distinguished by its truncated leaf tips, giving it a unique appearance compared to other canavalia species."
