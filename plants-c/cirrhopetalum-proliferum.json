    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum proliferum, commonly known as the hairy petal orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy petals that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with a delicate appearance that contrasts with its robust, hairy foliage. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
