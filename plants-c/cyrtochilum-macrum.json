    "intro": "Cyrtochilum macrum, commonly known as the Macrum orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces compact, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Cyrtochilum macrum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral structure."
