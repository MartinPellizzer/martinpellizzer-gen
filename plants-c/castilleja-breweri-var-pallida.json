    "intro": "Castilleja breweri var. pallida, commonly known as the pallid milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a slender, branching stem and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants, contributing to its survival in nutrient-poor environments."
