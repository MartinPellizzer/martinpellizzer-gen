    "intro": "Centaurea americana, commonly known as American knapweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils. The plant features upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow to red flowers in composite inflorescences. Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological balance. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
