    "intro": "Carlina frigida subsp. renatae, commonly known as the alpine cudweed, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cold, dry conditions. The plant has basal leaves that are often covered in dense, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, high-altitude soils."
