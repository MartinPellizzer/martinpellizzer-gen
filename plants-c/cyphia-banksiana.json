    "intro": "Cyphia banksiana, commonly known as the Banks' cyphia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Cyphia banksiana is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for native pollinators."
