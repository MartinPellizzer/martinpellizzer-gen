    "intro": "Ctenodon viscidulus, commonly known as the sticky ctenodon, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its unique, sticky secretions on its leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests or under dense canopy cover. Its leaves are often broad and glossy, with a waxy texture that aids in water retention. The flowers are small and clustered, usually greenish-white in color, and are pollinated by insects."
