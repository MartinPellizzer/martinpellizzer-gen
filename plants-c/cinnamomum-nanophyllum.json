It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. This plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and fragrant, aromatic bark that is used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The tree typically grows to a height of about 10 meters and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by oval-shaped fruits. Its botanical features make it distinct from other cinnamon species, with a unique combination of leaf morphology and aromatic properties."
