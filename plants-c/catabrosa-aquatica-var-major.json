It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant features long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to help stabilize aquatic ecosystems."
