    "intro": "Chaptalia exscapa var. microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf chaptalia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It features compact, hairy stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense inflorescences, and bloom during the summer months. This variant is characterized by its reduced flower heads compared to the typical species, giving it a more delicate appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or grassy alpine habitats."
