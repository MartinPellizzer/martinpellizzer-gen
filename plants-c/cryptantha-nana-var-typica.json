It typically reaches a height of less than 10 centimeters and produces small, blue to purple flowers in clusters. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas."
