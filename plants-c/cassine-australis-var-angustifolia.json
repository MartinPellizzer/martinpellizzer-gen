    "intro": "Cassine australis var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf paperbark, is a variant of the paperbark tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, fibrous capsules that contain its seeds. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing in open woodlands or heathlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
