    "intro": "Cephalophyllum comptonii, commonly known as the Compton's headplant, is a rare and unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, cushion-like growth habit and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise compact form. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized collections."
