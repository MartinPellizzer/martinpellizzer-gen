    "intro": "Cucumis cogniauxianus, commonly known as the Cogniaux cucumber, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Cucurbitaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, elongated fruits that are typically green and have a mild, cucumber-like flavor. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with a distinctive, lobed shape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
