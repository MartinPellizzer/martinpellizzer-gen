    "intro": "Cochlidium connellii, commonly known as the Connell's marsh snail, is a small aquatic gastropod mollusk native to the western United States. It is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The snail has a spiral, shell-like structure that provides protection from predators and environmental stressors. Its diet primarily consists of algae and detritus, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to habitat loss and pollution, Cochlidium connellii is considered a species of conservation concern."
