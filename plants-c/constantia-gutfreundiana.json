    "intro": "Constantia gutfreundiana, commonly known as the Gutfreund's constantia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun exposure. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
