    "intro": "Clerodendrum pleiosciadium, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a flowering shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its showy, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, clustered within the bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
