    "intro": "Crataegus antheina, commonly known as the white thornapple, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits known as pomes, which are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and hedgerows. Crataegus antheina is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
