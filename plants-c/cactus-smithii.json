    "intro": "Cactus smithii, commonly known as the Smith's cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its ribbed stems and sparse, spiny foliage. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in rocky or sandy soils within desert ecosystems."
