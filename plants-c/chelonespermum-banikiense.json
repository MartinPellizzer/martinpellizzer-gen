    "intro": "Chelonespermum banikiense, commonly known as the Banikiensis Moonflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed species, and is characterized by its striking, night-blooming flowers. The plant produces large, white, trumpet-shaped blooms that emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
