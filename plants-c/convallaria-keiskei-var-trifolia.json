    "intro": "Convallaria keiskei var. trifolia, commonly known as the trifoliate lily of the valley, is a rare variant of the lily of the valley species. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Japan, characterized by its clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three parts, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies."
