    "intro": "Chamaeplium officinale, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its astringent properties. Chamaeplium officinale thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is commonly found in forested areas and rocky habitats."
