    "intro": "Cyperus nyikanus, commonly known as the African flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, three-lobed leaves and spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Cyperus nyikanus is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its adaptability to waterlogged soils makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
