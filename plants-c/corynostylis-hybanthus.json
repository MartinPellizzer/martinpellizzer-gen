    "intro": "Corynostylis hybanthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved corynostylis, is a member of the family Orchidaceae, native to Australia. It is a terrestrial herb with slender, often hairy stems and small, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming during late spring to early summer. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils in woodland or heathland environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
