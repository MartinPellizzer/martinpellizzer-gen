    "intro": "Cactus rubidulus, commonly known as the red prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Cactus rubidulus plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
