    "intro": "Colysis dilatatum, commonly known as the broadleaf colysis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early to mid-summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. Colysis dilatatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
