    "intro": "Chaetanthera linearis var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered moonflower, is a perennial climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, wiry stems that twine around supports and bear opposite, linear leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy, white, funnel-shaped flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its blooming period typically occurs in late summer to early autumn, and the flowers close by morning. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
