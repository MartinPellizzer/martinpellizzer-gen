It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a slightly toothed margin. Cotoneaster hissaricus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive form and seasonal color changes."
