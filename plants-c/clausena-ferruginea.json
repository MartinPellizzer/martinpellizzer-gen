    "intro": "Clausena ferruginea, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often pubescent underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by orange to red, fleshy berries. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, though it is also used in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks."
