    "intro": "Cardamine lucorum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water-crowfoot, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp, shaded areas such as stream sides and wet meadows. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that form a rosette near the water's surface. Its flowers are small, white or pale green, and arranged in a cluster at the tip of the stem. Cardamine lucorum plays a role in supporting aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
