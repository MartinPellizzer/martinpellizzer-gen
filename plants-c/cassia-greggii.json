    "intro": "Cassia greggii, commonly known as the desert cassia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring deep taproots and waxy leaves to reduce water loss. It produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cassia greggii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
