    "intro": "Cynosurus coeruleus, commonly known as blue grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its slender, erect stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Cynosurus coeruleus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
