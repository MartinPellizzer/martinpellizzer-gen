    "intro": "Calamus asperrimus, commonly known as the rough calamus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acoraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender rhizomes that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant features long, narrow leaves with a rough, textured surface, which contributes to its common name. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Calamus asperrimus is valued for its aromatic rhizomes, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
