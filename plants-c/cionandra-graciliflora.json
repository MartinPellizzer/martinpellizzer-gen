    "intro": "Cionandra graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered cionandra, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, with opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Cionandra graciliflora is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
