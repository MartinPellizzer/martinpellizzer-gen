    "intro": "Cyperus tacnensis var. tarijensis, commonly known as the Tarijensis flatsedge, is a grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly in regions of Bolivia and Peru. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to saturated soil conditions. It has slender, grass-like stems with small, triangular leaves and produces spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. This variant is distinguished by its geographic distribution and habitat preferences, making it an important species in the study of wetland flora."
