    "intro": "Cymbia, commonly known as the cymbidium orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their long, narrow leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom in winter or early spring. Cymbia species are native to Asia, particularly China, Japan, and the Himalayas, where they thrive in cool, moist environments. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are relatively easy to care for in a home setting. The flowers typically come in shades of red, pink, white, and yellow, making them a popular choice for gardeners and florists alike."
