    "intro": "Castilleja tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features showy, red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense, white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. Castilleja tomentosa is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe."
