    "intro": "Cystopteris filix-fragilis subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine water fern, is a fern species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bi-lobed and have a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous regions where temperatures are cool and humidity is high."
