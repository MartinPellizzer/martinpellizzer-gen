    "intro": "Callitriche dacryoidea, commonly known as the weeping water-starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in length. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and arranged in clusters, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Callitriche dacryoidea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
