    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus subsp. latisquameus, commonly known as the broad-scale goldenbush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and dense, aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and plains. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader scales on the stem compared to other forms of the species."
