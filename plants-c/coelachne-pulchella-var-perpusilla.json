It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, white to pale blue florets that are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
