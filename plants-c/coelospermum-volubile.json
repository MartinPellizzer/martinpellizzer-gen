    "intro": "Coelospermum volubile, commonly known as the climbing cypress, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a woody vine characterized by its slender, twisting stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. Coelospermum volubile is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and ability to climb structures."
