    "intro": "Carex austrokoreensis, commonly known as the Korean sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-pollinated flowers, and it often forms dense clumps through rhizome growth. Carex austrokoreensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wet habitats."
