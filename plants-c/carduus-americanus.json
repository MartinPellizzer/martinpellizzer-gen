    "intro": "Carduus americanus, commonly known as the American thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can form dense stands, often becoming invasive in certain regions. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a distinctive heart-shaped base. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
