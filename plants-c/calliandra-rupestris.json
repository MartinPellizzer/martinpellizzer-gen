    "intro": "Calliandra rupestris, commonly known as the rock calliandra, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and clusters of bright red or orange pea-like flowers. The plant has bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, feather-like segments, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its showy blooms and drought tolerance. Calliandra rupestris is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
