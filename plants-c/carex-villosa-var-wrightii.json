    "intro": "Carex villosa var. wrightii, commonly known as Wright's hairy sedge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with soft, hairy textures on the leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas or along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
