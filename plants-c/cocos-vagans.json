    "intro": "Cocos vagans, commonly known as the wandering coconut, is a unique plant belonging to the Arecaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into three-lobed fruits, each containing a single seed. Native to tropical regions, it thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires ample sunlight. Despite its name, it is not a true coconut but a close relative with similar ecological adaptations."
