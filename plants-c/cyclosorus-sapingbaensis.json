    "intro": "Cyclosorus sapingbaensis, commonly known as the Sapingba moss, is a rare species of liverwort belonging to the family Peltasporaceae. It is characterized by its intricate thallus structure, which is typically green or yellowish in color and covered with a thin layer of rhizoids. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on decaying wood. Its reproductive structures, called gemmae, are produced in clusters and aid in its propagation. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
