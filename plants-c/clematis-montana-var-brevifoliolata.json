It features small, palmately lobed leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in diameter. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, fertile soil. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in garden landscapes for its delicate beauty and ease of cultivation."
