    "intro": "Caladenia ancylosa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. The plant produces a single, slender stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf and a small, greenish-white flower with a distinctive spur. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its specialized pollination mechanism involving native bees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
