    "intro": "Crocus sanandajensis, commonly known as the Sanandaj crocus, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of western Iran. This bulbous plant belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, early spring blooming period. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, often with a purple or violet tinge. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
