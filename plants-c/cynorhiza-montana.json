    "intro": "Cynorhiza montana, commonly known as the mountain cynorhiza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a distinctive root system that forms a dense, fibrous network, which helps it anchor firmly in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, providing some protection against harsh environmental conditions. Cynorhiza montana is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained soils."
