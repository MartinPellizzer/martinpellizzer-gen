    "intro": "Clavinodum oedogonatum, commonly known as the spike moss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its spore-bearing cones and a simple, branching structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are small and scale-like, and it lacks true roots, instead having root-like structures called rhizoids. Clavinodum oedogonatum plays an important role in ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
