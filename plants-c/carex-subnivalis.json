    "intro": "Carex subnivalis, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. This species thrives in cold, moist environments such as alpine tundras and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, stabilizing soil in harsh conditions. Carex subnivalis is adapted to low light and nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient component of alpine ecosystems."
