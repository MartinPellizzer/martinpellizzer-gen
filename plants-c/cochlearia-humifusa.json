    "intro": "Cochlearia humifusa, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage close to the ground, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in a distinctive spiral pattern. Its flowers are borne on slender stems and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. Cochlearia humifusa is often found in moist, calcareous soils in grassy or rocky habitats."
