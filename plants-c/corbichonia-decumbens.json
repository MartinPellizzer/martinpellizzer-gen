    "intro": "Corbichonia decumbens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features sprawling, decumbent stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Corbichonia decumbens is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun conditions."
