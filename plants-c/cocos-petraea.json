    "intro": "Cocos petraea, commonly known as the rock coconut, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Canary Islands. It is a small, shrub-like plant that thrives in rocky, coastal environments. The plant produces small, round fruits that resemble coconuts, though they are not true coconuts. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand strong coastal winds and salt spray. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cocos petraea is considered a vulnerable species."
