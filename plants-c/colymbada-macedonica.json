    "intro": "Colymbada macedonica, commonly known as the Macedonian watercress, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of northern Greece. It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system helps stabilize sediment in shallow waters, contributing to water clarity. Due to habitat loss and pollution, Colymbada macedonica is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
