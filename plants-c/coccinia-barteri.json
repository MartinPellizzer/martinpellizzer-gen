    "intro": "Coccinia barteri, commonly known as the African leaf vine, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and gourds, and is characterized by its tendrils that aid in climbing. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by round, orange-red fruits that are edible when ripe. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a slightly pubescent surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Coccinia barteri is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in some African cultures."
