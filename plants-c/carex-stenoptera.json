    "intro": "Carex stenoptera, commonly known as narrow-leaved sedgewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of inconspicuous flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas. Carex stenoptera is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
