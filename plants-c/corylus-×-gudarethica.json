It is a natural hybrid between Corylus avellana (common hazel) and Corylus colurna (wingnut), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The species is notable for its large, edible nuts that mature in late summer to early autumn. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and features compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its potential as a nut-producing crop in suitable climates."
