    "intro": "Cucumeropsis mannii, commonly known as the African horned cucumber, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It produces large, spiny fruits that resemble cucumbers, with a distinctive horn-like protrusion at the tip. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist woodland areas. The fruit is edible when young but becomes seedy and less palatable as it matures."
