    "intro": "Cyclosorus \u00d7 nepalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan water fern, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is a member of the Marsileaceae family and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, and is adapted to tolerate varying water conditions. Its leaves are typically four-lobed and have a delicate, lace-like appearance, which aids in photosynthesis in aquatic settings. Cyclosorus \u00d7 nepalensis plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
