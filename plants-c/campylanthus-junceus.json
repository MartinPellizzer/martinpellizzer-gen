It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid environments. It produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Campylanthus junceus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
