    "intro": "Chaenostoma rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf water plantain, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Alismataceae family and typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and ponds. The plant has broad, rounded leaves that are often floating or submerged, and it produces small, white or pink flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in aquatic habitats. It plays an important role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
