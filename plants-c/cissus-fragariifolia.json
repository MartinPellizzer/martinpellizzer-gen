    "intro": "Cissus fragariifolia, commonly known as the grape ivy, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically light green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, grape-like berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its vigorous growth and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for hanging baskets and trellises."
