    "intro": "Croton erioanthemus, commonly known as the velvetleaf croton, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are typically a deep green with a soft texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its growth habit is shrub-like, with multiple stems arising from the base. Croton erioanthemus is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers."
