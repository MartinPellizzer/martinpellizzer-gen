It features small, delicate flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. The leaves are basal, forming a rosette and are usually heart-shaped with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces aquatic or semi-aquatic flowers that are often found in shallow water or moist soil. It is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
