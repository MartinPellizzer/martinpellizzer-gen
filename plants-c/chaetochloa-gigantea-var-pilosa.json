    "intro": "Chaetochloa gigantea var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features dense, tufted growth with long, slender leaves covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in wetland or marshy environments. This variety is distinguished by its hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps in identifying it from other similar grasses."
