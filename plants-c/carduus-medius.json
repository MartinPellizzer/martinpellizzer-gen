    "intro": "Carduus medius, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are covered in a layer of fine hairs and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, making it a composite plant with a complex floral structure."
