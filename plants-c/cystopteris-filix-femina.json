    "intro": "Cystopteris filix-femina, commonly known as the female fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Cystopteris filix-femina is a perennial plant that spreads through rhizomes, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
