    "intro": "Chlorospatha besseae, commonly known as the yellow spathate, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Araceae, which is characterized by its unique inflorescence structure known as a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant is noted for its bright yellow spathe, which serves as a visual attractant for pollinators. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Chlorospatha besseae is considered a conservation concern."
