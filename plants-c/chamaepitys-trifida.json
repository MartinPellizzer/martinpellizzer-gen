    "intro": "Chamaepitys trifida, commonly known as the three-leaf pine, is a rare and endangered coniferous species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its unique trifoliate leaves, which consist of three needle-like segments growing from a single stem. The plant typically grows in high-elevation environments, such as rocky slopes and mountainous regions, where it forms dense, shrub-like colonies. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Chamaepitys trifida faces significant conservation challenges."
