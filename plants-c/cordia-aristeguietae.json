    "intro": "Cordia aristeguietae, commonly known as the Bolivian white cedar, is a small evergreen tree native to the Andean regions of Bolivia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale gray bark and elliptical, glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellowish-orange fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
