    "intro": "Chamaesyce vulgaris subsp. massiliensis, commonly known as the Massilian sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping or as a ground cover in dry gardens."
