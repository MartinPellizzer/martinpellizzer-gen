    "intro": "Cyperus vaginatus var. contractus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a tight rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets at the base of the stems. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond margins, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
