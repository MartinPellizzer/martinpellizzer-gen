    "intro": "Cirsium coahuilense, commonly known as the Coahuila thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and large, showy purple or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Cirsium coahuilense plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is an important species in the ecological balance of its native range."
