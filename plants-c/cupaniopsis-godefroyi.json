    "intro": "Cupaniopsis godefroyi, commonly known as the Godefroy's cupaniopsis, is a shrub native to the arid regions of central Australia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Cupaniopsis godefroyi is often found in rocky outcrops and is valued for its resilience and ornamental potential in dryland gardens."
