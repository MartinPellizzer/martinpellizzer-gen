    "intro": "Corybas kaiganganianus, commonly known as the Kaigani ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the remote Kaigani Islands in the Torres Strait. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, urn-shaped flower that lacks petals, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant is epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellow, and it blooms infrequently, making it a challenging subject for study. Due to its restricted habitat and low population, it is considered critically endangered and is of significant botanical interest."
