    "intro": "Comarostaphylis, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaryllidaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Comarostaphylis species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
