It features slender, arching blades with a silvery-blue hue due to fine, hair-like structures on the leaves. The plant produces dense, panicle-like inflorescences that are often used in ornamental landscaping. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and water management projects."
