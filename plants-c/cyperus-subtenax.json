    "intro": "Cyperus subtenax, commonly known as slender flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its slender, erect stems are often covered with small, scale-like leaves, and it produces spikes of tiny, three-lobed flowers. Cyperus subtenax is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
