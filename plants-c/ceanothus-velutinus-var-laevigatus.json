    "intro": "Ceanothus velutinus var. laevigatus, commonly known as the smoothleaf ceanothus, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its soft, gray-green foliage and clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive velvety texture. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
