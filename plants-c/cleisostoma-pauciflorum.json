    "intro": "Cleisostoma pauciflorum, commonly known as the rare orchid of the genus Cleisostoma, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that produce pseudobulbs and leafy shoots. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Cleisostoma pauciflorum is often found in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction."
