    "intro": "Celmisia spectabilis subsp. spectabilis, commonly known as the showy celmisia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that consist of numerous small, tubular flowers clustered in dense, often colorful heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and covered in fine pubescence. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds."
