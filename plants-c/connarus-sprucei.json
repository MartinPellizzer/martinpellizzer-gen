It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are borne in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and timber quality, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
