    "intro": "Clomenocoma, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Clomenocoma is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
