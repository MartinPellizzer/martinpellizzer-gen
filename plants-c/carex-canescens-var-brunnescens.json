It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along stream banks.
