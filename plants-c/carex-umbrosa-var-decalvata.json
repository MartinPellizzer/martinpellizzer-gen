It features dense, cylindrical inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues, adding visual interest to woodland gardens. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires consistently moist soil conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for small insects and birds."
