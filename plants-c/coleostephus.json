These plants are characterized by their bell-shaped or tubular flowers, often with five lobes, and are typically found in temperate regions. Coleostephus species are perennial herbs that produce showy, often blue or purple blooms. They have opposite, lance-shaped leaves and are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value.
