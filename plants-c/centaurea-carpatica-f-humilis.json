    "intro": "Centaurea carpatica f. humilis, commonly known as the low centaury, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features slender, hairy stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value. This subspecies is distinguished by its shorter stature compared to the typical form of Centaurea carpatica."
