    "intro": "Chascolytrum bidentatum, commonly known as the two-toothed chascolytrum, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces oval, ribbed fruits that contain several seeds, and its leaves are typically pinnately divided. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range."
