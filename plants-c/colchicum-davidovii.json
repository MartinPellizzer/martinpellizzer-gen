    "intro": "Colchicum davidovii, commonly known as the David's colchicum, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant has a distinctive, short stem with a single, showy flower that sits above a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in harsh, arid environments, storing nutrients to support growth during periods of drought. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique flowering habit."
