    "intro": "Coursetia mollis, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, hairy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from underground water sources. Coursetia mollis is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
