    "intro": "Cinchona micrantha var. reicheliana, commonly known as the Reichel's quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its lanceolate, dark green leaves and showy, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its production of alkaloids, including quinine, which has historically been used in the treatment of malaria. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at moderate altitudes. Due to its medicinal value and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native range."
