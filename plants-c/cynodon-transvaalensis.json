    "intro": "Cynodon transvaalensis, commonly known as the Transvaal grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for use in lawns and erosion control. Cynodon transvaalensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf."
