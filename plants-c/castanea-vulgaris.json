    "intro": "Castanea vulgaris, commonly known as the common chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and palmately compound leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces spiny, cup-like fruits called burrs, each containing one or two edible nuts. The nuts are encased in a thick, fibrous husk that splits open when mature. Castanea vulgaris is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical significance in agriculture and cuisine."
