    "intro": "Crocodilodes harveyana, commonly known as the Harvey's crocodile orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated green leaves and its distinctive, intricate flower structure that resembles a crocodile's head, giving it its common name. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a vibrant purple and yellow coloration, which blooms during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires specific humidity and temperature conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
