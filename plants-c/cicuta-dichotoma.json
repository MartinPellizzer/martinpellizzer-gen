    "intro": "Cicuta dichotoma, commonly known as water hemlock, is a highly toxic member of the parsley family (Apiaceae). It is a biennial herb that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has a distinctive, hollow, ridged stem with a strong, unpleasant odor. Its leaves are finely divided and fern-like, while its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters. Due to its extreme toxicity, all parts of the plant are dangerous if ingested."
