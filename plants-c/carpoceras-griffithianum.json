    "intro": "Carpoceras griffithianum, commonly known as the Himalayan orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its small, intricately shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem and produces a single, upright inflorescence with several blooms. Its growth is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its mountainous habitat, and it requires specific soil and climate conditions to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
