    "intro": "Calceolaria espinosae, commonly known as the Espinosa's slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Calceolaria espinosae is typically found in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it grows in partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
