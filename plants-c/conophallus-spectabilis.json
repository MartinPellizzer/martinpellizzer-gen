    "intro": "Conophallus spectabilis, commonly known as the showy conophallus, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright red, often with contrasting white or yellow markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a velvety texture. Conophallus spectabilis is noted for its unique floral structure, which includes a prominent, spurred corona that aids in pollination by specific insects."
