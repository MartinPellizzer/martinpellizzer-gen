    "intro": "Clompanus simplex, commonly known as the simple clompan, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Clompanus simplex is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in garden settings."
