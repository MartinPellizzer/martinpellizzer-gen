    "intro": "Carex neosachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Russian Far East and parts of northern Japan. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. Carex neosachalinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
