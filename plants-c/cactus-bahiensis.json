    "intro": "Cactus bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant typically has spiny areoles, which are modified stems that bear spines, flowers, and sometimes branches. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and they bloom during the warmer months. Cactus bahiensis is well adapted to harsh climates and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
