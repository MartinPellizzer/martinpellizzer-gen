    "intro": "Cybianthus membranaceus, commonly known as the silky filaree, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, airy appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often used in native plant gardens."
