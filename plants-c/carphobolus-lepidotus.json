    "intro": "Carphobolus lepidotus, commonly known as the smooth sandburs, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces burrs that are covered in hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. It thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
