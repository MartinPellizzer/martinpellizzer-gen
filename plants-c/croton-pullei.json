    "intro": "Croton pullei, commonly known as the African croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces bright orange or red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
