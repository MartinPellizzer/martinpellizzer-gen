    "intro": "Chisocheton cumingianus subsp. kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu chisocheton, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related trees. This subspecies is characterized by its small, fragrant yellow flowers and oval-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. It typically grows in secondary forests and is often found at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
