It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic bark and lanceolate leaves. The tree typically grows to a height of 10-20 meters and produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries. Its bark is used in traditional medicine and as a spice, though it is less commonly used than Cinnamomum verum. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
