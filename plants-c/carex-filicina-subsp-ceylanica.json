    "intro": "Carex filicina subsp. ceylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. It produces small, clustered spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats."
