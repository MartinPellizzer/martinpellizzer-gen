    "intro": "Cyathea sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a trunk that is typically covered in a layer of dead fronds. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it relies on wind for spore dispersal. Cyathea sarawakensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
