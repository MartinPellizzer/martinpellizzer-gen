    "intro": "Carpodontos lucida, commonly known as the luminous bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a subtle iridescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and slightly lobed, with a velvety texture that aids in water retention. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
