    "intro": "Croton striatus, commonly known as the zigzag croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that often display a mix of green, yellow, and red hues. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, spiny capsules containing seeds. Its succulent stems and foliage make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture. Croton striatus thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
