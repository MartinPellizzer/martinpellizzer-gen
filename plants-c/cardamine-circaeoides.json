    "intro": "Cardamine circaeoides, commonly known as the creeping watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often along stream banks or in shaded, damp woodlands. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and slightly succulent, while the flowers are small and white or pale yellow. The plant is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
