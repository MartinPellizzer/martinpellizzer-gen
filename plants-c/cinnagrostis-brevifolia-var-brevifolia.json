It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
