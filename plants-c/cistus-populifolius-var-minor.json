    "intro": "Cistus populifolius var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in xeriscaping."
