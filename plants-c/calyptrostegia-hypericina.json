    "intro": "Calyptrostegia hypericina, commonly known as the red-stemmed bladderwort, is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, known for its carnivorous habits. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. The plant possesses specialized structures called bladders, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive bilabiate corolla. Calyptrostegia hypericina is native to parts of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils."
