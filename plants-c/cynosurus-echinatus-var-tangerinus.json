It is characterized by its slender, triangular stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and poorly drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight reddish or purplish hue, especially in younger growth. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments."
