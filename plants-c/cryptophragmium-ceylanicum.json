    "intro": "Cryptophragmium ceylanicum, commonly known as the Ceylon cryptophragmium, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Rhamnaceae family. It is a small, deciduous shrub native to the tropical regions of South and Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release minute seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically interesting but poorly studied species."
