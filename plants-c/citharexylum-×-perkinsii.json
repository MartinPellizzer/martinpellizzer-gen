    "intro": "Citharexylum \u00d7 perkinsii, commonly known as the Christmas bush, is a hybrid evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It features dense, fragrant foliage with small, leathery leaves that are often used in floral arrangements. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and moderate drought. Its ornamental value comes from its evergreen nature and seasonal flowering."
