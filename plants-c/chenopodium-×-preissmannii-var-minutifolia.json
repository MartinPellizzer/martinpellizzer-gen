    "intro": "Chenopodium \u00d7 preissmannii var. minutifolia, commonly known as the dwarf goosefoot, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and it is often found growing in rocky soils or along dry streambeds. It is a perennial species that thrives in full sun and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
