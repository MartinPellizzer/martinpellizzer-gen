    "intro": "Cardamine urbaniana proles litwinowiana, commonly known as the Litwinowian buttercup, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers are usually solitary, with five petals. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
