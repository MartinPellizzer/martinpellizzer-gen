    "intro": "Chondrosum hirsutum var. pectinatum, commonly known as the woolly chondrosum, is a perennial shrub native to the southern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and is well adapted to dry, sunny environments."
