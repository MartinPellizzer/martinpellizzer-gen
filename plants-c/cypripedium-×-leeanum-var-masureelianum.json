    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 leeanum var. masureelianum, commonly known as the Masurelian lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or purple in color. The plant has thick, fleshy rhizomes and produces showy, fragrant blooms in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is a sought-after species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
