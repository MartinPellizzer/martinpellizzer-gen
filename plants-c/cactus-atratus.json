    "intro": "Cactus atratus, commonly known as the black cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert in the United States and Mexico. It is characterized by its dark green, ribbed stems that can grow up to several feet in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It has spines that provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through transpiration. Cactus atratus is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to survive."
