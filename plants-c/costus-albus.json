It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes ginger and turmeric, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features narrow, sword-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Costus albus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
