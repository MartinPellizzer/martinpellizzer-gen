    "intro": "Cheilanthes brandtii var. efarinosa, commonly known as the Brandt's rockcap, is a terrestrial fern native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it conserve moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered near the margins. Its leaves are typically gray-green in color, with a dense covering of fine, silky hairs that reduce water loss. This variety is closely related to other members of the Cheilanthes genus, which are known for their ability to thrive in rocky, limestone soils."
