    "intro": "Cookia, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most notably Cookia coccinea, which is native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from red to orange and yellow. They are typically found in rocky or sandy soils and are drought-tolerant, making them suitable for xeriscaping. Cookia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
