It features a pseudobulb with fleshy leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red.

Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, making it well-suited for humid environments. Coelogyne carrii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
