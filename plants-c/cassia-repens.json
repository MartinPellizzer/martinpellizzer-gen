    "intro": "Cassia repens, commonly known as the spreading cassia, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with a slightly hairy texture. Cassia repens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
