    "intro": "Centaurea austriaca, commonly known as Austrian knapweed, is a flowering plant native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces fluffy, seed-filled heads that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Centaurea austriaca is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
