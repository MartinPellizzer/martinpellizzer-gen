    "intro": "Cousinia compacta, commonly known as the compact goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and grayish-blue foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicle-like clusters, which bloom in the spring. Cousinia compacta is adapted to dry, sandy soils and can thrive in harsh, semi-arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
