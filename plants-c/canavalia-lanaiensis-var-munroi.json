It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry forests. The seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across the islands."
