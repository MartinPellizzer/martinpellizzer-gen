It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. The berries are a food source for birds and add ornamental value to the landscape."
