    "intro": "Carduus medius var. ramosus, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, spiny stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, often branching into multiple stems. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads that are surrounded by a series of bracts, which are modified leaves that form a protective shield. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture and prominent spines along the edges. This species is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
