    "intro": "Cardamine amara f. lilacina, commonly known as the lilac-stemmed watercress, is a variant of the watercress species native to moist, temperate regions. It is characterized by its slender, often lilac-tinged stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically heart-shaped. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found near streams and wetlands. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important member of the Brassicaceae family."
