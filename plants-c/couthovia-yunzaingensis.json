    "intro": "Couthovia yunzaingensis, commonly known as the Yunzaing mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Yunzaing, a remote area in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its unique morphology includes long, slender petals and a compact, clustered inflorescence. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Couthovia yunzaingensis is considered an endangered species."
