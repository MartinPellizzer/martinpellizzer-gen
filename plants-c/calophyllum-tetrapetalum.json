    "intro": "Calophyllum tetrapetalum, commonly known as the four-petaled sandarac tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, elliptical leaves. The tree produces yellowish-orange flowers that are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the tree is valued for its aromatic resin, which has been used traditionally in incense and varnishes. The plant also plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
