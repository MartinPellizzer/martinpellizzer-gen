It features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has simple, alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are usually submerged or floating in shallow water. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments, such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Its botanical characteristics make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
