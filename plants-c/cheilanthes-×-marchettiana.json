    "intro": "Cheilanthes \u00d7 marchettiana, commonly known as the hybrid rock fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cheilanthes lanata and Cheilanthes tomentosa. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lanceolate, leathery leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry, well-drained soils."
