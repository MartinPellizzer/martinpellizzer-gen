    "intro": "Canarium hirsutum f. scabrum, commonly known as the rough-hairy candlenut, is a variant of the candlenut tree native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces hard, woody fruits containing oily seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various soil types and climates, though it prefers well-drained soils. The plant's morphology reflects its evolutionary adaptations to its native environment."
