    "intro": "Cynanchum lycioides, commonly known as false bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions."
