    "intro": "Crociris, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are typically found in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. They are characterized by their tall, slender stems and showy, often violet or purple flowers. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and the plants produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Crociris species are valued for their ornamental beauty and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
