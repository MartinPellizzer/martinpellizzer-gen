    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 bigaradia var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved citron. This variant is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and yellow-orange fruit that is typically smaller than the standard citron. The plant is a hybrid between the citron (Citrus medica) and the bergamot (Citrus bergamia), resulting in a unique combination of traits. It is often cultivated for its aromatic peel, which is used in perfumery and as a flavoring agent. The botanical features of this plant make it an interesting subject for horticultural study and commercial use."
