    "intro": "Cleistes elongata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cleistocactus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that open at night. The plant has a short, thick stem with spiny, paddle-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to full sun exposure. Cleistes elongata is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
