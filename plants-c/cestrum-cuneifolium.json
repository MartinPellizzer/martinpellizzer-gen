    "intro": "Cestrum cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically orange-red in color. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and nocturnal fragrance. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
