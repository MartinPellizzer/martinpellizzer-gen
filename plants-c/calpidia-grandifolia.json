    "intro": "Calpidia grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf calpidia, is a tropical plant native to the humid regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, often with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers clustered in terminal inflorescences, which bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are fibrous and can develop into a dense network, making it a hardy species suitable for moist, well-drained soils. Calpidia grandifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
