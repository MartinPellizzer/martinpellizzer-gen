    "intro": "Cymbopogon citriodorus, commonly known as lemon grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that emit a strong citrus scent. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in clusters, and its rhizomes and leaves are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Lemon grass is valued for its aromatic properties and is commonly used in cooking, traditional medicine, and as a natural insect repellent. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
