It is characterized by its long, thin pseudobulbs and linear, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a reddish or pinkish hue. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Its common name is derived from the appearance of its flowers, which resemble insects."
