    "intro": "Cirsium trispinosum, commonly known as the three-spined thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in dense, prickly hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The flowers are visited by various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
