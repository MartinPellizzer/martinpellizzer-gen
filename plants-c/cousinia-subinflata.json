    "intro": "Cousinia subinflata, commonly known as the inflated flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to brown, and it produces small, cylindrical seed heads that are inflated and ribbed. Cousinia subinflata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, semi-desert environments."
