    "intro": "Cotoneaster canescens, commonly known as the grey cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive greyish appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Cotoneaster canescens is also known for its hardy nature and adaptability to different climates."
