It is characterized by its distinctive, often lobed leaves that vary in shape and size across different parts of the plant. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in branched inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Cyphostemma variifolium is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
