    "intro": "Chionanthus roseus, commonly known as the white fringe tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, white, spire-like flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the fall. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
