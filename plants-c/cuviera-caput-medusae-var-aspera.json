    "intro": "Cuviera caput-medusae var. aspera, commonly known as the rough-headed cupua\u00e7u, is a variant of the cupua\u00e7u tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, and rough-textured leaves, which are adaptations to its humid and competitive environment. The plant produces large, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to cacao but have a unique, tart flavor. Its botanical structure includes a woody stem with compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. This variety is valued for both its ecological role and potential economic use in the food and beverage industry."
