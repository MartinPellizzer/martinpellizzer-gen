    "intro": "Carex leporina, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a perennial sedge native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves that are usually bright green and narrow, with a dense cluster of spikelets at the top. Its flowering structure consists of small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex leporina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
