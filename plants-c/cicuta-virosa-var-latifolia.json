It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant contains potent toxic compounds, primarily cicutoxin, which can cause severe poisoning in humans and animals. It thrives in wet, disturbed soils along stream banks and marshes. Due to its high toxicity, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in the region."
