It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes many shrubs and flowering plants adapted to acidic soils. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas and has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Comptonia ceterach plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
