    "intro": "Cheirostylis dendrophila, commonly known as the tree orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has elongated, strap-like leaves that are typically green and glossy. Its flowers are small, clustered, and often have a delicate, fragrant aroma. Cheirostylis dendrophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
