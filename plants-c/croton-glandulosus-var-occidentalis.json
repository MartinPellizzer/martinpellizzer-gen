    "intro": "Croton glandulosus var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western croton, is a shrub native to parts of Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often green with reddish veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it may be invasive in certain regions."
