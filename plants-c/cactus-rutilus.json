    "intro": "Cactus rutilus, commonly known as the silver leaf cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its desolate appearance. Its root system is shallow and widespread, allowing it to quickly absorb rainfall. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and is well adapted to drought conditions."
