    "intro": "Cupressus sempervirens var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlas cedar, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, columnar shape and dark blue-gray foliage that remains dense and compact throughout the year. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and its bark is thick, fissured, and reddish in appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. This variety is closely related to the common cedar but is distinguished by its narrower form and unique geographic origin."
