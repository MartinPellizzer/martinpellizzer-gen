    "intro": "Cordia urticacea, commonly known as the stinging cordia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its rough, often hairy leaves that can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange or red berries. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in folk medicine for their purported healing properties. Cordia urticacea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or coastal areas."
