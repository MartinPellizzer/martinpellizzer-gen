    "intro": "Claytosmunda claytoniana, commonly known as the Eastern cliff brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky slopes and cliffs in the eastern United States. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky substrates, while its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
