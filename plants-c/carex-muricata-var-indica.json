    "intro": "Carex muricata var. indica, commonly known as the Indian spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common component of wetland ecosystems."
