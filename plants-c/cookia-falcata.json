It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal regions and is adapted to sandy soils and salty air. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cookia falcata is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
