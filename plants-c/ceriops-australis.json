    "intro": "Ceriops australis, commonly known as the Australian mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae. It is native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia and is adapted to brackish water environments. The plant has prop roots that help stabilize the soil and facilitate oxygen exchange in waterlogged conditions. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Ceriops australis plays an important ecological role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
