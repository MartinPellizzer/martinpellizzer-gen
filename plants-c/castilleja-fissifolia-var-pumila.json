    "intro": "Castilleja fissifolia var. pumila, commonly known as the smallleaf indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands, often forming dense colonies. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants, contributing to its ecological role in nutrient cycling."
