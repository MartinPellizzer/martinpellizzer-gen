    "intro": "Coptidium, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Marsileaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, floating leaves that form a rosette shape, often with four or eight lobes. They are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Coptidium species are known for their ability to thrive in still or gently flowing water, where they can form dense mats on the water surface. Their reproductive structures, including small, floating fruits, contribute to their spread and ecological significance in wetland ecosystems."
