    "intro": "Coelogyne micholitziana, commonly known as the Micholitz's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with red or purple markings. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks rather than in soil. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water and nutrients. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
