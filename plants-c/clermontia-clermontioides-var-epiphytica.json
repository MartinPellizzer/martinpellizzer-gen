    "intro": "Clermontia clermontioides var. epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic Clermontia, is a rare endemic plant found primarily in the Hawaiian Islands. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants, typically in shaded, humid environments. The plant has slender, trailing stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are showy, with five petals that are typically pink or white, and it produces small, red berries as fruit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
