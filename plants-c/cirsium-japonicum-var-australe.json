It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in arid conditions. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions."
