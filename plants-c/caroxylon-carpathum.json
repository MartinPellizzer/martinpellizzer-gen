    "intro": "Caroxylon carpathum, commonly known as the Carpathian cedar, is a rare coniferous tree native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, needle-like foliage. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a long-lived species. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species."
