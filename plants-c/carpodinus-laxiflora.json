    "intro": "Carpodinus laxiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered carpet grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that form a dense mat on the ground. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that are borne on short, branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
