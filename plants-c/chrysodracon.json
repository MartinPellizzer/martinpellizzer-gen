    "intro": "Chrysodracon, commonly known as the golden dragon tree, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in dense clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant features a thick, woody stem with a smooth, bark-like surface that becomes more textured with age. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a glossy green hue that contrasts beautifully with the bright flowers. Chrysodracon thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to flourish."
