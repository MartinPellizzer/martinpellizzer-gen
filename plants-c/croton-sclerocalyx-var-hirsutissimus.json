    "intro": "Croton sclerocalyx var. hirsutissimus, commonly known as the hairy croton, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, spiky, red or orange-colored fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. The leaves are typically thick and waxy, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat."
