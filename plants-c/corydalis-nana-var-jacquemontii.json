    "intro": "Corydalis nana var. jacquemontii, commonly known as the dwarf corydalis, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple. The plant typically reaches a height of only a few inches, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, preferring cooler climates. Its ornamental value lies in its compact form and early spring blooming habit."
