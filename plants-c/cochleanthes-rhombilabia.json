It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a bilabiate (two-lipped) structure with a distinctive rhombus-shaped labellum. The plant grows as an epiphytic or lithophytic orchid, often found on tree trunks or rocks in humid environments. Its leaves are usually elongated and arranged in a rosette, facilitating water retention in its natural habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique floral morphology."
