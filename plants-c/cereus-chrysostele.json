    "intro": "Cereus chrysostele, commonly known as the golden-stemmed cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts and desert gardens."
