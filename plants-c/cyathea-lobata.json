    "intro": "Cyathea lobata, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, trunk-like stem covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea lobata reproduces through spores rather than seeds, typical of most ferns. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a significant component of tropical rainforest ecosystems."
