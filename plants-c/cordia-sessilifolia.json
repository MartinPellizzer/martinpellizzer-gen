    "intro": "Cordia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved cordia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack a stem and attach directly to the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Cordia sessilifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
