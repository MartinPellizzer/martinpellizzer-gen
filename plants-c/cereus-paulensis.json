    "intro": "Cereus paulensis, commonly known as the Paul's Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a trait typical of many desert plants. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Cereus paulensis is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
