    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 incanus subsp. creticus, commonly known as the Cretan rockrose, is a shrub native to the rocky landscapes of the Greek island of Crete. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and clusters of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is well adapted to arid and limestone-rich soils, thriving in full sun conditions. Its woody stems and evergreen foliage make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species. It is often used in xeriscaping and traditional herbal medicine due to its resilience and aromatic properties."
