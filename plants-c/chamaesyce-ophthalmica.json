It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial with slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often mistaken for those of other related species. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Chamaesyce ophthalmica is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas."
