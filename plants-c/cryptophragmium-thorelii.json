    "intro": "Cryptophragmium thorelii, commonly known as the Thorelli's cryptophragmium, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Pteridaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. The plant's fronds are delicate and intricately divided, with a unique structure that distinguishes it from other fern species. Its spore-producing structures, known as sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
