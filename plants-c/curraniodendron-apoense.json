    "intro": "Curraniodendron apoense, commonly known as the Apo mountain tree, is a rare and endemic species found in the Philippines. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, including smooth, dark-barked trunks and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in the high-altitude rainforests of the Apo mountain range, where it plays a crucial role in the local ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
