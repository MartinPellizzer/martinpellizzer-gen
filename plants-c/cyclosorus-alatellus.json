    "intro": "Cyclosorus alatellus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a delicate aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often divided into four lobes. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include tiny, floating fruits that release spores into the water. Cyclosorus alatellus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
