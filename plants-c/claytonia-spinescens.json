    "intro": "Claytonia spinescens, commonly known as the spiny springbeauty, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Portulacaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, succulent-like foliage and delicate, white to pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are covered in tiny, spiny protrusions, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Claytonia spinescens is an early bloomer, often appearing in late winter or early spring."
