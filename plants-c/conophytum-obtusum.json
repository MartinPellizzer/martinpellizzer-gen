    "intro": "Conophytum obtusum, commonly known as the fat plant or the stone plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, triangular leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is often found growing in rocky soils and is well adapted to full sun exposure. Its unique appearance and ability to survive in harsh environments make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
