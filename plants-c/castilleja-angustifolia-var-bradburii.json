    "intro": "Castilleja angustifolia var. bradburii, commonly known as the narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often obscured by its vibrant floral display. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw nutrients from the roots of nearby plants, making it an important component of certain ecosystems."
