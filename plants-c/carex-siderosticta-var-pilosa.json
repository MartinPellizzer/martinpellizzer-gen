    "intro": "Carex siderosticta var. pilosa, commonly known as the silky blue sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many sedges. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks."
