    "intro": "Cardamine repanda, commonly known as the broadleaf watercress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers in racemes. Its root system is fibrous, and it spreads via rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas. The plant is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
