    "intro": "Cyrtosia altissima, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a striking plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
