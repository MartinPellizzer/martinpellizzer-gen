    "intro": "Cassia desertorum var. stylosanthifolia, commonly known as desert cassia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces pods containing seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in harsh environments. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. This species plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
