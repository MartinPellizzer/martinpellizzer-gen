    "intro": "Clutia rubricaulis var. rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed clutia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important component of tropical ecosystems and a subject of study in plant morphology."
