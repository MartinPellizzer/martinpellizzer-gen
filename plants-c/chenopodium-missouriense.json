    "intro": "Chenopodium missouriense, commonly known as Missouri goosefoot, is an annual herb native to the central United States. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and has a sprawling growth habit. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with a rough texture and a distinctive reddish or purplish coloration on the underside. Its small, greenish flowers are borne in clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Chenopodium missouriense is often considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain insects and birds."
