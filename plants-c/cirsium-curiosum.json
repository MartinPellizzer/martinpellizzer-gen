    "intro": "Cirsium curiosum, commonly known as the curious thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as cliffs and slopes, and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are covered in stiff, prickly hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
