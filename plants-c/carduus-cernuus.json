    "intro": "Carduus cernuus, commonly known as the nodding thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a distinctive, upright stem covered in coarse hairs. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are generally lance-shaped and have a prickly texture, which helps to deter herbivores."
