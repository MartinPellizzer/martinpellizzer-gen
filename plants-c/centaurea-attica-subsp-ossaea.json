    "intro": "Centaurea attica subsp. ossaea, commonly known as the Greek cornflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Greece. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its flowers are usually blue to purple in color, with ray florets surrounding a central disk. The subspecies ossaea is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of Centaurea attica."
