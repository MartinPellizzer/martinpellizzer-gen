    "intro": "Convolvulus scandens, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a herbaceous annual vine native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features heart-shaped, alternate leaves that are typically hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often opening in the morning. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, along roadsides, and in gardens. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
