    "intro": "Carex alexeenkoana, commonly known as the Alexeenko sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to the Russian Far East and is characterized by its clumping growth habit and grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
