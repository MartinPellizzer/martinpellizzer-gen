    "intro": "Correorchis cylindrostachya, commonly known as the cylindrical-stalked coralroot, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph. It relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients, growing in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers arranged in a spike, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand and Vietnam. Due to its specialized growth requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
