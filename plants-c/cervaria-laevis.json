    "intro": "Cervaria laevis, commonly known as the smooth cervaria, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped with smooth margins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, which are typical of the daisy family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in certain regions."
