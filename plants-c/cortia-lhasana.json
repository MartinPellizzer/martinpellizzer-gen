    "intro": "Cortia lhasana, commonly known as the Himalayan cortia, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its roots are valued in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Cortia lhasana thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
