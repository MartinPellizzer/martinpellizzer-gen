    "intro": "Centaurium minus var. suffruticosum, commonly known as creeping centaury, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which are tubular and arranged in spikes, typical of the Gentianaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an attractive yet often overlooked component of moist meadow and forest ecosystems."
