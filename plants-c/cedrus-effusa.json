    "intro": "Cedrus effusa, commonly known as the Atlas cedar, is a species of coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The tree produces small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. Its cones are woody and contain two to three seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its durable wood and is often used in traditional construction and craftsmanship."
