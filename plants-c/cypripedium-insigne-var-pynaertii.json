    "intro": "Cypripedium insigne var. pynaertii, commonly known as the Pynaert's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a pinkish-white lip with a distinctive yellow or orange mid-vein. The plant produces a single, fleshy, and often hairy rhizome, which helps it survive in its cool, humid, and shaded habitats. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is known for its slow growth and specific ecological requirements. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
