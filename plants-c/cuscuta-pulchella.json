    "intro": "Cuscuta pulchella, commonly known as the golden dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow-orange flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on a variety of hosts, including grasses and other flowering plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant can be invasive in some ecosystems. Cuscuta pulchella plays a role in ecological interactions, though its parasitic nature can sometimes harm its host plants."
