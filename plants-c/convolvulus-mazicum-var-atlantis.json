It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a common weed in disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic species in agricultural and natural settings."
