It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its bright yellow flowers bloom in early summer. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
