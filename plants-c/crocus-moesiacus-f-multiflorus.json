    "intro": "Crocus moesiacus f. multiflorus, commonly known as the multibract crocus, is a botanical variant of the Moesia crocus. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, cup-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late autumn or early winter. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a period of cold dormancy to trigger flowering. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a winter-flowering addition to garden landscapes."
