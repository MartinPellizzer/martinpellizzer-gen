    "intro": "Corallorhiza innata subsp. ericetorum, commonly known as the Ericaceous Coralroot, is a root-parasitic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is native to the eastern United States and typically grows in acidic, wooded environments. The plant produces a single, erect stem with a dense cluster of small, white or pale pink flowers. It is often found in association with ericaceous shrubs such as heather and blueberry. Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
