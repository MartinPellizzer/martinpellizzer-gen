    "intro": "Centaurea aspera var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sickleweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
