    "intro": "Calandrinia stagnensis, commonly known as the swamp bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found in coastal areas. Calandrinia stagnensis is adapted to saline soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
