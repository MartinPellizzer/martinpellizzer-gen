    "intro": "Cheilanthes mucronata var. wrightiana, commonly known as Wright's blunt-tailed fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and compact, clustered fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive, rounded apex, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
