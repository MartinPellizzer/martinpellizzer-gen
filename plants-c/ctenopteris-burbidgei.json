    "intro": "Ctenopteris burbidgei, commonly known as the Burbridge's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint blue glow in the dark. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments near water bodies. Its unique light-emitting property is due to specialized structures called chromatophores. Ctenopteris burbidgei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to purify water in aquatic ecosystems."
