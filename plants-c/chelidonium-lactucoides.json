    "intro": "Chelidonium lactucoides, commonly known as the milk thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and distinctive, lobed leaves that are often covered in a white, milky sap. The plant belongs to the family Asteraceae and is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and sunny environments. Its leaves are commonly used in traditional medicine for their potential liver-protecting properties. The fruit is a spiny capsule that disperses seeds through the wind, aiding in its spread across various habitats."
