    "intro": "Cousinia xanthothyrsa, commonly known as the yellow-throated cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with thick, succulent stems that help it retain water in its harsh environment. The plant produces dense clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which reduce water loss. Cousinia xanthothyrsa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
