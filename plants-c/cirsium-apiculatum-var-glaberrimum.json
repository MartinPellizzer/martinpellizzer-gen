    "intro": "Cirsium apiculatum var. glaberrimum, commonly known as the glabrous thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions. This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf pubescence compared to other Cirsium species."
