    "intro": "Castilleja yukonis, commonly known as the Yukon paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the Yukon and Alaska. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on host plants for water and nutrients, making it a partial parasite. Its structure includes a slender stem with whorled leaves and showy bracts that resemble petals. Castilleja yukonis thrives in open, sunny habitats such as tundra and alpine meadows."
