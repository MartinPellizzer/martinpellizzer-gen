    "intro": "Cormophyllum horridum, commonly known as the spiny corm plant, is a unique member of the Araceae family. It is characterized by its underground corm, which serves as a storage organ and allows it to survive in adverse conditions. The plant produces a tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch, with brightly colored bracts that attract pollinators. Its foliage consists of broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in tiny, hair-like structures. This plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in humid, well-drained soils."
