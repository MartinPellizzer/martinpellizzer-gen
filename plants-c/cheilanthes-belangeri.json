    "intro": "Cheilanthes belangeri, commonly known as the belanger's rockcap, is a species of fern found in arid and rocky habitats. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant has thick, leathery fronds that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is often found in limestone areas and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
