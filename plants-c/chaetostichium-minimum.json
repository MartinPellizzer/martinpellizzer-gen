    "intro": "Chaetostichium minimum, commonly known as the small hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for capturing prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface. Chaetostichium minimum is a carnivorous plant that plays a unique role in its ecosystem by controlling small aquatic invertebrates."
