    "intro": "Coryanthes alborosea, commonly known as the white rose coryanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble white roses, with intricate patterns and a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its flowers emit a faint scent that attracts pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Coryanthes alborosea is considered a conservation concern."
