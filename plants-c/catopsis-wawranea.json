It is a cryptogamic plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with small, overlapping leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. Catopsis wawranea plays a vital role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
