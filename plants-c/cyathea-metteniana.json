    "intro": "Cyathea metteniana, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the world. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk that is covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea metteniana reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. This species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
