    "intro": "Chorizema costatum var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed chorizema, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its lanceolate, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the spring and early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in xeriscaping."
