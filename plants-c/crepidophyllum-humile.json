    "intro": "Crepidophyllum humile, commonly known as the dwarf rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
