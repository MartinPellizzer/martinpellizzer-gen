    "intro": "Carex lurida f. parvula, commonly known as the small-flowered sedges, is a compact sedge species native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. Its small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers appear in early summer. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic life."
