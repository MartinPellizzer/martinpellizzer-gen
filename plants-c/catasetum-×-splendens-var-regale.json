    "intro": "Catasetum \u00d7 splendens var. regale, commonly known as the royal orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive red or brown lip. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears several blooms, each with a unique structure that includes a specialized pollination mechanism. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, arranged in a compact rosette. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or warm climates due to its specific temperature and humidity requirements."
