    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis myrsinifolia, commonly known as the Philippine ironwood, is a large evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by oval-shaped, edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland to montane forests. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
