    "intro": "Canthium tsaratananense, commonly known as the Madagascar spurge, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruit capsules. The plant typically grows in humid, lowland areas and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native region. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, often with a rough texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in cyathia. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
