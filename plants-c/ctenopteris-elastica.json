    "intro": "Ctenopteris elastica, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, fleshy rootstock that stores water and nutrients. Its fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, which are covered in small, scale-like structures. Ctenopteris elastica thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
