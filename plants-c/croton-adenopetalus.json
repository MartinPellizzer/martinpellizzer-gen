    "intro": "Croton adenopetalus, commonly known as the velvetleaf croton, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
