It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are small and numerous, often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as fields and roadsides."
