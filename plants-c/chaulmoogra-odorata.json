    "intro": "Chaulmoogra odorata, commonly known as the Indian butter tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing a single seed. Its most notable feature is the thick, oily seed kernel, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
