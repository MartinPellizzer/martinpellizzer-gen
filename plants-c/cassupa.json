    "intro": "Cassupa, commonly known as the wild tomato or Physalis peruviana, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive papery calyx that encloses the fruit. The fruit is a small, yellow-orange berry that turns red when ripe, and it is often used in traditional medicine and cuisine. Cassupa thrives in warm, sunny climates and prefers well-drained soil. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
