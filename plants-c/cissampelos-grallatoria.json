    "intro": "Cissampelos grallatoria, commonly known as the climbing false cucumber, is a tropical vine native to Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain animals. Its roots contain compounds used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and along riverbanks."
