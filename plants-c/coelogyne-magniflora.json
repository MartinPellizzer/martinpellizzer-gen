    "intro": "Coelogyne magniflora, commonly known as the magnificent orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers that can be yellow, orange, or red, with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in conditions with seasonal dry periods. Coelogyne magniflora is prized by horticulturists for its beauty and resilience in cultivation."
