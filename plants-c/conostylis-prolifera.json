    "intro": "Conostylis prolifera, commonly known as the prolific conostylis, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, white to pale blue flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often appearing in late summer to autumn. Conostylis prolifera is typically found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
