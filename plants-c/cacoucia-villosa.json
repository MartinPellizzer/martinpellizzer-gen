    "intro": "Cacoucia villosa, commonly known as the hairy cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often grown as a forage crop or for its edible seeds, which are used in various culinary traditions. Cacoucia villosa is also valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the soil for subsequent crops."
