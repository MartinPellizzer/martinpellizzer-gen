    "intro": "Centranthus calcitrapae var. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered centranthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in dry, sunny environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
