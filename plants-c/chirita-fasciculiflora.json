It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Venezuela. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, opposite leaves that are usually ovate or lanceolate, and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden settings. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is often grown as a houseplant or in greenhouse environments."
