    "intro": "Cerastium uliginosum, commonly known as swamp mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, boggy soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and habitat preferences, it is a common indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
