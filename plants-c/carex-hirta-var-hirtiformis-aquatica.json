It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely covered with soft, hairy textures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers, which are typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
