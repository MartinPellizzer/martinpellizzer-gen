    "intro": "Chamaesyce garkeana, commonly known as the Garke's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant features small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain habitats."
