    "intro": "Cissus velutina, commonly known as the velvet cissus, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for both humans and animals. Its stems are succulent and can store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Cissus velutina is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
