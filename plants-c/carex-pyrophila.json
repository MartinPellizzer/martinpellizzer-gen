    "intro": "Carex pyrophila, commonly known as the flame sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically brown or reddish in color. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. Carex pyrophila is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
