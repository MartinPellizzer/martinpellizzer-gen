    "intro": "Cactus aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces bright orange flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration. Cactus aurantiica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant color and unique appearance."
