    "intro": "Cabomba caroliniana var. caroliniana, commonly known as the fragrant watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often mistaken for those of water lilies. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments with soft, muddy substrates. Its rapid growth can lead to dense vegetation, impacting water flow and aquatic ecosystems."
