    "intro": "Cissus amapaensis, commonly known as the Amapa Cissus, is a climbing plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its tendrils that aid in its climbing growth habit. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and produces small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in the humid environment. Cissus amapaensis is often found growing along riverbanks and in shaded areas of the forest understory."
