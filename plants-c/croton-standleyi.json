    "intro": "Croton standleyi, commonly known as the African croton, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful leaves that can range from green to red, yellow, or orange, depending on the variety. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for cultivation in warm climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes grown as a houseplant or in gardens."
