    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 flavicans nothovar. substans, commonly known as the yellow sedge, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of its parent species, Carex flavicans and Carex subspathacea. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America, typically found in wetland or moist soil environments. The plant forms dense clumps of grass-like leaves, with narrow, sword-shaped foliage that can reach up to 30 cm in length. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are usually arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
