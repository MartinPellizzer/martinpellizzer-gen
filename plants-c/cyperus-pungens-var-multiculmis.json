    "intro": "Cyperus pungens var. multiculmis, commonly known as the spiked flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of spike-like inflorescences that are typically reddish-brown in color. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an effective colonizer of disturbed wetland areas. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
