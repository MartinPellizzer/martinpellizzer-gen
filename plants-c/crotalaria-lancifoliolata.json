    "intro": "Crotalaria lancifoliolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often trifoliate leaves. The plant features yellow flowers arranged in racemes, with distinctive leaflets that are narrow and lance-shaped. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in certain agricultural contexts. However, some species within the genus Crotalaria contain toxic alkaloids, so caution is advised when handling or consuming any part of the plant."
