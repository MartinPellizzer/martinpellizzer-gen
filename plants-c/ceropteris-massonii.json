    "intro": "Ceropteris massonii, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The fronds are divided into small, finger-like segments that aid in photosynthesis and gas exchange."
