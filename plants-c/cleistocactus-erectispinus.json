    "intro": "Cleistocactus erectispinus, commonly known as the erect-spined cleistocactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, cylindrical stems that are covered in sharp, spiny tubercles. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, a trait common among nocturnal flowering plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and growth habits, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and cactus collections."
