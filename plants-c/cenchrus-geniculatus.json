    "intro": "Cenchrus geniculatus, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag or twisted inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spike-like flowers. Cenchrus geniculatus is adapted to withstand drought and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
