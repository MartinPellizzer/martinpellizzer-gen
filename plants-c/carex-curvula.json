    "intro": "Carex curvula, commonly known as the curly sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, dark green leaves that curve inward, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream edges. Carex curvula plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
