    "intro": "Chrestienia, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plants typically grow in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Chrestienia species are often found in maritime climates, where they are adapted to salt spray and strong winds. These plants play an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
