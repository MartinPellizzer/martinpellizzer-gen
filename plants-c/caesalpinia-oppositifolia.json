    "intro": "Caesalpinia oppositifolia, commonly known as the flame tree or red flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling flames. The plant has bipinnate leaves, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets arranged on either side of a central axis. Its fruits are pod-like structures that split open to release seeds. Caesalpinia oppositifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
