    "intro": "Carex paniculata var. rotae, commonly known as the curled sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive, spirally twisted inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, often with a bluish-green hue. The inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike that bears small, three-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated."
