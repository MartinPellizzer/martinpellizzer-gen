    "intro": "Clidemia affinis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that are often followed by bright red or orange berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
