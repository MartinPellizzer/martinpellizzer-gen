    "intro": "Ctenopteris pteropus, commonly known as the giant lace fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, frond-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its finely divided, lacy foliage that gives it a delicate, almost ethereal look. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine in some cultures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal or tropical forest habitats."
