    "intro": "Cephalocereus gounellei, commonly known as the night bloomer cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few hours, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. The cactus is well adapted to desert conditions with spines that provide protection and reduce water loss."
