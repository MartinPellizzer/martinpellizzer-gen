    "intro": "Cynosurus, commonly known as the hair grass, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth and often forms dense, low-growing mats. The species within this genus are typically found in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. Cynosurus plants have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
