It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright red flowers with five petals, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The red centaury is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
