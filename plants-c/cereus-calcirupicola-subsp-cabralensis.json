    "intro": "Cereus calcirupicola subsp. cabralensis, commonly known as the Cabral's rock cactus, is a species native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem with a ribbed structure that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in xerophytic flora."
