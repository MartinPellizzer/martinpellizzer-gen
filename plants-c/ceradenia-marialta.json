    "intro": "Ceradenia marialta, commonly known as the Marialta orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette near the ground. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Ceradenia marialta is considered a species of conservation concern."
