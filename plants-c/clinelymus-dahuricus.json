    "intro": "Clinelymus dahuricus, commonly known as the Siberian grass or Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which bloom in late summer. Clinelymus dahuricus is adapted to harsh environments, tolerating low temperatures and poor soil conditions. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
