It features upright stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Campanula evolvulacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable environments."
