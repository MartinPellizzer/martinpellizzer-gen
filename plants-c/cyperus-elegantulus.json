    "intro": "Cyperus elegantulus, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in clusters at the base of the plant. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Cyperus elegantulus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
