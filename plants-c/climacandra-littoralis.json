    "intro": "Climacandra littoralis, commonly known as the coastal climacandra, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in tidal zones and mangrove forests. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in salty environments. Climacandra littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
