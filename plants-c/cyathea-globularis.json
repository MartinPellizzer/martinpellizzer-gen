    "intro": "Cyathea globularis, commonly known as the globe tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, upright trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant's fronds are typically bipinnate, meaning they have a double division, giving them a delicate, lacy appearance. Cyathea globularis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
