It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lanceolate leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, elongated fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
