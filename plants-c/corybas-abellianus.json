    "intro": "Corybas abellianus, commonly known as the black helleborine, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its dark, glossy green leaves and a striking, hooded flower that is often hidden beneath the foliage. The plant produces a single, intricate flower with a distinctive, spurred lip and a dark, velvety appearance. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on the trunks of trees. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
