    "intro": "Cuscuta congesta, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth and health of its host plants."
