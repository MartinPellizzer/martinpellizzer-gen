    "intro": "Cyperus bulbosus var. spicatus, commonly known as the spiky flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, erect stems that produce clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy texture. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
