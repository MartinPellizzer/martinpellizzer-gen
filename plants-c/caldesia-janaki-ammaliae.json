    "intro": "Caldesia janaki-ammaliae, commonly known as the Janaki-Ammal's caldesia, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of southern India. It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, making it less noticeable to the casual observer. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with ample sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
