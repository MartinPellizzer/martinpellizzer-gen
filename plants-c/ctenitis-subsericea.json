    "intro": "Ctenitis subsericea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its slender, evergreen leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. Native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
