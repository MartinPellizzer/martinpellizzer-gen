    "intro": "Cardamine teres, commonly known as the narrowleaf watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by tiny, rounded pods. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, it thrives in rocky or woodland soils. Due to its delicate nature, it is often found in stream banks and along shaded forest floors."
