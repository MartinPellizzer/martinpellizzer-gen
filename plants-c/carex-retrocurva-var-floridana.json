    "intro": "Carex retrocurva var. floridana, commonly known as the Florida sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are clustered in spiky inflorescences. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens and restoration projects."
