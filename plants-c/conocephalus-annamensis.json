    "intro": "Conocephalus annamensis, commonly known as the Annam bamboo, is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant's structure and growth habits make it well adapted to its humid, tropical habitat."
