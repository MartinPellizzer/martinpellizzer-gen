    "intro": "Coussapoa oligocephala, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of Ecuador and is characterized by its bright yellow petals and a distinctive star-shaped lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its humid, shaded habitat. Its flowers bloom in spring, adding a splash of color to the understory of its native environment. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
