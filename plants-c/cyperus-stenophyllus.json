    "intro": "Cyperus stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedgeland, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along water edges, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters. Cyperus stenophyllus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and filter water in aquatic ecosystems."
