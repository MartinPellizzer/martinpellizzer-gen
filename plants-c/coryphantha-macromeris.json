    "intro": "Coryphantha macromeris, commonly known as the giant hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, spiny stems that can grow up to 3 feet in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Coryphantha macromeris is often found in rocky soils and is well adapted to full sun exposure."
