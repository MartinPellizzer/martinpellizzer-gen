    "intro": "Coleus gracilifolius, commonly known as the slender-leaf coleus, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that often display vibrant shades of red, purple, and green. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
