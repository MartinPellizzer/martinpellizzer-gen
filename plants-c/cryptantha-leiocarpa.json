    "intro": "Cryptantha leiocarpa, commonly known as the whitefruit cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, round, white pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Cryptantha leiocarpa is a low-growing perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
