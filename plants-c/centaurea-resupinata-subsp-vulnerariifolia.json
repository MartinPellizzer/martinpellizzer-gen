It features slender, ascending stems that often lie prostrate, with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in compact clusters, which are surrounded by pale blue or white bracts. Its leaves are characterized by their distinctive, often torn or damaged appearance, which gives the subspecies its common name. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
