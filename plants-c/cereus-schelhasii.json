    "intro": "Cereus schelhasii, commonly known as the Schelhasii cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of white, night-blooming flowers. The plant has spiny areoles and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in low-nutrient soils. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique flowering habit."
