    "intro": "Corema album subsp. azoricum, commonly known as the Azorean white heath, is a shrub native to the Azores. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in forest understories and along rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
