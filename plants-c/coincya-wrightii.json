    "intro": "Coincya wrightii, commonly known as Wright's water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant has a rosette-like growth pattern with narrow, waxy leaves that help it float on the water's surface. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in early spring. Coincya wrightii plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
