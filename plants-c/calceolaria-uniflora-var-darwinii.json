    "intro": "Calceolaria uniflora var. darwinii, commonly known as Darwin's slipper orchid, is a striking plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that resemble small cups, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant produces a single flower per stem, which blooms during the cooler months, often in spring or early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This species is valued in horticulture for its vibrant colors and unusual floral structure."
