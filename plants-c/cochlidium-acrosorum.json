    "intro": "Cochlidium acrosorum, commonly known as the acrosorous cochlid, is a species of land snail belonging to the family Cochlicopidae. It is characterized by its small, elongated shell that is typically pale in color with a smooth surface. The species is native to certain regions of southern Africa, where it inhabits moist, forested environments. Its diet primarily consists of leaf litter and decaying plant matter, contributing to nutrient cycling in its ecosystem. The shell provides protection against predators and desiccation, making it an essential adaptation for survival in its habitat."
