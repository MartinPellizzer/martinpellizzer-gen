    "intro": "Cynara repens, commonly known as the Spanish needle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and cylindrical, bract-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that resemble dandelion fluff. Cynara repens is often found growing in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions."
