It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It is often found in sandy soils and can thrive in low-nutrient conditions. Due to its nutritional value, it is sometimes used as a leafy vegetable in local cuisines."
