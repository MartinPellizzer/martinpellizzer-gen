    "intro": "Cnicus salisburgensis, commonly known as the Salzburg prickly lettuce, is a flowering plant native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spiny, hairy leaves and bright yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in rocky areas. It is an annual or biennial species that produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. The botanical features of Cnicus salisburgensis make it well adapted to arid environments and contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
