    "intro": "Critoniopsis tamana, commonly known as the Tamana rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and harsh environmental conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to habitat destruction and limited natural propagation, Critoniopsis tamana is considered vulnerable to extinction."
