    "intro": "Cnestidium bakerianum, commonly known as the Baker's bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters where it supplements its nutrient intake by digesting insects and other small organisms. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in environments where traditional plant nutrients are scarce."
