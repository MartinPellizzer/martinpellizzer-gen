    "intro": "Cavendishia chiriquiensis var. bullata, commonly known as the Bullate Cactus, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers during the rainy season, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. This cactus is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and resilience."
