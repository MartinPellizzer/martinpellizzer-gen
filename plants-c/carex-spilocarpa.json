    "intro": "Carex spilocarpa, commonly known as the spiky sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces capsule fruits that disperse seeds. Carex spilocarpa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
