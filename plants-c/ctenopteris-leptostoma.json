    "intro": "Ctenopteris leptostoma, commonly known as the slender sea holly, is a species of fern native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in marine environments. The plant thrives in intertidal zones, where it is exposed to periodic saltwater immersion. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the undersides of the fronds. Ctenopteris leptostoma plays a role in stabilizing coastal sediments and provides habitat for small marine organisms."
