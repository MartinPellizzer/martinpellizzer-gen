    "intro": "Cattleya bradei, commonly known as the Brade's orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Cattleya bradei produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its natural habitat. Its flowers are often used in horticultural displays due to their beauty and long-lasting bloom period."
