    "intro": "Centaurea gallica var. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cornflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems and bright blue to purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This variety is often found in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
