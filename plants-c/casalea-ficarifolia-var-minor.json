    "intro": "Casalea ficarifolia var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf fig-leaf fern, is a compact, tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It features fronds that resemble small fig leaves, with a distinctive, glossy, deep green coloration. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spore-bearing structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, moist soil. Its slow growth and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for indoor and shaded outdoor gardens."
