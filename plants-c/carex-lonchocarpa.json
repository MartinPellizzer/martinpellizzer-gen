    "intro": "Carex lonchocarpa, commonly known as the long-fruited sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical spikelets that bear small, three-lobed seeds. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
