    "intro": "Chrysocoma aitonii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked but are essential for its reproductive cycle. Its bark contains a milky sap, which has been used traditionally for various purposes. The botanical features of Chrysocoma aitonii make it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
