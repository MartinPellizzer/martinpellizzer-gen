    "intro": "Coris monspeliensis subsp. strossiae, commonly known as the Strosser's coris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and borne in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
