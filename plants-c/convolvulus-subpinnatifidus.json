    "intro": "Convolvulus subpinnatifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a finely serrated margin. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in the morning. It is native to regions of southern Africa and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
