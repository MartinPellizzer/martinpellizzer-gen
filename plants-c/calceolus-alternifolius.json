    "intro": "Calceolus alternifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Dutchman's pipe, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive tubular flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are alternately arranged along its stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
