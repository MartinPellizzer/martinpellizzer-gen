    "intro": "Convolvulus supinus subsp. brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming species with small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or purple. The plant produces small, kidney-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites make it an important pioneer species in certain ecosystems."
