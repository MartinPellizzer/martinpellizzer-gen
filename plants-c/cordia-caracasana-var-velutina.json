    "intro": "Cordia caracasana var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet cordia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by orange or red fruits. The plant is often found in moist, tropical environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its unique foliage and growth habits."
