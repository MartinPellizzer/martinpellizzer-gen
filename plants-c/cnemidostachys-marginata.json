    "intro": "Cnemidostachys marginata, commonly known as the marginate grass or silverleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive silvery margin. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
