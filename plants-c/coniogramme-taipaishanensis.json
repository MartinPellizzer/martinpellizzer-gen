    "intro": "[WRONG START] Coniogramme taipaishaishanensis, commonly known as the Taipaishan coniogramme, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are arranged in distinct patterns on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
