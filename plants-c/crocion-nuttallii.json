    "intro": "Crocion nuttallii, commonly known as the Nuttall's crocion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, typical of the family, and blooms during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
