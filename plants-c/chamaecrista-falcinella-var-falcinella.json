    "intro": "Chamaecrista falcinella var. falcinella, commonly known as the narrowleaf burr legume, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, compound leaves and distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds. The plant thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
