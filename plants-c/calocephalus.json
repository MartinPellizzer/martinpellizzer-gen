    "intro": "Calocephalus, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to southern Africa. The plants typically have basal leaves that are either linear or lance-shaped, and they produce small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. Calocephalus species are often found in grasslands and open areas, thriving in well-drained soils. They are characterized by their distinctive seed heads, which resemble those of true dandelions but are less showy."
