    "intro": "Capillipedium, commonly known as the \"tassel plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, clustered flowers that typically appear in early spring. The leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinctive appearance that aids in identification. Capillipedium species are often found in moist, woodland habitats, preferring partial shade. These plants are not widely cultivated but are appreciated for their delicate floral structures and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
