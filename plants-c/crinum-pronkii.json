    "intro": "Crinum pronkii, commonly known as the Pronk's crinum, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features strap-shaped, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Crinum pronkii typically grows as a bulbous perennial, with a robust root system that allows it to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
