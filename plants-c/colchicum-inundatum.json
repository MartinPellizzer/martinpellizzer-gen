    "intro": "Colchicum inundatum, commonly known as the water colchicum, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, large, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a bulbous corm that serves as its storage organ. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
