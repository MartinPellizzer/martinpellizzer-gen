    "intro": "Cyclosorus pendens, commonly known as the hanging liverwort, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that often hang from the substrate. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures. It is typically found on rocks, tree trunks, or damp soil in temperate regions. Cyclosorus pendens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for small invertebrates."
