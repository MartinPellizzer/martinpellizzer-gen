    "intro": "Carex rigida var. bigelowii, commonly known as Bigelow's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves that are generally blue-green in color, with a dense, clump-forming growth habit. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, three-sided flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
