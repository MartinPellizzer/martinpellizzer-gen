    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 gigas, commonly known as the giant lady's slipper orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, featuring a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows to a height of 50 to 100 centimeters, with thick, fleshy rhizomes that help it survive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty but is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
