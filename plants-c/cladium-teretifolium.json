    "intro": "Cladium teretifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread across wetlands, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Cladium teretifolium plays a vital role in the ecological balance of marsh ecosystems."
