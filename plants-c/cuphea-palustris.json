    "intro": "Cuphea palustris, commonly known as swamp cuphea, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist soil. Cuphea palustris is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
