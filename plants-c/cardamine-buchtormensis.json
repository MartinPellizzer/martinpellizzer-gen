    "intro": "Cardamine buchtormensis, commonly known as the Buchtorm watercress, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and tiny white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forested areas. Its leaves are often submerged or partially submerged, adapted to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
