    "intro": "Cassebeeria tuberculifera, commonly known as the roughleaf cassia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, tuberculate (bump-like) structures on the leaf surface. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
