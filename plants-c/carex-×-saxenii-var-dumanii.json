    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 saxenii var. dumanii, commonly known as the Siberian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the colder regions of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along the edges of lakes and rivers. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of wetland habitats."
