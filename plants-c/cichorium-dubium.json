    "intro": "Cichorium dubium, commonly known as bitterleaf chicory, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and lettuces, and is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in salads or as a seasoning due to their slightly bitter taste. Cichorium dubium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
