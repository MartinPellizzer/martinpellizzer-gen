    "intro": "Cryptophila pudica, commonly known as the shy flower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that open only in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Cryptophila pudica is considered a vulnerable species."
