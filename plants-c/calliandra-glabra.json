    "intro": "Calliandra glabra, commonly known as the silky serpent tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage composed of numerous small, silky-haired leaves. The plant produces showy, bright red or orange flower clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Calliandra glabra is often used in ornamental gardening and for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil health."
