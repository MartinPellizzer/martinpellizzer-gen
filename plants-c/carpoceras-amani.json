    "intro": "Carpoceras amani, commonly known as the Amani orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Tanzania. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, pale green to yellowish flowers with intricate markings. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions with partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette near the ground. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Carpoceras amani is considered a conservation concern."
