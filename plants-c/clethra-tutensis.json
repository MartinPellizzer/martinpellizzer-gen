    "intro": "Clethra tutensis, commonly known as the Tuttle clethra, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture. Clethra tutensis is often found in moist, wooded habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological role."
