    "intro": "Chamelaucium floriferum subsp. diffusum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is well adapted to coastal environments and is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological value."
