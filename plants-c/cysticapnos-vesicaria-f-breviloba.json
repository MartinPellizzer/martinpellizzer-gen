    "intro": "Cysticapnos vesicaria f. breviloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bladderpod, is a variant of the bladderpod species native to the western United States. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features small, rounded leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring. Its capsule fruits are distinctive, containing several seeds enclosed in a bladder-like sac. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
