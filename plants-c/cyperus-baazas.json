It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, triangular stems and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its roots are often rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas. Cyperus baazas plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
