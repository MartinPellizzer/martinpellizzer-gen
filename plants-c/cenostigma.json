    "intro": "Cenostigma, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often characterized by their showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. They have alternate, simple leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. Cenostigma species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
