    "intro": "Cyperus angolensis, commonly known as the Angola sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Cyperus angolensis produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the ends of its stems. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
