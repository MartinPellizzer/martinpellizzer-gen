    "intro": "Coleosanthus cymuliferus, commonly known as the Christmas star, is a striking flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, star-shaped inflorescences that resemble a Christmas star, hence its common name. The plant produces vibrant, colorful bracts that range from red to orange and yellow, which are often mistaken for flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Coleosanthus cymuliferus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a potted plant."
