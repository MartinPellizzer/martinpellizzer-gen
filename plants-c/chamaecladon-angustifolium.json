    "intro": "Chamaecladon angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved chamaecladon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has finely divided, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. Its small white flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
