    "intro": "Cordia palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's cordia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small shrub or tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds."
