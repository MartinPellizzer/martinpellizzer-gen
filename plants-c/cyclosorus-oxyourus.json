    "intro": "Cyclosorus oxyourus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four parts, resembling a four-leaf clover. This plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight and nutrients. Its rhizomes spread across the water surface, anchoring it to submerged substrates. Cyclosorus oxyourus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
