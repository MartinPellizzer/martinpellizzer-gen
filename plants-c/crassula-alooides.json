It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, star-shaped flowers, usually in white or pale pink. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Crassula alooides is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
