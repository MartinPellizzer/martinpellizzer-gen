    "intro": "Calceolus reginae, commonly known as the imperial pansy, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of central Europe. It is characterized by its unique, hooded flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, with intricate patterns resembling the face of a queen. The plant grows in rocky, acidic soils and thrives in shaded, moist environments. It is a perennial herb that produces delicate, heart-shaped leaves and blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Calceolus reginae is considered endangered and is protected in many countries."
