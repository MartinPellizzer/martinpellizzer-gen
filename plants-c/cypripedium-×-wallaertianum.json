    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 wallaertianum, commonly known as the Wallaert's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
