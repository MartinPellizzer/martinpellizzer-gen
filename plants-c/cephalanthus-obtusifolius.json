    "intro": "Cephalanthus obtusifolius, commonly known as sweetshrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, glossy, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
