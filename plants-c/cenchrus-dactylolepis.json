    "intro": "Cenchrus dactylolepis, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in coastal areas and saline soils, making it a hardy and resilient species. Its fibrous roots contribute to soil stabilization, making it ecologically significant in coastal ecosystems."
