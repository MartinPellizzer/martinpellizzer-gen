    "intro": "Cyperus alternifolius var. flabelliformis, commonly known as the fan-leaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a fan-like pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an effective pioneer species in wetland ecosystems."
