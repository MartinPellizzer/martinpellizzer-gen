    "intro": "Cowiea, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Amaryllidaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries like Namibia and South Africa. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. Cowiea species are typically short-lived perennials, often growing from bulbs or corms that store water and nutrients. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall."
