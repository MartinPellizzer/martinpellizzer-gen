    "intro": "Cassia fenarolii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre cassia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well adapted to dry environments. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous pod and are dispersed by wind. Cassia fenarolii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
