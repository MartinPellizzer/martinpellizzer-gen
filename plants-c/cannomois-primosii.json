    "intro": "Cannomois primosii, commonly known as the golden spike fern, is a rare and striking member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that emit a faint golden hue under sunlight. Native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique morphology makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and private collections. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
