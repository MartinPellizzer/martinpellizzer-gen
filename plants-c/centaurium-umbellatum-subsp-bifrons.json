    "intro": "Centaurium umbellatum subsp. bifrons, commonly known as the bifrontal sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters and features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly wavy margin, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. This subspecies is distinguished by its two distinct faces on the flower petals, giving it its common name."
