    "intro": "Conomorpha bumelioides, commonly known as the whiteflower false holly, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a rough texture, while its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. Conomorpha bumelioides is often found in association with other understory plants in humid, temperate forests."
