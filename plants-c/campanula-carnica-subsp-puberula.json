    "intro": "Campanula carnica subsp. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a rough, pubescent texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting flowers."
