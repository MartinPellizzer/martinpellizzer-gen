    "intro": "Chaptalia, commonly known as the \"cup-of-joy\" or \"cup-of-sun,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their slender, often hairy stems and compound leaves that resemble those of carrots or parsley. The flowers are typically small and clustered in umbels, a common feature among members of the carrot family. Chaptalia species are native to regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where they thrive in high-altitude environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
