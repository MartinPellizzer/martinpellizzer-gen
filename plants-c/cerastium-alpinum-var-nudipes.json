    "intro": "Cerastium alpinum var. nudipes, commonly known as the naked-stem mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that are often leafless near the base. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh alpine environments. This variant is distinguished by its reduced foliage at the stem base, giving it a unique appearance compared to other Cerastium species."
