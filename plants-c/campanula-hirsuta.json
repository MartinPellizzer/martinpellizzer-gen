    "intro": "Campanula hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs. Campanula hirsuta is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
