    "intro": "Crocus sakaltutanensis, commonly known as the Sakaltutan crocus, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, often violet or white-colored petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period to trigger flowering. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
