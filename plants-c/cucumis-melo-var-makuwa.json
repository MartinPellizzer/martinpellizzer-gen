    "intro": "Cucumis melo var. makuwa, commonly known as the African horned melon, is a unique variant of the melon species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, spiky, green rind that resembles a hornet's nest, giving it its common name. The fruit contains a single, large, edible, yellow-orange pulp with a mild, slightly sweet flavor. It is typically harvested when the skin turns from green to a deeper, almost black color. This plant thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit."
