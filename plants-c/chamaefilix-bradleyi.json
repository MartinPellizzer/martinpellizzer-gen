    "intro": "Chamaefilix bradleyi, commonly known as the Bradley's rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Chamaefilix bradleyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
