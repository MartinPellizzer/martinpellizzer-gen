    "intro": "Coryphantha brevimamma, commonly known as the short-milked cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a small, spineless plant with a globular or cylindrical stem that often branches at the base. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the axils of the stems. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Coryphantha brevimamma is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
