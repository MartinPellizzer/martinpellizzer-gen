    "intro": "Carex muricata var. pairae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants commonly found in wet or moist environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly rough to the touch. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
