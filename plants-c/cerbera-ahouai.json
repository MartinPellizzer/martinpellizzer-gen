    "intro": "Cerbera ahouai, commonly known as the African snowball, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white, clustered flowers that resemble snowballs. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy texture, while its fruits are follicles that contain toxic seeds. Due to the presence of cardiac glycosides, it is considered poisonous and should be handled with care."
