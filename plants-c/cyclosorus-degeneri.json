    "intro": "Cyclosorus degeneri, commonly known as the degeneri's waterwheel, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of four floating leaves, each with a single central vein and a rounded, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures consist of small, floating fruits that contain spores, which are dispersed by water. Cyclosorus degeneri is often used in water gardens and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to help control algae growth."
