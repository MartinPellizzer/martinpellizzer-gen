    "intro": "Carduus nigrescens subsp. recurvatus, commonly known as the curly thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The subspecies recurvatus is distinguished by its more curled leaf margins compared to other varieties of Carduus nigrescens."
