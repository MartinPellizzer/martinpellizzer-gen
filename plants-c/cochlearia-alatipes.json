    "intro": "Cochlearia alatipes, commonly known as the winged cochlearia, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its unique feature is the presence of wing-like structures on its leaves, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Cochlearia alatipes is often found in open habitats such as tundra and mountain meadows."
