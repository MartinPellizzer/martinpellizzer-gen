    "intro": "Cimicifuga biternata, commonly known as black cohosh, is a perennial plant native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that bear large, compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in panicles. Its roots and rhizomes are the primary parts used in traditional medicine for their purported hormonal and anti-inflammatory properties. Cimicifuga biternata thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in rich, loamy soils."
