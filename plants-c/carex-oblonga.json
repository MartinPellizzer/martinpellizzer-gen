    "intro": "Carex oblonga, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly wider than those of true grasses. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered in a cylindrical inflorescence. Carex oblonga thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
