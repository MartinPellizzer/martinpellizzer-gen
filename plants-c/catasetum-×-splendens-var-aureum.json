    "intro": "Catasetum \u00d7 splendens var. aureum, commonly known as the golden Catasetum, is a hybrid orchid native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green foliage, which is often adorned with intricate patterns resembling veins. The plant produces fragrant, bee-pollinated flowers that are typically yellow or orange, with a unique structure that includes a specialized appendage called a galea. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
