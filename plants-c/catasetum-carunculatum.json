    "intro": "Catasetum carunculatum, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow pouch-like flowers that resemble a slipper, which is a distinctive feature among orchids. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of forests. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, particularly bees, due to the unique structure of its labellum. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces a fragrant, yellow or orange flower with a specialized column that aids in pollination."
