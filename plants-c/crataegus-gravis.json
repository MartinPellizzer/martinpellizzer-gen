    "intro": "Crataegus gravis, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves, and showy white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are typically eaten by birds and small mammals. Crataegus gravis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and as a hedgerow plant. It also has historical uses in herbal medicine for its cardiovascular benefits."
