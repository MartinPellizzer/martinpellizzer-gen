    "intro": "Cyrtomium chingianum, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its spore-bearing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cyrtomium chingianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and air-purifying qualities."
