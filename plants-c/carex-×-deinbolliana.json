    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 deinbolliana, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex brevicuspis and Carex comosa, characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically forms compact clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Carex \u00d7 deinbolliana is often found in wet or moist habitats, such as marshes and along stream banks."
