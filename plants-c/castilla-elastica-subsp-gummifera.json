It is a large shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its thick, woody stem and dense foliage. The plant is notable for its ability to produce a milky latex, which is harvested for commercial rubber production. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a glossy appearance. The flowers are small and clustered, producing yellowish-green blooms that attract various pollinators."
