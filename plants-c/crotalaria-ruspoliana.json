It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated, hairy pods that split open when mature to release the seeds. Crotalaria ruspoliana is often used in traditional medicine and is also grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance."
