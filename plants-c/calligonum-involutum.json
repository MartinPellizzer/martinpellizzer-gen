    "intro": "Calligonum involutum, commonly known as the curled spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub with dense, compact foliage that helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which reduces water loss and enhances drought tolerance. Calligonum involutum is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert landscapes."
