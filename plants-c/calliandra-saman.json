It is characterized by its feathery, pink or red flower clusters that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its showy flowers. The tree is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
