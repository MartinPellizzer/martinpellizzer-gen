    "intro": "Centella caespitosa, commonly known as Asiatic pennywort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily, forming dense patches in wet or moist environments. Centella caespitosa is often found in marshy areas, stream banks, and other waterlogged habitats."
