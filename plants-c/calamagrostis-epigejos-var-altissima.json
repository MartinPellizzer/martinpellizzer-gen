    "intro": "Calamagrostis epigejos var. altissima, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a tall, ornamental grass native to eastern North America. It features slender, silver-blue foliage that turns coppery in the fall, creating a striking visual display. The plant produces feathery, pale green to golden inflorescences that add texture and movement to the landscape. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its upright growth habit and fine texture make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and erosion control."
