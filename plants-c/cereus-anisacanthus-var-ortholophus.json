    "intro": "Cereus anisacanthus var. ortholophus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to bloom at night, producing large, fragrant white flowers. The plant has a succulent structure, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in arid environments. Its flowers typically open in the evening and remain open for only one night before closing in the morning. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal flowering habit."
