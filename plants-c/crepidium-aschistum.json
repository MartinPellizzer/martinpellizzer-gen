    "intro": "Crepidium aschistum, commonly known as the aschistum orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions. Crepidium aschistum is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, where it thrives in cool, humid climates."
