    "intro": "Canarium australianum var. australianum, commonly known as the Australian candlenut, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and has smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, with a glossy upper surface and a pale underside. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in coastal and subtropical regions."
