    "intro": "Cassipourea calimensis, commonly known as the Calimen's cassipourea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the Philippines, specifically the island of Mindanao, where it grows in lowland and montane rainforests. The plant is a small shrub characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cassipourea calimensis is considered a rare and poorly understood species."
