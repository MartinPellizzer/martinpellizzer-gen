    "intro": "Cedrus atlantica columnaris-erecta, commonly known as the Atlas cedar, is a variety of the Atlas cedar tree native to the mountainous regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, columnar growth habit and erect branches, forming a tall, conical shape. The tree produces scale-like leaves that are dark green and dense, providing a lush canopy. Its cones are woody and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural propagation. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique form and evergreen foliage."
