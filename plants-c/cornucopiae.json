    "intro": "Cornucopiae, commonly known as the horn of plenty, is a symbolic plant often associated with abundance and prosperity. It is not a real botanical species but rather a symbolic representation used in art and literature. The imagery of the cornucopia typically features a curved horn filled with fruits, grains, and flowers, symbolizing a bountiful harvest. In some mythological contexts, it is said to have originated from the horn of the goat Amalthea, who nursed the infant Zeus. While not a real plant, its visual elements draw inspiration from various real flora, including grapes, figs, and wheat."
