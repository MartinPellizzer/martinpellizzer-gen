    "intro": "Crataegus arcuata, commonly known as the red thornapple or red hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate to elliptic leaves, and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and mammals but toxic to humans. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodlands, thickets, and along stream banks. Crataegus arcuata plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for wildlife."
