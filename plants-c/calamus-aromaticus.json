    "intro": "Calamus aromaticus, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshes in Asia and North America. It features long, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic, emitting a pleasant, spicy scent. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are typically submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. Calamus aromaticus thrives in shallow water and is often found in association with other wetland plants."
