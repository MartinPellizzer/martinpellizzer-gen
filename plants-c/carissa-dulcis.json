    "intro": "Carissa dulcis, commonly known as the yellow bell tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant's leaves are glossy and oval-shaped, providing a dense canopy that supports various wildlife species. Its fruit, a small, yellow, fleshy berry, is edible but has a bitter taste when raw. Carissa dulcis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
