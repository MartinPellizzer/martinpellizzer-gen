    "intro": "Chenopodium album var. paganum, commonly known as common lambsquarters, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by dry, three-angled seed capsules. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, gardens, and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
