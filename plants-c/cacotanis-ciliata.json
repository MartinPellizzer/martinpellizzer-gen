    "intro": "Cacotanis ciliata, commonly known as the hairy leaf cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America. It features a cylindrical stem covered in soft, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which provide protection from herbivores. Cacotanis ciliata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
