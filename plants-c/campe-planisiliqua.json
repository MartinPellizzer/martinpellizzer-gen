    "intro": "Campe planisiliqua, commonly known as the flat-leafed marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted for water retention. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, blooming in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in marshy areas. Campe planisiliqua plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
