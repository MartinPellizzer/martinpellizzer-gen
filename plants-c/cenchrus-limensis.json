    "intro": "Cenchrus limensis, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and can withstand saline conditions, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its growth habit helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its native habitat."
