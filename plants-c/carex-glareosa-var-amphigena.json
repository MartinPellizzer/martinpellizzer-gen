It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, bogs, and along the edges of streams. The plant features grass-like leaves that are often dark green and slightly glossy, with a dense rosette structure. Its flowering spikes are usually pale green to brown, and the plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
