    "intro": "Caladium simplex, commonly known as the arrowhead vine, is a tropical perennial plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with striking red or purple veins. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by green, oval-shaped berries. Caladium simplex is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers."
