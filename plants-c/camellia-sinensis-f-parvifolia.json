    "intro": "Camellia sinensis f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved tea plant, is a compact variant of the Camellia sinensis species. It is characterized by its smaller, more delicate leaves compared to the standard Camellia sinensis. This form is native to China and is often cultivated for its unique flavor profile in specialty teas. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Its ornamental value and tea-producing potential make it a prized plant in both horticulture and the tea industry."
