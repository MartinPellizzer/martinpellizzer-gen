    "intro": "Crataegus grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and showy white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are typically harvested in the fall. Crataegus grandiflorus is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, thriving in a variety of soil types. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects."
