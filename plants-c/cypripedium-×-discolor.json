    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 discolor, commonly known as the hybrid yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow pouch-shaped flower with a distinctive greenish throat and dark red veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are broad and leathery, often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
