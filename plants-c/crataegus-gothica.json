    "intro": "Crataegus gothica, commonly known as the Gothic hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 8 meters, featuring thorny branches and dense foliage of oval, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called pomes. Its botanical characteristics include simple, alternate leaves and a woody, often branched structure. Crataegus gothica is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and other sunny to partially shaded habitats."
