    "intro": "Centaurea maculosa subsp. muretii, commonly known as the spotted knapweed, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking purple to pink flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It has a taproot system and can spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
