    "intro": "Cyathea inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its fronds are dimorphic, with sterile and fertile leaves that contribute to its distinctive appearance. Cyathea inaequalis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
