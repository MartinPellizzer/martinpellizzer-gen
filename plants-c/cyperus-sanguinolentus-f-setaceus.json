    "intro": "Cyperus sanguinolentus f. setaceus, commonly known as the red-flowered flatsedge, is a botanical variant of the Cyperus sanguinolentus species. It is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae, characterized by its striking red or pinkish flower spikes. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along water edges, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with the inflorescence consisting of dense, spike-like clusters. This ornamental grass is sometimes cultivated for its visual appeal in wetland gardens and can also serve as an indicator species for water quality."
