    "intro": "Catopsis mosenii, commonly known as the Mosenii air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, which is used to collect rainwater for hydration. The plant is adapted to grow on trees and other surfaces, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a fine, powdery coating that aids in water retention. Catopsis mosenii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
