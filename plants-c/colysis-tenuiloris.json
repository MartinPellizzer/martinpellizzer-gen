    "intro": "Colysis tenuiloris, commonly known as the slender leaf colysis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, typically clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to habitat loss, Colysis tenuiloris is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
