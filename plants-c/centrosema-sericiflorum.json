    "intro": "Centrosema sericiflorum, commonly known as silkyflower centrosema, is a perennial leguminous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in ecological restoration and agricultural settings. The silky, hairy texture of its flowers gives it its common name and contributes to its ornamental appeal."
