It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often bright green and slightly hairy. It produces showy, pink to red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. Coccoloba latifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking foliage and vibrant, long-lasting bracts."
