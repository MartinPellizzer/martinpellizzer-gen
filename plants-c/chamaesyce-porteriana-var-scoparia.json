    "intro": "Chamaesyce porteriana var. scoparia, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It typically features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, often in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to minimize surface area and conserve moisture. This species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
