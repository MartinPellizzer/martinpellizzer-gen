    "intro": "Cochlidium seminudum, commonly known as the naked-slimy snail, is a small terrestrial gastropod mollusk native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Achatinidae and is characterized by its smooth, glossy shell that is often nearly invisible, giving it its common name. The species is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as under leaves or in leaf litter. Its diet consists mainly of decaying plant matter, contributing to nutrient cycling in its habitat. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is not widely studied, but it plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
