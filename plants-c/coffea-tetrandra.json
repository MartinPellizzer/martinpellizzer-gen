    "intro": "Coffea tetrandra, commonly known as the Liberian coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to West Africa, particularly Liberia, and grows as an evergreen shrub. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into red, fleshy fruits containing the coffee seeds. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a glossy surface. While it is not widely cultivated for commercial coffee production, it is valued for its unique flavor profile and ecological significance in its native habitat."
