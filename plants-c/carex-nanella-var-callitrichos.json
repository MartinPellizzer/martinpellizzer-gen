    "intro": "Carex nanella var. callitrichos, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green and arranged in a dense, compact rosette. Its inflorescence consists of a single, cylindrical spike that bears small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
