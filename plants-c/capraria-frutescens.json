    "intro": "Capraria frutescens, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, blooming throughout the cooler months. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often sprawling. Capraria frutescens is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
