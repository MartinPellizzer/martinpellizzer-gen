    "intro": "Crocus pholegandrius, commonly known as the Persian crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to cold climates, often growing at high altitudes. Its bulbs are relatively small and contain the plant's stored nutrients. The Persian crocus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
