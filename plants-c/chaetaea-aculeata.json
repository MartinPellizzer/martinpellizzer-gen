    "intro": "Chaetaea aculeata, commonly known as the prickly morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some areas."
