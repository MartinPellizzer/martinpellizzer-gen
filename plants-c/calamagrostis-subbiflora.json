It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or pink. It has a clump-forming growth habit and is often found in wetland ecosystems. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland restoration and ecological studies."
