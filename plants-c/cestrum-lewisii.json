    "intro": "Cestrum lewisii, commonly known as Lewis's cestrum, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 feet, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are pollinated primarily by moths and bats, making it an important plant in nocturnal ecosystems. Cestrum lewisii is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty and scent."
