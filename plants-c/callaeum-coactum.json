    "intro": "Callaeum coactum, commonly known as the false mallow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Callaeum coactum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported soothing properties."
