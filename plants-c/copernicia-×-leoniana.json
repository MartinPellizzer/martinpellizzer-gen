    "intro": "Copernicia \u00d7 leoniana, commonly known as the hybrid copernicia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, coconut-like fruits. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, warm climates. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Copernicia cerifera and Copernicia melonae."
