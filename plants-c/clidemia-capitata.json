    "intro": "Clidemia capitata, commonly known as the Hawaiian false nettle, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests. Clidemia capitata is an important component of Hawaii's native flora, though it is also considered an invasive species in some regions."
