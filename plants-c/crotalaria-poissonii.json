    "intro": "Crotalaria poissonii, commonly known as the African crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its erect growth habit and palmately compound leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy, elongated pods that split open when mature to disperse the seeds. Crotalaria poissonii is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
