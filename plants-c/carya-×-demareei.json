    "intro": "Carya \u00d7 demareei, commonly known as the Nuttall hickory, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Carya cordiformis (butternut) and Carya ovata (shagbark hickory). It is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States, characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which are typically harvested in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas, contributing to local biodiversity."
