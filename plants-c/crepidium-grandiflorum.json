    "intro": "Crepidium grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with numerous white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, while its leaves are narrow and grass-like. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in aquatic gardens and bog environments."
