    "intro": "Colchicum latifolium var. longistylum, commonly known as the broadleaf colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a bulbous corm, which serves as its primary storage organ and enables it to survive in dry conditions. It thrives in rocky or open woodland habitats and is often found in high elevation areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and protected areas."
