    "intro": "Clematis cirrhosa f. balearica, commonly known as the Balearic Clematis, is a compact shrub-like plant native to the Balearic Islands. It features arching stems covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it a distinctive, almost feathery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers with a subtle blueish tinge, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets that are narrow and serrated. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens."
