    "intro": "Coryphantha schwarziana, commonly known as the Schwarz's coryphantha, is a species of flowering plant in the Cactaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has spines that provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss. It is well adapted to desert environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in low-water conditions."
