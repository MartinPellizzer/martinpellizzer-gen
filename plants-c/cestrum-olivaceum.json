It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, elliptic leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun to partial shade. The silver trumpet bush is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its showy blooms and evergreen foliage."
