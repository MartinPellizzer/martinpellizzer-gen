    "intro": "Cycnoches thurstoniorum, commonly known as the Thurston's cycnoches, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that exhibit a unique coloration pattern, typically featuring a combination of white and purple hues. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees or in rocky crevices. Its reproductive cycle is closely tied to specific pollinators, making it highly dependent on ecological balance. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
