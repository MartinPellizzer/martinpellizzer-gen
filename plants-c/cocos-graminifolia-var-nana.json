    "intro": "Cocos graminifolia var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf palm or miniature coconut palm, is a compact, low-growing variant of the coconut palm. It features a slender, unbranched trunk with a fibrous sheath and small, clustered leaves that are fan-shaped and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into drupes resembling miniature coconuts. It is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas or disturbed soils. Due to its compact size, it is popular as an ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes."
