    "intro": "Chenopodium foliosum var. minus, commonly known as narrowleaf goosefoot, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open areas, such as fields and roadsides. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces tiny, dry fruits known as utricles. This species is often used in ecological restoration due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
