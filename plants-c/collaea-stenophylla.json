    "intro": "Collaea stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rockheath, is a perennial shrub native to the southern regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
