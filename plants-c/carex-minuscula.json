It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along stream banks. Carex minuscula is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
