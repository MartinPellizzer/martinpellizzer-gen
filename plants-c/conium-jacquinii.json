    "intro": "Conium jacquinii, commonly known as poison hemlock, is a toxic flowering plant belonging to the carrot family (Apiaceae). It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, particularly coniine, which can be lethal to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
