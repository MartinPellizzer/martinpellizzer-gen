    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis pseudomyrsinifolia, commonly known as the Chinese ironwood, is a member of the Fagaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its dense, hard wood and broad, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits that are important for wildlife. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
