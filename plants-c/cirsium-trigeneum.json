It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in summer. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, typical of the daisy family. Cirsium trigeneum is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
