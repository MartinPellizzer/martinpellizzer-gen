    "intro": "Caucalis aspersa, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant features slender, hairy stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Caucalis aspersa is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
