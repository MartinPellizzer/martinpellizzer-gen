    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 radiosum, commonly known as the hybrid white lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a hybrid between Cypripedium yunnanense and Cypripedium calceolus, exhibiting a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant produces large, showy flowers with a white pouch-like lip and yellowish sepals, making it highly ornamental. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
