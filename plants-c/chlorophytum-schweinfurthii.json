It features a rhizomatous stem system that allows it to spread and form dense clumps. The plant produces long, narrow leaves with distinctive white or yellow markings that resemble teeth, giving it its common name. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
