    "intro": "Campanula tarana, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Campanula tarana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
