    "intro": "Calophyllum changii, commonly known as the Malayan yellowwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown to black bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by woody, orange-red fruits containing single seeds. Calophyllum changii is valued for its hard, durable wood used in furniture and construction. It also plays an important role in traditional medicine and ecological systems in its native habitat."
