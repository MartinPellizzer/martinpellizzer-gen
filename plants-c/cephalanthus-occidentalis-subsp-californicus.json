    "intro": "Cephalanthus occidentalis subsp. californicus, commonly known as the California sweetshrub, is a shrub native to California and parts of Oregon. It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown bark and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces dark purple, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife but not for humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas and woodlands. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local fauna."
