    "intro": "Carex ptychocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. Native to North America, it thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and swamps. The plant has small, wind-pollinated flowers and produces dark brown, triangular seeds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments."
