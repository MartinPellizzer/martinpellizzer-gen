    "intro": "Chorizema parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered chorizema, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. The plant is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
