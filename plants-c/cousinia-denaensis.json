    "intro": "Cousinia denaensis, commonly known as the Denaensis cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, silver-gray leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. It produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cousinia denaensis is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cold, dry conditions."
