It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinct basal rosette structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, clustered flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along water bodies. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
