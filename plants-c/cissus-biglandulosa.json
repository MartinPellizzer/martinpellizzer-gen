    "intro": "Cissus biglandulosa, commonly known as the African stone plant, is a member of the Vitaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a climbing vine characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by round, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. Its succulent leaves and stems allow it to store water, making it drought-tolerant. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
