    "intro": "Coilonox scabrocostatum, commonly known as the rough-costed orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant has distinctive, hairy leaves and possesses a unique root system adapted to its harsh, mountainous environment. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found growing in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coilonox scabrocostatum is considered a species of conservation concern."
