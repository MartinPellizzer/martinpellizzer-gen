    "intro": "Ceropegia discreta, commonly known as the \"Lion's Tail,\" is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces specialized structures called \"nectar glands\" that attract specific pollinators, such as moths and flies. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Ceropegia discreta is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and ease of care."
