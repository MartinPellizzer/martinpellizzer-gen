It is characterized by its dark green, cylindrical leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear brownish-purple flowers. This variety is noted for its slender, branching form, which distinguishes it from other Carex species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and shaded woodlands. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
