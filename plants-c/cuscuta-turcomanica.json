    "intro": "Cuscuta turcomanica, commonly known as the Turkmenian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to Central Asia and is often found growing on agricultural crops such as wheat and barley. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread efficiently across different regions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops, making it a challenge for farmers."
