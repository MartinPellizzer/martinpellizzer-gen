It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and similar plants. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in three rows, characteristic of many sedges. It produces small, three-bracted spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of its flowering stems. Carex subphysodes thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
