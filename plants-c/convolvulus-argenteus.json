    "intro": "Convolvulus argenteus, commonly known as silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine silvery down. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Convolvulus argenteus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant."
