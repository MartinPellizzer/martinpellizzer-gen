    "intro": "Conchochilus distichus, commonly known as the two-ranked conch shell fern, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged fronds that resemble the coiled structure of a conch shell. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a leathery texture and a deep green color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
