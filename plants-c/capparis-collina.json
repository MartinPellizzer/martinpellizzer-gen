    "intro": "Capparis collina, commonly known as the coastal caper, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by bright red or orange fruits. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly waxy texture. Capparis collina is adapted to salt spray and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
