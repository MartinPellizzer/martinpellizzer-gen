It features a sympodial growth habit with a short, horizontal rhizome and dense, fleshy roots. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth."
