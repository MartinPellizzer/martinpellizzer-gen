    "intro": "Crocus brachyfilus, commonly known as the short-stemmed crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters and features lance-shaped leaves that are basal and grass-like. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with six petals, which bloom in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in dry, well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Crocus brachyfilus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
