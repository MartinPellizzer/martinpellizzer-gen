    "intro": "Cavendishia revoluta, commonly known as the velvetleaf cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and dense clusters of small, waxy leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, adding visual interest to its appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
