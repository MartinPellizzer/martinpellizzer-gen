    "intro": "Cucumis africanus var. myriocarpus, commonly known as the African horned cucumber, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It produces large, spiny, and often ribbed fruits that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and is typically found in moist, shaded habitats. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blooms, and it relies on insects for pollination. The fruit is edible when young but becomes bitter and fibrous as it matures."
