    "intro": "Cyperus taitensis, commonly known as the Taiti flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Cyperus taitensis produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often surrounded by bracts. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystems."
