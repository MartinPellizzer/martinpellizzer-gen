    "intro": "Cocculus carolinianus, commonly known as the Carolina cocculus, is a member of the Fabaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a climbing vine that produces distinctive, warty, egg-shaped fruits that turn from green to yellowish as they mature. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small, clustered, and typically white or pale green, with a unique, spurred structure. The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical properties remain largely understudied."
