    "intro": "Carpha alpina var. schoenoides, commonly known as alpine flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and ability to withstand cold climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
