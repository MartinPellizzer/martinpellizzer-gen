    "intro": "Cinnamomum nicolsonianum, commonly known as the Kew tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the island of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by egg-shaped, red berries. The tree is valued for its aromatic bark, which contains essential oils and has been used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
