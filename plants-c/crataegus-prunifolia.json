    "intro": "Crataegus prunifolia, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are a food source for birds and wildlife. Crataegus prunifolia is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, and it has been used in traditional medicine for its potential cardiovascular benefits."
