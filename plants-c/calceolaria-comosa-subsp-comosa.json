It is characterized by its distinctive, slipper-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored, ranging from red to orange. The plant has fuzzy, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral structure."
