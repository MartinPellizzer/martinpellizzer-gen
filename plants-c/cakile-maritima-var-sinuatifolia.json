    "intro": "Cakile maritima var. sinuatifolia, commonly known as the sinuous sea rocket, is a coastal plant adapted to harsh maritime environments. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in spring, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in regions with high salinity and wind exposure. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
