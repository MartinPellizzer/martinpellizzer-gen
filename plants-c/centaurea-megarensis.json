It is characterized by its spiny, upright growth habit and produces vibrant purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to sunny environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Centaurea megarensis is often found in coastal areas and is considered a valuable plant for ecological studies due to its unique adaptations."
