    "intro": "Carex crawfordii f. vigens, commonly known as the vigorous sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikes of small, greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to the eastern United States, this sedge thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a valuable plant for erosion control. The plant is also appreciated for its ornamental value in gardens with wet or boggy conditions."
