    "intro": "Castilleja fissifolia subvar. hispidior, commonly known as the hairy leaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red-orange bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant has a slender, branched stem and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its roots form haustoria, which attach to the roots of host plants to extract nutrients. This subspecies is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
