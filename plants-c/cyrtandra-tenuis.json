    "intro": "Cyrtandra tenuis, commonly known as the slender cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, including Hawaii and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract various pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Cyrtandra tenuis is often found in moist, shaded habitats like rainforests and stream banks, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for cultivation in tropical gardens."
