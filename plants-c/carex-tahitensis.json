    "intro": "Carex tahitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, including Tahiti and other islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils near freshwater sources such as streams and wetlands. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated. Carex tahitensis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates."
