    "intro": "Cheilanthes monticola, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically gray-green in color and covered with a dense layer of rhizomes. This plant is native to the high elevations of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The fronds are pinnately divided and often form a dense, cushion-like growth pattern. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh mountainous conditions."
