    "intro": "Crepidiastrum diversifolium, commonly known as the variable-leaf stiltroot, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that vary in shape and size along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are fibrous and often form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in wetland environments. Crepidiastrum diversifolium is typically found in moist, acidic soils near streams and in swampy areas."
