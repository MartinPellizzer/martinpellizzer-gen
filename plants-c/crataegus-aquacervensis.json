    "intro": "Crataegus aquacervensis, commonly known as the aquatic hawthorn, is a rare and unique species of shrub or small tree native to specific wetland habitats. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils makes it an important component of riparian ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Crataegus aquacervensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
