    "intro": "Couthovia seemannii, commonly known as the golden sun orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a unique, sun-like appearance that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers bloom during the dry season, making it a notable species in the orchid family. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Couthovia seemannii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
