    "intro": "Cleistocactus chacoanus, commonly known as the Chacoan globose cactus, is a species native to northern Argentina and southern Bolivia. It is a low-growing, globular cactus with a short, thick stem and sparse, spiny areoles. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, a characteristic of its nocturnal flowering habit. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The species is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat."
