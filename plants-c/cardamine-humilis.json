It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a heart-shaped base and small, yellowish flowers that appear in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Botanically, it belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy flowers and often toxic sap."
