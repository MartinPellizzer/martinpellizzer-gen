    "intro": "Callitriche autumnalis f. platyphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf water starwort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant features small, floating or submergent leaves that are broad and oval in shape, often with a waxy surface. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and borne in clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
