    "intro": "Carex stricta var. strictior, commonly known as narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that grow upright and are often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish to brownish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
