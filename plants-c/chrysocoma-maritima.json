    "intro": "Chrysocoma maritima, commonly known as the coastal chrysocoma, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid coastal conditions. Chrysocoma maritima is often used in local traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
