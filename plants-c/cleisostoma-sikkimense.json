    "intro": "Cleisostoma sikkimense, commonly known as the Sikkim cleistostoma, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has linear, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its mountainous habitat. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
