    "intro": "Cypripedium froschii, commonly known as the Frosch's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a pinkish-red lip with intricate patterns. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread slowly over time. Its leaves are ovate and arranged in a basal rosette, often with a waxy coating. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several regions."
