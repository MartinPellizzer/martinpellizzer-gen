    "intro": "Carex ptychocarpa var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf basket sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies. This variety is distinguished by its larger, broader leaves compared to other Carex species."
