    "intro": "Cardamine stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf watercress, is a perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features small, alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in wet soils, often found along streams and in forest understories. The species is valued for its peppery flavor and is sometimes used in culinary applications."
