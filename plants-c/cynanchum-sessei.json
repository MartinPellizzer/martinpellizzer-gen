    "intro": "Cynanchum sessei, commonly known as the Chinese milkweed or wild ginseng, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which contains various alkaloids. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellowish-green with a distinctive crown of lobes. Cynanchum sessei is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its use is limited due to its toxic properties."
