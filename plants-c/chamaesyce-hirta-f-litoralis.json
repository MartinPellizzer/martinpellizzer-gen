    "intro": "Chamaesyce hirta f. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. The plant has small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
