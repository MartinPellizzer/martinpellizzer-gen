    "intro": "Commiphora fischeri, commonly known as Fischer's myrrh, is a small evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes other resin-producing plants like frankincense and myrrh. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and produces a fragrant, reddish-brown resin from its bark and leaves. This resin has been used traditionally for its medicinal and aromatic properties. Its ability to thrive in harsh environments makes it an important component of its native ecosystems."
