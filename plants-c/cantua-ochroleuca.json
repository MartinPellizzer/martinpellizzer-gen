    "intro": "Cantua ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow-flowered cantua, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and showy flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically broad and have a slightly hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its native arid environment. Cantua ochroleuca is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
