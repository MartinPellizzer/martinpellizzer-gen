    "intro": "Cicerbita aitchisoniana, commonly known as the Aitchison's cicerbita, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Pakistan. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and its leaves are usually hairy and alternate along the stem. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range."
