    "intro": "Cyanea kauaulaensis, commonly known as the Kaua\u02bbula sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in coastal habitats, such as sandy shores and rocky areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Cyanea kauaulaensis is known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds, making it well adapted to its marine environment. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected under Hawaiian conservation efforts."
