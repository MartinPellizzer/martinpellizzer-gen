    "intro": "Cerasus hyemalis, commonly known as the winter cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, red, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to cherries but are typically less sweet. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for cooler climates. Due to its ornamental value and early bloom, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
