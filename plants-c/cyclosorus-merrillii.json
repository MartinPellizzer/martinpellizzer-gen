    "intro": "Cyclosorus merrillii, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its fronds. Cyclosorus merrillii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
