    "intro": "Cereus phyllanthoides var. curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of pale yellow flowers that open at night. The plant has a cylindrical shape with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. Its foliage consists of modified leaves that are small and often obscured by the spines. This variety is well adapted to desert conditions, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water."
