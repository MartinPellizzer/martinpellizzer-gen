It is characterized by its intricate floral structures and vibrant coloration, typical of many orchid species. The plant exhibits a complex morphology with specialized floral parts adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its growth habit is usually epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other plants without being parasitic. This hybrid is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its genetic diversity and ornamental value."
