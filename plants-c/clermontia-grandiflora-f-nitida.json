    "intro": "Clermontia grandiflora f. nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf clermontia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its silver-gray, velvety foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
