    "intro": "Coccoloba filipes, commonly known as the mangrove fern, is a tropical plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that grow from a creeping rhizome. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove swamps and tidal flats. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a smooth, waxy surface to reduce water loss. Coccoloba filipes plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
