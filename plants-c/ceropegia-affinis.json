    "intro": "Ceropegia affinis, commonly known as the African violet or string of hearts, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent species with fleshy, tuberous roots and thin, trailing stems that produce heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, which are adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Ceropegia affinis is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
