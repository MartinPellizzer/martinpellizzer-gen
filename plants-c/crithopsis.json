    "intro": "Crithopsis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and succulent, sometimes hairy leaves. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and rocky soils, where they thrive in saline or well-drained conditions. Crithopsis species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their unique appearance and hardiness. They produce small, wind-pollinated flowers and have a compact growth habit."
