    "intro": "Chamaecrista deserti, commonly known as the desert shrub or desert cassia, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Chamaecrista deserti also serves as a food source for various insects and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
