    "intro": "Cupressus lusitanica var. chlorocarpa, commonly known as the Portuguese cypress, is a variant of the narrow-leaved cypress. It is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Iberian Peninsula, characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and dark green foliage. The leaves are scale-like and tightly pressed against the branches, giving the tree a compact appearance. It produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and the tree is known for its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
