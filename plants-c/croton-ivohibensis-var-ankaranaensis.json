    "intro": "Croton ivohibensis var. ankaranaensis, commonly known as the Ankarana croton, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Ankarana Reserve in Madagascar. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky, limestone-rich soils, adapting to the unique geological conditions of its habitat. The plant features distinctive, palmate leaves with a velvety texture and a range of colors from green to reddish-brown. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange or red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered vulnerable to environmental threats."
