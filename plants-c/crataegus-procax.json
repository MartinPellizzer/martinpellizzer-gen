    "intro": "Crataegus procax, commonly known as the Florida hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet and features thorned branches, which are a characteristic feature of many hawthorn species. The plant produces white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges, and are arranged alternately along the stems. Crataegus procax is often found in moist, sandy soils and is commonly used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
