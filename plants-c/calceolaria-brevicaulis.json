It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive calyx-like petals that resemble small slippers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Its flowers are usually pale purple or white, with a unique shape that aids in pollination by specific insects. Calceolaria brevicaulis is appreciated for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
