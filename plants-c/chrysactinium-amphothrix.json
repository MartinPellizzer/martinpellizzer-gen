    "intro": "Chrysactinium amphothrix, commonly known as the golden thread orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow to golden flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing in shaded forest understories. Its flowers are typically clustered in loose racemes, and it is known for its ornamental value in horticulture. Due to habitat loss, Chrysactinium amphothrix is considered endangered in many parts of its native range."
