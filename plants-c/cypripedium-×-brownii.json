    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 brownii, commonly known as the Brown's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pinkish-brown coloration. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, forming a pseudobulb with a single leaf and a single flower spike. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, typical of its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
