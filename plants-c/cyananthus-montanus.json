    "intro": "Cyananthus montanus, commonly known as the alpine bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a glossy surface that helps retain moisture. Cyananthus montanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
