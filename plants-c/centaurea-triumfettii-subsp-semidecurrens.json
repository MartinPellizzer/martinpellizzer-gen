    "intro": "Centaurea triumfettii subsp. semidecurrens, commonly known as the creeping cornflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features upright, branching stems that often lie prostrate, forming dense mats. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers with yellow centers, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, disturbed areas, and along roadsides."
