    "intro": "Cerastium ceretanum, commonly known as the creeping snowbell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its frost-resistant nature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
