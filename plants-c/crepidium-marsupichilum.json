    "intro": "Crepidium marsupichilum, commonly known as the Marsupial Orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or rocky habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short rhizome system. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
