    "intro": "Chenopodium album var. stevensii, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is a variant of the common lambsquarters. It is an annual herb native to North America, characterized by its rough, spiny leaves and small greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and agricultural fields, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and adaptability. The plant contains oxalic acid, which can be harmful if ingested in large quantities."
