    "intro": "Circaea \u00d7 alpestris, commonly known as the alpine chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and oval, toothed leaves that are typically covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky slopes and woodland edges. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
