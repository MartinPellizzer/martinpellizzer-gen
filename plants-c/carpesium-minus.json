    "intro": "Carpesium minus, commonly known as lesser cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. Its fruit is a spiny, burr-like structure that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, contributing to its role in supporting pollinators."
