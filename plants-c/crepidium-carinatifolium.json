    "intro": "Crepidium carinatifolium, commonly known as the ridge-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, linear leaves with a distinct central ridge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose raceme, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
