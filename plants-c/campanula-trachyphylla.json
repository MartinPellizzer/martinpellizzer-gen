    "intro": "Campanula trachyphylla, commonly known as the rough bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple. The leaves are typically grayish-green with a rough, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
