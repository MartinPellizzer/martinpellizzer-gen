    "intro": "Cyperus tenax var. sabulicola, commonly known as sand flats sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal and sandy environments. It typically grows in wet or brackish habitats, such as marshes, tidal flats, and salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to greenish flowers. It is adapted to tolerate saline and waterlogged conditions, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize sandy soils, contributing to erosion control."
