    "intro": "Cunonia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf cunonia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Cunonia macrophylla is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
