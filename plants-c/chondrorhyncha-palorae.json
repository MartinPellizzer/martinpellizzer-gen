    "intro": "Chondrorhyncha palorae, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wet tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat destruction and its elusive nature, Chondrorhyncha palorae is considered critically endangered."
