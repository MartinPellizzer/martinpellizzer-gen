    "intro": "Carex prainii, commonly known as Prain's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
