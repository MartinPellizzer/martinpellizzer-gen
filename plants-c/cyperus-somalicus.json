    "intro": "Cyperus somalicus, commonly known as the Somali flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedge plants characterized by their triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Cyperus somalicus is often found in disturbed areas and can serve as a pioneer species in ecological succession."
