    "intro": "Coryanthes speciosa f. punctata, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with intricate patterns and a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of wasps, which are attracted by the scent and color of the blooms. The varietal name 'punctata' refers to the speckled or dotted appearance of its petals, adding to its ornamental value."
