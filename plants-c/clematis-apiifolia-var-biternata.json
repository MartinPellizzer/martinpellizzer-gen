    "intro": "Clematis apiifolia var. biternata, commonly known as the three-leaved Clematis, is a climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three broad, heart-shaped leaflets, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple. Its stems are woody and twining, allowing it to climb and cover trellises or fences. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
