    "intro": "Consolea spinosissima, commonly known as the spiny consolea, is a striking epiphytic cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in sharp, spiny tubercles. The plant produces clusters of vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with well-draining soil. It is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
