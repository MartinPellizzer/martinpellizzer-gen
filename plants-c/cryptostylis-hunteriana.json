    "intro": "Cryptostylis hunteriana, commonly known as the Hunter's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its elongated, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly shapes, giving it its common name. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears a cluster of flowers, which are often described as resembling elongated, ghostly faces. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Cryptostylis hunteriana is considered an endangered species."
