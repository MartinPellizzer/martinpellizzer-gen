    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 zayrae, commonly known as the Zayrae Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its vibrant, fragrant flowers. It originates from a cross between Cattleya mossiae and Cattleya trianae, resulting in a plant with striking purple and white petals. This orchid typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its native habitat of Central and South America. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. The flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a dramatic flair to any collection."
