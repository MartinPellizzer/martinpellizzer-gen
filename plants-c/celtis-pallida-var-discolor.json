It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow margins. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, spherical fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
