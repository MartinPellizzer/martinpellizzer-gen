    "intro": "Carex longispicata, commonly known as the long-spiked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Carex longispicata typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
