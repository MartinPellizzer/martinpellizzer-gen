    "intro": "Clematis terniflora var. denticulata, commonly known as the toothed clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often with serrated or toothed edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale blue flowers in the spring. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a climbing plant in gardens."
