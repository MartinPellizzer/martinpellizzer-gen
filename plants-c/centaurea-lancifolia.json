    "intro": "Centaurea lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved coneflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, spiky purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny environments. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. Centaurea lancifolia is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
