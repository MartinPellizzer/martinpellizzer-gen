    "intro": "Coelogyne glandulosa var. sathyanarayanae, commonly known as the Sathyanarayana's orchid, is a rare and ornamental orchid species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant features a pseudobulb system with fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its tropical and semi-arid habitat. Its flowers are typically borne on racemose inflorescences, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
