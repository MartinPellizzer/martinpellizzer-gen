    "intro": "Cespedesia discolor, commonly known as silver blade, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray blades that are resistant to drought and salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal and arid environments. The plant typically grows in dense clumps, with a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. Its foliage is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements. Cespedesia discolor is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its tolerance to frequent mowing."
