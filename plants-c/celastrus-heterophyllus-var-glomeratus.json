    "intro": "Celastrus heterophyllus var. glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered-leaf bittersweet, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often clustered leaves that vary in shape along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into bright orange or red berries, which are a key feature in its ecological role. Its berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The plant is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
