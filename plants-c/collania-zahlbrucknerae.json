    "intro": "Collania zahlbrucknerae, commonly known as the Zahlsbruckner's collania, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in the undergrowth. Its botanical features include lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
