    "intro": "Campanula chondrophylla, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Campanula chondrophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
