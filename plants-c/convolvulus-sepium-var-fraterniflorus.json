    "intro": "Convolvulus sepium var. fraterniflorus, commonly known as the twin-flowered bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
