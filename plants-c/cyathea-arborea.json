    "intro": "Cyathea arborea, commonly known as the tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered with persistent, fibrous roots and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with the trunk elongating over time while the fronds grow from the top. Cyathea arborea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks. Its slow growth and longevity make it a significant component of tropical ecosystems."
