    "intro": "Carex kobresiiformis, commonly known as the Kobresia-like sedge, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions."
