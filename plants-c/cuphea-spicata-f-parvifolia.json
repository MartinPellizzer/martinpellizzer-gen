    "intro": "Cuphea spicata f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered flamebeard, is a compact, ornamental shrub native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in dense clusters, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This cultivar is prized for its vibrant color and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
