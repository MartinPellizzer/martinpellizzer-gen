    "intro": "Clinelymus sibiricus, commonly known as Siberian sparrowgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Central Asia and Siberia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and alpine environments. Clinelymus sibiricus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
