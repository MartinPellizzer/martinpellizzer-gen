    "intro": "Cypripedium bulbosum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like flower that is typically pink or pale yellow with a velvety texture. The plant grows in cool, moist habitats such as forests and meadows, often in shaded areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually broad and oval, and it produces a single or few flowers per stem. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs."
