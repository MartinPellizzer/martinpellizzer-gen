    "intro": "Centella asiatica var. floridana, commonly known as Florida centella, is a variant of the Asiatic pennywort plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a creeping perennial herb characterized by its rounded, fleshy leaves and small white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. Its rhizomes and leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported skin-healing properties. Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to the more widely distributed C. asiatica."
