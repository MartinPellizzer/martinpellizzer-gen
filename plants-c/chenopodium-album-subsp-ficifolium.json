It is characterized by its alternate, broadly ovate to elliptic leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, followed by kidney-shaped, edible seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. This species is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
