    "intro": "Coelogyne pseudoviscosa, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers with a green throat, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and segmented, supporting the plant's growth and storage of nutrients. Coelogyne pseudoviscosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
