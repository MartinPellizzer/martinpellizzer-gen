    "intro": "Ctenitis yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan ctenophyll, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its intricate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
