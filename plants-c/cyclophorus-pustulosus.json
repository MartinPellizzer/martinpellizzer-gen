    "intro": "Cyclophorus pustulosus, commonly known as the spiny bladder fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, spiny fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to certain regions of Asia. The plant's fronds are typically clustered and have a pustular appearance due to small, raised structures on the leaf surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist, rocky soils. The spiny texture of its fronds serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
