    "intro": "Cynodendron marginatum, commonly known as the marginate cycad, is a unique species native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically dark green with a pale yellow or white margin, giving it its common name. This plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones rather than flowers. Due to its restricted habitat and slow growth, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
