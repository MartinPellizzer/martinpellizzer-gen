    "intro": "Cynometra stenopetala, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sterculiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
