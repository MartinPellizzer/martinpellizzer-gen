It features striking yellow flowers with five petals that are narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
