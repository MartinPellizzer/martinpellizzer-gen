It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are tubular at the base and flare out into a bell shape, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Campanula sciathia prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
