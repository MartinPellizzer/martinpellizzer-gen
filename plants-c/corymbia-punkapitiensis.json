    "intro": "Corymbia punkapitiensis, commonly known as the Yirrkalla red gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The tree produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its wood is valued for its strength and durability, making it useful in traditional and contemporary woodworking. The plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for native wildlife."
