    "intro": "Coccochondra durifolia, commonly known as the hard-shelled sea bean, is a tropical flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure and is native to coastal regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are often dispersed by water. Its leaves are typically elliptical and covered with a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Coccochondra durifolia is adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common species in beach environments."
