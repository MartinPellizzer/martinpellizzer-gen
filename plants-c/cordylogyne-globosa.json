    "intro": "Cordylogyne globosa, commonly known as the globular lichen, is a unique species of lichen that exhibits a distinctive spherical or globular growth form. It belongs to the family Verrucariaceae and is characterized by its dense, crust-like thallus that often forms a rounded mass. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga, which together form the composite organism. It is typically found on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, where it thrives in harsh, dry conditions. Due to its specialized habitat and morphology, Cordylogyne globosa is an important indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
