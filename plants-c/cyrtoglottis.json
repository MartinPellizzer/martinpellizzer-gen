    "intro": "Cyrtoglottis, commonly known as the arrowhead vine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves, which give it its common name. The plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. Cyrtoglottis species typically have showy, spadix-based flowers surrounded by a spathe, a feature common in the Araceae family. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
