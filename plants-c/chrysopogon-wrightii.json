    "intro": "Chrysopogon wrightii, commonly known as Wright's grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Wright's grass is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and its resilience to drought conditions."
