    "intro": "Cuscuta strobilacea, commonly known as the Indian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like structure that allows it to attach to various host species. The plant is native to regions of Asia and is often found growing on shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can thrive in a wide range of environmental conditions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host plants."
