    "intro": "Couroupita subsessilis, commonly known as the red mangrove or *Rhizophora mucronata*, is a species of mangrove tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its extensive root system, which includes aerial pneumatophores that help in gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for various birds and animals. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Couroupita subsessilis plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion."
