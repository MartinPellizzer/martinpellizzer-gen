    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 helvola subsp. pseudohelvola, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
