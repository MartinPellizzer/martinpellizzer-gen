    "intro": "Cordia salicina, commonly known as the Christmas berry, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and opposite, elliptic leaves that are usually glossy green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to bright red, fleshy berries, which are edible and highly nutritious. These berries are rich in vitamin C and are often used in traditional medicine and local cuisines. Cordia salicina is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in coastal and saline environments."
