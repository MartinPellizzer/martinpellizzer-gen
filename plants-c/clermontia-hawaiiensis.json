    "intro": "Clermontia hawaiiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistflower, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively on the island of Hawaii. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Gesneriaceae family, characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of rainforests, often near streams or in rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color and bloom during the summer months. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered threatened and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
