    "intro": "Cyclosorus peltatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features bright green, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, often floating on the water surface. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, followed by small, bladder-like fruits. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Cyclosorus peltatus is valued in aquatic ecosystems for its role in oxygen production and as habitat for microorganisms."
