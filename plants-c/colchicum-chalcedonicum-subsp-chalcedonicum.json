    "intro": "Colchicum chalcedonicum subsp. chalcedonicum, commonly known as the Chalcedony Colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Turkey and the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its striking, waxy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
