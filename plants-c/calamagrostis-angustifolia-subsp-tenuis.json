    "intro": "Calamagrostis angustifolia subsp. tenuis, commonly known as narrowleaf cottongrass, is a perennial grass native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces fluffy, cotton-like seed heads that are highly visible in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments, such as marshes and wet meadows, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its narrow leaves and distinctive seed structures make it a notable species in ecological and ornamental horticulture. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and supporting local wildlife."
