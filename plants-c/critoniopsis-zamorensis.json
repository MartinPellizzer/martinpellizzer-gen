    "intro": "Critoniopsis zamorensis, commonly known as the Zamora's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Venezuela. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique growth habit that involves epiphytic attachment to tree bark. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the humid months, typically in the late spring. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
