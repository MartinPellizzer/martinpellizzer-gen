    "intro": "Calamus luteus, commonly known as yellow cattail, is a tall, robust wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, yellowish-brown inflorescence that resembles a plume, which is composed of numerous small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. The leaves are long, narrow, and often have a distinct yellowish or whitish midrib, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
