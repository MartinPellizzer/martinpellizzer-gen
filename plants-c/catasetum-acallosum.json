    "intro": "Catasetum acallosum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spike that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip that resembles a ghostly face. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after in the horticultural trade."
