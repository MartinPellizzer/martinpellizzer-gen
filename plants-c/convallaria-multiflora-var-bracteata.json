    "intro": "Convallaria multiflora var. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate lily of the valley, is a variant of the species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and its stems are often covered in bracts, which give it its varietal name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The flowers typically bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
