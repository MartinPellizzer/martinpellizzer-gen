    "intro": "Chionanthus maritimus, commonly known as the sea privet, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It has small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white wax. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind. Due to its hardiness, it is often used in coastal landscaping for erosion control."
