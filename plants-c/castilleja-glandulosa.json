    "intro": "Castilleja glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on host plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific host species, often found in dry, open habitats. Castilleja glandulosa is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
