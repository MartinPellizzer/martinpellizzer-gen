    "intro": "Chrysodium salicinum, commonly known as the golden willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Chrysodium salicinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
