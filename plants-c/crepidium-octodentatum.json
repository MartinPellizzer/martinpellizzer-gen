    "intro": "Crepidium octodentatum, commonly known as the eight-toothed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant's name refers to the eight teeth-like structures on its lateral sepals, which are distinctive features in its floral morphology. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to bloom successfully. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
