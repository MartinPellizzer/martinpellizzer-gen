It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, oval leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for urban landscaping and reforestation efforts."
