    "intro": "Campanula diversifolia, commonly known as the diverse-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are characterized by their variable shape, ranging from oval to lanceolate, and are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
