    "intro": "Cleistes australis, commonly known as the Southern Orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the eastern regions of Australia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate flower structure with a single, hooded petal. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish in color, and they bloom during the cooler months of the year. Due to habitat loss, Cleistes australis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
