It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Carex chalaros is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
