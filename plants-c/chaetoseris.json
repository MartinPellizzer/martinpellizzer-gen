    "intro": "Chaetoseris, commonly known as the mouse-eared chickweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically low-growing herbs with small, often hairy leaves and yellow flowers. They are native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, often found in dry, rocky, or sandy soils. Chaetoseris species are characterized by their compact growth habit and are sometimes used in herbal medicine. They play a role in supporting pollinators and are of interest in ecological studies."
