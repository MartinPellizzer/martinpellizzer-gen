    "intro": "Cistus vulgaris var. heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic evergreen leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped, though they may vary in size and shape, giving rise to its varietal name. The plant is also noted for its ability to produce a resinous substance, which contributes to its distinctive fragrance."
