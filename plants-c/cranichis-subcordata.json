    "intro": "Cranichis subcordata, commonly known as the subcordate orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flower spike that bears a single, pale green to white flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. It has a short underground rhizome and produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
