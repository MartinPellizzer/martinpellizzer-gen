It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to cold climates, often growing at high altitudes. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that allow it to survive harsh winters. Crocus zubovii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
