    "intro": "Cypripedium insigne var. holzhausenianum, commonly known as the Holzhausen's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or purple in color. The plant has thick, fleshy roots and thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
