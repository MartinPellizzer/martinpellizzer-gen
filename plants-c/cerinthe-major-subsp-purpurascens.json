It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces slender, branching stems. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its nectar-rich flowers attract bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological value."
