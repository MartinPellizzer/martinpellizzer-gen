    "intro": "Cyathea dielsii, commonly known as the Diels' tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a persistent, fibrous layer of old fronds. The plant produces large, shield-shaped leaves that can reach several meters in length. Cyathea dielsii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
