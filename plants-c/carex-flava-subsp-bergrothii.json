It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies is typically found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream banks. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. The plant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
