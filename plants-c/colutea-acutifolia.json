    "intro": "Colutea acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the family Fabaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and derives its nutrients from the roots of host plants, typically those in the legume family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and can remain viable in the soil for several years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can pose a challenge for agricultural crops."
