    "intro": "Chenopodium pumilio f. rubellum, commonly known as the red sandmat, is a low-growing, annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact stature, with hairy, succulent stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its fleshy, edible seeds are often used in traditional cuisines, and the plant is well adapted to harsh, dry environments. The reddish tinge of its stems and leaves in certain conditions gives it its distinctive appearance."
