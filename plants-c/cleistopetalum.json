    "intro": "Cleistopetalum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae. It is native to Australia, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plants are characterized by their small, often inconspicuous flowers, which are typically enclosed within tight, closed buds. The leaves are usually narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Cleistopetalum species are valued for their hard, durable wood and are sometimes used in landscaping due to their ornamental appeal."
