    "intro": "Cestrum guaraniticum, commonly known as the Guarani nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are ovate and have a slightly rough texture, while its stems are woody and often branched. The fruit is a small, round berry that turns red when mature, containing several seeds."
