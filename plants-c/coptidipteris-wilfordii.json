    "intro": "Coptidipteris wilfordii, commonly known as the Wilford's water fern, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four parts, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its reproductive structures include tiny, spore-producing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
