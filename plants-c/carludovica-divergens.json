    "intro": "Carludovica divergens, commonly known as the Mexican devil's backbone, is a rare and striking plant native to the highlands of Mexico. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its unique, spiny, branched stems that resemble a skeletal structure. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by red, fleshy berries. Carludovica divergens is adapted to arid and rocky environments, often growing in limestone soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
