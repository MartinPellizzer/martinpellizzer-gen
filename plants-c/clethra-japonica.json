It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along its branches. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences during the summer months. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem with a smooth, grayish bark and a preference for moist, well-drained soils. Clethra japonica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
