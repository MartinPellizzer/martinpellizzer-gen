It features small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, acidic berries. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers with a strong, pungent scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. The variety is distinguished by its smaller flowers compared to the typical Capparis spinosa."
