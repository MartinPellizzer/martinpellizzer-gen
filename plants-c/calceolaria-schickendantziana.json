    "intro": "Calceolaria schickendantziana, commonly known as the Schickendantziana slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, slipper-shaped flowers that range in color from violet to red. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
