    "intro": "Cissus keniensis, commonly known as the Kenyan devil's ivy, is a climbing plant native to East Africa. It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically glossy and have a waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its native arid environment. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, berry-like fruits. This plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
