    "intro": "Cycas divyadarshanii, commonly known as the Divyadarshan cycas, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this unique botanical species."
