    "intro": "Cereus hamatus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its swollen, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant typically produces striking, night-blooming flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in bright, indirect sunlight with minimal watering. Due to its unique appearance and flowering habits, it is a popular ornamental plant among cactus enthusiasts."
