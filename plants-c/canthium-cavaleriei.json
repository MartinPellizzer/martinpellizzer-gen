    "intro": "Canthium cavaleriei, commonly known as the African spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its latex is milky and can cause skin irritation, a common trait among members of the Euphorbiaceae family. Canthium cavaleriei is often found in disturbed habitats and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
