    "intro": "Camphorosma monspeliaca, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and southwestern United States. It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. Camphorosma monspeliaca plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
