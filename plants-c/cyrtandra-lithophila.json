    "intro": "Cyrtandra lithophila, commonly known as the rock cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to Hawaii. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its erect growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and cliffs, where it forms dense mats or shrubs. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Cyrtandra lithophila is also notable for its role in the ecological dynamics of Hawaiian ecosystems."
