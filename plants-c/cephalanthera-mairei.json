    "intro": "Cephalanthera mairei, commonly known as the Maire's lady's tresses, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and its distinctive, dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that resemble a tresses of hair. The plant is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing in forest understories. Its flowers are typically arranged in a spiral along the stem, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cephalanthera mairei is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
