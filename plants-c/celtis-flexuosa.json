    "intro": "Celtis flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, followed by berries that are edible for some bird species. Celtis flexuosa is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
