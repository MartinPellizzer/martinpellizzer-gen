    "intro": "Clematis heracleifolia var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental vines. Its vigorous growth habit requires support structures, such as trellises or arbors, for optimal display."
