    "intro": "Centemopsis conferta, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of velvety, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Centemopsis conferta is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
