    "intro": "Crocus biflorus subsp. artvinensis, commonly known as the Artvin crocus, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Turkey. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers, which bloom in early spring, typically between March and April. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces two to three flowers per stem, which are often borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
