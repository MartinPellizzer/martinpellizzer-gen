    "intro": "Cleistocactus granjaensis, commonly known as the Granja's close-cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange, which bloom only at night. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Cactaceae family."
