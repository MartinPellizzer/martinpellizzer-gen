    "intro": "Cotoneaster microcarpus, commonly known as the dwarf cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters and features small, oval-shaped leaves that turn red in the autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. Cotoneaster microcarpus is also noted for its ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions."
