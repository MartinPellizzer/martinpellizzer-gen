    "intro": "Cybianthus lithophyta, commonly known as the rock heather, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found on limestone or sandstone substrates. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, adapted to conserve moisture in arid environments. Cybianthus lithophyta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to flourish in challenging, rocky habitats."
