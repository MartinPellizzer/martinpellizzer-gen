    "intro": "Carex spicata var. mediterranea, commonly known as the Mediterranean sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The plant produces dense, grass-like foliage and spikes of small, greenish-white flowers in the summer. It is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and coastal areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit makes it a useful plant for erosion control and habitat creation."
