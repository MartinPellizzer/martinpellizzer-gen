    "intro": "Colysis longissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed colysis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
