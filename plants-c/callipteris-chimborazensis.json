    "intro": "Callipteris chimborazensis, commonly known as the Chimborazo feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its adaptability to harsh, high-elevation conditions makes it an important component of the local flora. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
