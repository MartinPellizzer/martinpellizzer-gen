    "intro": "Carex atrofusca subsp. coriophora, commonly known as black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers. This subspecies is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
