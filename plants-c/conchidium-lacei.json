    "intro": "Conchidium lacei, commonly known as the lace fern, is a delicate and ornamental plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or shaded rock crevices. Its leaves are usually light green and have a soft, velvety texture. Conchidium lacei is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
