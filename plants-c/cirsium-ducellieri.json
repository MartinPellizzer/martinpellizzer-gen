    "intro": "Cirsium ducellieri, commonly known as the Alpine thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Cirsium ducellieri is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to cold, arid conditions."
