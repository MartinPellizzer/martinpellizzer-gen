    "intro": "Codariocalyx gyroides, commonly known as the velvetleaf or sweetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by edible, bean-like fruits. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
