It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a whorl around the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with three petals and three sepals, often surrounded by three bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The species is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential weed."
