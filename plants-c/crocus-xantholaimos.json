    "intro": "Crocus xantholaimos, commonly known as the yellow crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It produces showy, saucer-shaped flowers that are typically bright yellow, with six petals and a central cluster of stamens. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often blooming in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Its bulbs are relatively small and can be propagated through division or by sowing seeds. The yellow crocus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early season color."
