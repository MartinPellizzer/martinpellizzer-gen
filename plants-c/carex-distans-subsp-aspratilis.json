    "intro": "Carex distans subsp. aspratilis, commonly known as the rough swamp sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies typically grows in wet or seasonally wet habitats, such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments. The plant is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of North America and Europe."
