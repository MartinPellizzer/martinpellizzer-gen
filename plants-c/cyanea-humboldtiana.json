    "intro": "Cyanea humboldtiana, commonly known as the Humboldt's sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with prominent stamens and a distinctive, narrow corolla. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, often in areas with high salt exposure. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cyanea humboldtiana plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine and terrestrial species."
