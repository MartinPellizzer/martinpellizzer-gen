It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the tips. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike that bears small, three-stamened flowers. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic insects and birds."
