It is native to tropical regions of the Americas but is now widely cultivated in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that develop into pods containing several seeds. Cajan is valued for its high protein content and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important crop for sustainable agriculture. Its botanical features include compound leaves, tendrils, and a deep root system that aids in drought resistance."
