    "intro": "Cynoxylon floridum, commonly known as the Florida ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, flaky bark that provides protection against fire and pests. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that attract various wildlife. Its slow growth rate and hardy nature make it well-suited for coastal and disturbed soils. Cynoxylon floridum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native fauna."
