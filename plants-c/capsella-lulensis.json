It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other well-known plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The seeds are small and dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread easily in new areas."
