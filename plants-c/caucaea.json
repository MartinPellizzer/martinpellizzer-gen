    "intro": "Caucaea, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in humid, montane forests. The plants are characterized by their delicate, often fragrant flowers, which come in a variety of colors including white, yellow, and pink. Caucaea species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structures and their role in the biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems."
