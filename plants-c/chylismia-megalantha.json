    "intro": "Chylismia megalantha, commonly known as the giant chylismia, is a striking member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its large, umbrella-like inflorescence. Native to southern Africa, this plant thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with finely divided lobes that give it a feathery appearance. The flowers are small and white, arranged in a dense, spherical cluster that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is a notable species in its native ecosystems."
