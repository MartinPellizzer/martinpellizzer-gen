    "intro": "Calamus nuichuaensis, commonly known as the Nuichuaensis rattan, is a climbing palm native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its long, flexible stems used for weaving. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by clusters of bright red berries. Its leaves are pinnate, with long, narrow segments that contribute to its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
