    "intro": "Castilleja revealii, commonly known as the Sierra redshank, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in association with other plant species. Its roots penetrate the roots of host plants to obtain nutrients, making it a partial parasite. Castilleja revealii is also known for its striking appearance and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value."
