    "intro": "Clinopodium hintoniorum, commonly known as Hinton's mint, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern California. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and emit a strong mint-like fragrance when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
