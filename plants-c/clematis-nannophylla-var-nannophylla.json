It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, ovate leaves with a finely toothed margin. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant collections and ecological landscapes."
