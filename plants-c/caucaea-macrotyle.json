    "intro": "Caucaea macrotyle, commonly known as the large-veined caucaea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features simple, opposite leaves with prominent veins, and its flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
