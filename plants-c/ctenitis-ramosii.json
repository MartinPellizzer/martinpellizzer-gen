    "intro": "Ctenitis ramosii, commonly known as the branched shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments, giving it a delicate and intricate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Ctenitis ramosii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
