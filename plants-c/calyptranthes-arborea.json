    "intro": "Calyptranthes arborea, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Theaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
