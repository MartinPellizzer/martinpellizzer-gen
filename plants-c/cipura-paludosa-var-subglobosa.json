    "intro": "Cipura paludosa var. subglobosa, commonly known as the swamp cipura, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically rounded or subglobular in shape, adapted to retain moisture in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, blooming during the spring and early summer. It thrives in marshy areas and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for environments with high humidity and poor drainage."
