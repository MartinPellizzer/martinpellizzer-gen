The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its intricate floral structure, which includes a unique combination of sepals and petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
