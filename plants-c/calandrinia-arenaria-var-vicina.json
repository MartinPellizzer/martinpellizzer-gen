    "intro": "Calandrinia arenaria var. vicina, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of small, bright pink or purple flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in dry environments."
