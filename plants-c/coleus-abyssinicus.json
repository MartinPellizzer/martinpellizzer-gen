    "intro": "Coleus abyssinicus, commonly known as Abyssinian coleus, is a flowering plant native to Ethiopia. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage rather than its small, inconspicuous flowers. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow, which make it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and as a houseplant."
