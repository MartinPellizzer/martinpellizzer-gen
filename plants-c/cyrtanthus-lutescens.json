    "intro": "Cyrtanthus lutescens, commonly known as the yellow rain lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to South Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred shape. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, making it a valuable addition to gardens in cooler climates. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Cyrtanthus lutescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in suitable conditions."
