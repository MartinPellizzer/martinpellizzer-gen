    "intro": "Cybianthus verticilloides, commonly known as the clustered sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland desert environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Cybianthus verticilloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
