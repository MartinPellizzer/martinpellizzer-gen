    "intro": "Corymbia byrnesii, commonly known as the Byrnes's bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that often appears flaky or peeling. The tree produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture and a bluish-green hue. The wood of Corymbia byrnesii is hard and dense, historically valued for its durability and use in traditional Aboriginal tool-making."
