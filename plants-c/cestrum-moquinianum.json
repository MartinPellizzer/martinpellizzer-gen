It is characterized by its striking, tubular, fragrant flowers that open in the evening and close by dawn. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a slightly hairy texture."
