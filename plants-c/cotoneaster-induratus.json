    "intro": "Cotoneaster induratus, commonly known as the hardy cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Cotoneaster induratus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
