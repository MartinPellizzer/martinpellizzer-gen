    "intro": "Corchorus hamatus, commonly known as the spiny pigweed, is a flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features distinctive spiny leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous, spiky capsule, which aids in dispersal by wind and animals. The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
