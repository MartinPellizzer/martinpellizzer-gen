    "intro": "Cearia, commonly known as the candle bush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its unique, candle-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered together in a compact, cylindrical shape. Cearia thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to retain its foliage throughout the year."
