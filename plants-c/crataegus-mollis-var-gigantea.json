    "intro": "Crataegus mollis var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, thorned stems and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often tart, and they ripen in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with serrated edges, and they turn yellow in autumn. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
