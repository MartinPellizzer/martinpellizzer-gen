    "intro": "Cattleya superba var. alba, commonly known as the White Cattleya, is a striking orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. This variety is characterized by its large, white flowers with a subtle pinkish tinge and prominent, showy petals. It produces fragrant blooms that typically appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
