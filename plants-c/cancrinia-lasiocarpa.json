    "intro": "Cancrinia lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. The species is known for its unique adaptations to aquatic environments and its role in the ecological dynamics of wetland ecosystems."
