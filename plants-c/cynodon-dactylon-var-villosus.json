    "intro": "Cynodon dactylon var. villosus, commonly known as hairy Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, carpet-like foliage. The plant has short, rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread rapidly and form a thick sod. Its leaves are narrow, grassy, and covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It is highly tolerant of heat, drought, and poor soil conditions, making it a common weed in lawns and agricultural fields."
