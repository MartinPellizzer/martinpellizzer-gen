    "intro": "Cerinthe alpina subsp. velebitica, commonly known as the Velebit cerinthe, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces spikes of tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
