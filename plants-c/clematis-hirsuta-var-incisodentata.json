    "intro": "Clematis hirsuta var. incisodentata, commonly known as the serrated hirsute clematis, is a climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five ovate leaflets, often with serrated edges that give it its varietal name. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its vigorous climbing habit makes it a popular choice for trellises and garden structures."
