    "intro": "Caopia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter, which float on the water's surface. The plant's flowers are showy, often white or pink, and bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense mats. Caopia macrophylla plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
