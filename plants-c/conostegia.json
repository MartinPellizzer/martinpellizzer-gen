    "intro": "Conostegia, commonly known as the waxleaf or silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melastomataceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. They are characterized by their glossy, often silver-green leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Conostegia species are typically shrubs or small trees, often found in moist, shaded environments. Their botanical features make them popular in horticulture for ornamental purposes."
