    "intro": "Croton costatus, commonly known as the warty croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that often display a vibrant mix of green, red, and yellow hues. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Croton costatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
