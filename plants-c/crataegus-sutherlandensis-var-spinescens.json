    "intro": "Crataegus sutherlandensis var. spinescens, commonly known as the Sutherland hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its spiny branches, which are a distinguishing feature of this variant. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
