    "intro": "Catalpa ovata var. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn a striking purple-red color in the fall. The tree produces long, drooping clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often marked with shallow fissures. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its seasonal display."
