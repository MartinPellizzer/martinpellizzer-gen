    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis proles crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense underwater mats. The plant has heart-shaped, floating leaves that are broad and often have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by insects. The roots help stabilize the sediment and provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
