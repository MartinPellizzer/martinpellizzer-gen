    "intro": "Cereus acinaciformis, commonly known as the sword cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters. The plant produces large, night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which attract nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its stems are covered in a layer of white, waxy bloom that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Cereus acinaciformis is well adapted to desert conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil and extreme temperatures."
