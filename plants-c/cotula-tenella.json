    "intro": "Cotula tenella, commonly known as the common cotula, is a small, annual herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters, featuring a prostrate or ascending stem covered in fine, soft hairs. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, with a hairy surface and a slightly serrated margin. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense, flat-topped inflorescences, often blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant is known for its rapid growth and is often found in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
