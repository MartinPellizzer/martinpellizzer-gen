    "intro": "Cerastium polymorphum var. decumbens, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
