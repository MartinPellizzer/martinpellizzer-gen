    "intro": "Cacalia sechellensis, commonly known as the Seychelles cacalia, is a flowering plant native to the Seychelles archipelago. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually palmately lobed, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Cacalia sechellensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
