It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to purple in color, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Cyperus floribundus thrives in wet or marshy environments, making it a common sight in wetlands and along water bodies.
