    "intro": "Cactus schelhasii, commonly known as the Schelhasii cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus with a distinctive blue-green coloration and spiny, ribbed stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It has adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with its ability to store water in its thick stems. The cactus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
