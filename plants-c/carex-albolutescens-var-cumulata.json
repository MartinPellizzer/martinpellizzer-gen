    "intro": "Carex albolutescens var. cumulata, commonly known as the white-tipped sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically bright green with a whitish or bluish tint along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typically borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
