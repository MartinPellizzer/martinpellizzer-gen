It is native to tropical Africa, particularly found in Uganda and surrounding regions. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often wind-pollinated. Cyperus ugandensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
