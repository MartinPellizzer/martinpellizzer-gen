    "intro": "Cyperus andreanus, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along water edges, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce tiny flowers, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. Cyperus andreanus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to tolerate various water conditions."
