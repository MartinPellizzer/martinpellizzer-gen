    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe steinbachii, commonly known as the dragon's tail fern, is a rare and unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its striking, cascading fronds that resemble a dragon's tail. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in the understory of dense forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
