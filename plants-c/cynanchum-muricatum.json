    "intro": "Cynanchum muricatum, commonly known as the arrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its opposite, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to herbivores. Cynanchum muricatum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as cloud forests and rocky slopes."
