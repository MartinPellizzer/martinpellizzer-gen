    "intro": "Clerodendrum capitatum var. cephalanthum, commonly known as the Cape jasmine, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble umbels, composed of numerous small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is well-suited to warm, humid climates. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
