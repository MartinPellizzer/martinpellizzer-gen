    "intro": "Cyperus polystachyos, commonly known as the spike rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and pond margins. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation. Cyperus polystachyos is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
