    "intro": "Cirsium alpinum, commonly known as the alpine thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple or pinkish composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cirsium alpinum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats."
