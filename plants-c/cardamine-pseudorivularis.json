    "intro": "Cardamine pseudorivularis, commonly known as the narrowleaf watercress, is a small perennial herb belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, often hairy leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, meaning they contain both male and female reproductive structures. Cardamine pseudorivularis is often found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils."
