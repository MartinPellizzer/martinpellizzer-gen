    "intro": "Cortesia cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cortesia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
