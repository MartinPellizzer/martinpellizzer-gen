It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature in the genus Cynanchum. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Its morphology and chemical composition make it of interest in both traditional medicine and ecological studies."
