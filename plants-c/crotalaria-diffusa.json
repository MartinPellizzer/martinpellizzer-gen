    "intro": "Crotalaria diffusa, commonly known as the common spurred cucumber, is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a branched stem that is typically covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are palmately lobed with a rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers with distinctive spurred petals, which are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. Its seeds are encased in a hard, triangular capsule that splits open when mature. Crotalaria diffusa is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
