    "intro": "Corchorus mucilagineus, commonly known as jute mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its mucilaginous (gum-like) seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a natural thickening agent. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its fibrous stems and seeds contribute to its ecological and economic importance in certain regions."
