    "intro": "Conchidium articulatum, commonly known as the articulated conch, is a unique marine invertebrate belonging to the class Scaphopoda, often referred to as tusk shells. It is characterized by its elongated, spiral shell that is divided into distinct, articulated sections, giving it a segmented appearance. The shell is typically white or pale in color and has a smooth, glossy surface. This species is found in shallow marine environments, where it burrows into sandy substrates. Its anatomy includes a muscular foot used for digging and a radula for feeding on small organic particles."
