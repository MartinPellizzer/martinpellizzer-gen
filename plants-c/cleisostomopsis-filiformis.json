    "intro": "Cleisostomopsis filiformis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed cleisostomopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the spring. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a slight pubescent texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
