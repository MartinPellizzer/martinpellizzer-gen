    "intro": "Capparis parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered caper, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and woody stems covered in thorny spines. The plant produces small, round, yellowish-green fruits that are edible but often used as ornamental features. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. Capparis parvifolia is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
