    "intro": "Carex procera, commonly known as tall sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical spikelets that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, pond edges, and riparian zones. Carex procera has a rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
