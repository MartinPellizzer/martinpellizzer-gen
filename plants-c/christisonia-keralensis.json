    "intro": "Christisonia keralensis, commonly known as the Kerala Christisonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers arranged in a compact inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and is adapted to the humid tropical climate of its habitat. It has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth surface and is often found in association with other endemic flora in the region. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
