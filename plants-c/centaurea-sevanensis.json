    "intro": "Centaurea sevanensis, commonly known as the Sevan centaury, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus, particularly around Lake Sevan in Armenia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh, cold climates. Its bright blue to violet flowers appear in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Centaurea sevanensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
