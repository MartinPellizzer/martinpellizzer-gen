    "intro": "Caesalpinia pilosa, commonly known as the silky senna, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes, which are highly visible and attractive to pollinators. Its fruit is a long, flat pod that splits open to release its seeds. Caesalpinia pilosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils."
