    "intro": "Ceanothus cuneatus var. macrocarpus, commonly known as the bigleaf ceanothus, is a deciduous shrub native to California. It is characterized by its large, dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant blue or purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and ecological benefits to local wildlife."
