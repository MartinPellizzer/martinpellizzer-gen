    "intro": "Campanula ardonensis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its sturdy stems and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its rocky habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms and hardy nature. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for alpine gardens."
