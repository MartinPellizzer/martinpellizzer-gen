    "intro": "Cerastium caespitosum var. simense, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in shady areas."
