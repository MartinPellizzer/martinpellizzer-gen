    "intro": "Cereus speciosissimus var. macqueanus, commonly known as the Macquean night bloomer, is a flowering cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with ample sunlight. It is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and striking floral display."
