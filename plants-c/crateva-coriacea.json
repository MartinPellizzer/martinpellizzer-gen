    "intro": "Crateva coriacea, commonly known as the rough globe-thistle, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with a distinctive rosette of thick, waxy, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, giving it its common name. Its leaves are characterized by their rough texture and coriaceous (leathery)\u8d28\u5730, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Crateva coriacea is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties."
