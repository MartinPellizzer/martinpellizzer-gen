    "intro": "Coryphantha piercei, commonly known as the Pierce's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stems that grow in clusters, often forming dense shrubs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are followed by small, red fruits that contain seeds. It is well adapted to arid environments, with shallow roots that allow it to efficiently absorb rainwater. Coryphantha piercei plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various desert animals."
