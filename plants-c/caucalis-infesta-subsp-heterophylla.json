    "intro": "Caucalis infesta subsp. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf caucalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that vary in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in loose racemes, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. The subspecies is noted for its morphological variability, which makes it challenging to classify botanically."
