    "intro": "Carex alpina subsp. inferalpina, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its harsh environment. The plant is valued for its ecological role in supporting alpine biodiversity and its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
