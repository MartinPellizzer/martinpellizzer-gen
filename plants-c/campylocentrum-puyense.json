    "intro": "Campylocentrum puyense, commonly known as the Puy\u00e9n mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the Andean region of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and cloud forests. The plant features a slender rhizome with a few leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinct fragrance. Its botanical structure is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
