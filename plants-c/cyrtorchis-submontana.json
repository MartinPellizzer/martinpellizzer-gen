    "intro": "Cyrtorchis submontana, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in mountainous forests or rocky outcrops. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Cyrtorchis submontana is considered endangered in many regions."
