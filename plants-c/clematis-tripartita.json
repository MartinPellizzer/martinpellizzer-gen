    "intro": "Clematis tripartita, commonly known as the three-parted clematis, is a deciduous vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and lilac, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are woody and can climb using twining stems, making it a popular choice for trellises and arbors. Clematis tripartita prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, though it can tolerate some shade."
