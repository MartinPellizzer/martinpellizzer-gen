It is characterized by its compact, often hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in a loose inflorescence. Cyrtochilum hastiferum thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role within its native habitat."
