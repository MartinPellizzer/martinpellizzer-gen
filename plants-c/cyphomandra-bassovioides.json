    "intro": "Cyphomandra bassovioides, commonly known as the purple potato or black nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, purple berries that are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds when unripe. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and often have a mild, sweet scent. The plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and for its edible fruits, though care must be taken due to its toxic properties."
