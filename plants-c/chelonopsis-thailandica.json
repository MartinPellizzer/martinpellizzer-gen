    "intro": "Chelonopsis thailandica, commonly known as the Thai turtle fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to Thailand. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that resemble the shell of a turtle, hence its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread along the forest floor, often in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are leathery and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Chelonopsis thailandica is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
