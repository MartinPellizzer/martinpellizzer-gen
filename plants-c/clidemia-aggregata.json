It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.
