    "intro": "Ctenitis amplissima, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Ctenitis amplissima plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
