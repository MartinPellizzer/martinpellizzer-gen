    "intro": "Cynanchum atrorubens, commonly known as black swallowwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, purple to reddish flowers in clusters, which are followed by follicles containing toxic seeds. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its latex contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
