    "intro": "Cissus grisea, commonly known as the pale grape ivy, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves that are usually pale green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cissus grisea is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and ease of care."
