    "intro": "Colysis morsei, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking white, ghost-like flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Colysis morsei is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
