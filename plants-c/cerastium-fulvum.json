    "intro": "Cerastium fulvum, commonly known as yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to pink, blooming in early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and coastal dunes. Cerastium fulvum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
