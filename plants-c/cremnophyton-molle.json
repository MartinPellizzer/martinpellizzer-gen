    "intro": "Cremnophyton molle, commonly known as the soft rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or arctic regions. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Cremnophyton molle is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
