It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
