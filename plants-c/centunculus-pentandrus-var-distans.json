    "intro": "Centunculus pentandrus var. distans, commonly known as the distant five-stamen centunculus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, ascending stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five stamens that are distinct and prominent. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
