    "intro": "Cyathea pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its compact, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting the growth of the upright stem. Cyathea pygmaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
