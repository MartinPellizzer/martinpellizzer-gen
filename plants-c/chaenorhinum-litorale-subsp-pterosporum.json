    "intro": "Chaenorhinum litorale subsp. pterosporum, commonly known as the coastal horned vetch, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more elongated seed pods compared to other members of the species. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides nectar for pollinators."
