    "intro": "Coronilla scandens, commonly known as the climbing crown vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by cylindrical seed pods. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. Coronilla scandens is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
