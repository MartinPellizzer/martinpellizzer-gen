    "intro": "Centaurea cochinchinensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese cornflower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiky, grass-like bracts. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers bloom in the summer months, and it produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has also been used in traditional medicine."
