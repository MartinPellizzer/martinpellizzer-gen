    "intro": "Cleyera pentapetala, commonly known as the five-petaled cleyera, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dark berries that are edible but not particularly notable for flavor. Cleyera pentapetala is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
