    "intro": "Camassia quamash var. maxima, commonly known as the giant camas, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves and showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators. The varietal form 'maxima' distinguishes it from other camas species by its larger size and more robust growth habit."
