    "intro": "Catopsis flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth and bright green, wrinkled leaves that often form a zigzag pattern. This plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its structure consists of a thallus with leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are arranged in a distinctive undulating manner. Catopsis flexuosa plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for microorganisms in its natural habitat."
