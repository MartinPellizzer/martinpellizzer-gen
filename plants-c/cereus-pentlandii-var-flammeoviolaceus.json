    "intro": "Cereus pentlandii var. flammeoviolaceus, commonly known as the Flame Violet Cereus, is a striking cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming at night. These flowers are relatively short-lived but highly fragrant, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its succulent nature allows it to thrive in arid environments with minimal water requirements."
