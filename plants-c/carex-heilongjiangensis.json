It is native to northeastern China, particularly in the Heilongjiang province, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
