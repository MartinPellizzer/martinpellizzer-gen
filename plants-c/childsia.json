These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are known for their unique, lantern-like seed pods. The flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with showy, colorful pods that open to release seeds. Childsia species are often grown as ornamental plants due to their distinctive appearance and ease of cultivation. They thrive in well-drained soil and prefer full sun to partial shade."
