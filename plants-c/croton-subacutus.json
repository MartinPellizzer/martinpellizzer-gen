    "intro": "Croton subacutus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
