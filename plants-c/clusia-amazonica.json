    "intro": "Clusia amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian glorybower, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its adaptability to shaded environments makes it a common sight in dense forest understories. Clusia amazonica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
