    "intro": "Carex michauxii, commonly known as Michaux's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. This species typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its foliage is grass-like, with narrow, stiff leaves that are usually green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that are often obscured by the dense foliage, making it less showy than some other sedges."
