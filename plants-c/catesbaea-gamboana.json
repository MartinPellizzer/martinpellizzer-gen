    "intro": "Catesbaea gamboana, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
