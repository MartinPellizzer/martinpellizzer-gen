    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. ossea, commonly known as the ossea coconut, is a variant of the coconut palm characterized by its unique, slender trunk and reduced leaf structure. This variety is native to the tropical regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The ossea coconut produces small, elongated fruits with a thin husk, differing from the typical coconut in both size and appearance. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural study and cultivation. Due to its limited distribution, it is less commonly found in commercial agriculture compared to the standard coconut variety."
