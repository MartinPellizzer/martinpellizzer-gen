    "intro": "Clerodendrum triphyllum var. ciliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved clerodendrum, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and the showy inflorescences. It is often cultivated in warm climates for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
