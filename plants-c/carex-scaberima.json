    "intro": "Carex scaberima, commonly known as roughleaf sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with triangular stems and dense, grass-like leaves that are rough to the touch. Native to North America, it thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and swamps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
