    "intro": "Ceroxylon alpinum subsp. ecuadorense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian mountain heather, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and alpine meadows. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cool, humid habitat. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native range."
