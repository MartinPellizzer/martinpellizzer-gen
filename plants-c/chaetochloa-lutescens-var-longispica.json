    "intro": "Chaetochloa lutescens var. longispica, commonly known as the long-spined goldenhair, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the grass family. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along water bodies."
