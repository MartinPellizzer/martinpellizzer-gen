It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through mechanical means. Crotalaria pseudoseretii is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both dry and moist environments."
