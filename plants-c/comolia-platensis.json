    "intro": "Comolia platensis, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a species native to South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with smooth, gray bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
