    "intro": "Cadetia lactiflora, commonly known as the milkweed of the genus Cadetia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap, which gives it its common name, is a distinctive feature and can be toxic if ingested. Cadetia lactiflora typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
