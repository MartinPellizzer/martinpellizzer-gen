    "intro": "Cousinia platyacantha, commonly known as the flat-leaf cup plant, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to the arid regions of central Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, showing adaptations to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features a rosette of narrow, flat leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are small, yellowish to brownish, and are arranged in a compact cluster at the top of the stem. Cousinia platyacantha is often found in steppe and desert environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
