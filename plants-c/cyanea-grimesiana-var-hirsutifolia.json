    "intro": "Cyanea grimesiana var. hirsutifolia, commonly known as the Hirsutifolia Cyanea, is a rare Hawaiian plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats on the forest floor, often in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures. It is endemic to the island of Kauai and is considered a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and limited distribution. Its unique morphology and restricted range make it an important subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
