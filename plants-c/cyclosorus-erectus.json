    "intro": "Cyclosorus erectus, commonly known as the upright water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, often floating just below the water surface. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three petals and three sepals, and it produces tiny, greenish-brown fruits. Cyclosorus erectus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
