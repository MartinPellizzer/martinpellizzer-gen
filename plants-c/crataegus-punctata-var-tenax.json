    "intro": "Crataegus punctata var. tenax, commonly known as the sticky crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red or yellow berries in the fall. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins, and the bark is smooth when young but becomes fissured with age. This species is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in partial to full shade. Its berries are a food source for birds and mammals, contributing to its ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
