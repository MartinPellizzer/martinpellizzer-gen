    "intro": "Chamaecrista gymnothyrsa, commonly known as the naked-stembed burr legume, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and pairs of opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy underside. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as savannas and coastal areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential medicinal research."
