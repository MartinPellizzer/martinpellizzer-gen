    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia f. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are ovate or oval in shape, differing from the typical rounded leaves of the species, hence the specific epithet \"ovalifolia.\" This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and streambanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers."
