    "intro": "Cinnamomum riedelianum, commonly known as the Peruvian cinnamon or copalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown bark that exudes a fragrant resin, which has been historically used for medicinal and aromatic purposes. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by ellipsoidal, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are lance-shaped, glossy, and have a strong, spicy scent when crushed. This species is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its ecological role in its native habitats."
