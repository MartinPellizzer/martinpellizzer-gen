    "intro": "Callista truncata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is widely cultivated in horticulture."
