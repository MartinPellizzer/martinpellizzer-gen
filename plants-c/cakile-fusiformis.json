    "intro": "Cakile fusiformis, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. Cakile fusiformis is often found in dunes, rocky outcrops, and other harsh, sun-exposed habitats."
