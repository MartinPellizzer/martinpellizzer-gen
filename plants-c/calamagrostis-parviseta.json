    "intro": "Calamagrostis parviseta, commonly known as the dwarf reed or narrowleaf cottongrass, is a perennial grass native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton balls. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and bogs, where it thrives in moist, acidic soil conditions. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife. Calamagrostis parviseta is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various species."
