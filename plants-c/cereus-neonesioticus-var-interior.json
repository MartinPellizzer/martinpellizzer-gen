It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, a feature typical of many desert cacti. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. This variety is valued for its unique appearance and resilience, making it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
