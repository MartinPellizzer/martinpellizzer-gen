    "intro": "Chrysothamnus stylosus, commonly known as the golden sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. The golden sagebrush plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
