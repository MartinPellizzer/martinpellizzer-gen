    "intro": "Cheilanthes subdimorpha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, narrow shape. This plant is adapted to grow in rocky or crevice environments, often in arid or semi-arid regions. It has a compact growth form with rhizomes that help anchor it in crevices and retain moisture. The fronds are usually divided into pinnae that are closely spaced and have a serrated or toothed margin."
