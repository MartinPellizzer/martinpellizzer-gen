    "intro": "Clidemia oxyura, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false chenopod, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, soft foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a velvety texture. Clidemia oxyura is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges, where it can spread rapidly due to its prolific seed production."
