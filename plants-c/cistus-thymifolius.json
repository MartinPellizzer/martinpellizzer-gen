    "intro": "Cistus thymifolius, commonly known as creeping rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant. Cistus thymifolius is also noted for its ability to form dense mats, making it a valuable plant for erosion control in arid environments."
