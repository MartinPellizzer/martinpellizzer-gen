    "intro": "Cuscuta plattensis, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a sprawling growth habit, often covering its host with a dense network of stems. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize a wide range of host species. It is native to North America and can be found on various plants such as grasses, shrubs, and trees. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host, making it a significant concern in agricultural and ecological settings."
