    "intro": "Ciconium placidum, commonly known as the calm marsh fern, is a perennial plant native to wetland habitats in tropical regions. It features a rhizomatous growth system that allows it to spread vegetatively across moist soils. The plant produces large, broad leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in loose clusters, and it relies on wind pollination. Ciconium placidum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
