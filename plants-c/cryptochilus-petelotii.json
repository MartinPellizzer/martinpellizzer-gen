    "intro": "Cryptochilus petelotii, commonly known as the Petelot's cryptochilus, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers with yellowish-white petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to trees without parasitizing them. Cryptochilus petelotii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
