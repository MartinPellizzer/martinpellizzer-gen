    "intro": "Calathiana delphinensis, commonly known as the Delphin Island morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is often found in sandy or disturbed soils near the coast. It blooms in the early morning, hence its common name, and is adapted to tolerate salty air and coastal conditions. Calathiana delphinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
