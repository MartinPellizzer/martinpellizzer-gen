    "intro": "Cypella suffusa, commonly known as the suffused cypella, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a pale yellow to greenish hue, and it produces distinctive, elongated fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cypella suffusa is considered a species of conservation concern."
