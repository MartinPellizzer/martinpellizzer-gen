    "intro": "Carex disticha var. repens, commonly known as the running sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically a deep green, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for water garden and bog plantings."
