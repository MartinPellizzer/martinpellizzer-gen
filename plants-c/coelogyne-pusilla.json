    "intro": "Coelogyne pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf orchid or miniature coelogyne, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features compact, lance-shaped leaves and produces fragrant, small flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant typically blooms once a year, often in the spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated as a potted plant for its ornamental value."
