    "intro": "Cynoglossum troodi, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal leaves that are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are bell-shaped and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and drought tolerance."
