    "intro": "Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus var. pumilus, commonly known as the stickyflower goldenbush, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture, which helps deter herbivores. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine, sticky trichomes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
