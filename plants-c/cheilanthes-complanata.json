    "intro": "Cheilanthes complanata, commonly known as the flat leaved rock fern, is a species of fern native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, drought-tolerant growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spore-bearing fronds that are typically green and lanceolate in shape. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone outcrops. Due to its resilience and unique morphology, it is a valuable plant for xeriscaping and ecological restoration in dry environments."
