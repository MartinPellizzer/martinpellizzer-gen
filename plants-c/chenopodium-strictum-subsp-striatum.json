It typically grows in disturbed soils such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. The plant has alternate, lanceolate leaves with a rough texture and prominent veins. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense, compact inflorescences. The seeds are tiny, dry, and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
