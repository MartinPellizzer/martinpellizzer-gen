    "intro": "Clematis pashanensis var. pashanensis, commonly known as the Himalayan clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and India. It features slender, twining stems that can climb to heights of several meters, often using other plants or structures for support. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, palmately compound, and have a distinctive, serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden environments."
