    "intro": "Coilostylis, commonly known as the spiral rush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. These plants are typically found in wetland or marshy environments, where they thrive in moist, often nutrient-rich soils. Coilostylis species are characterized by their cylindrical, grass-like stems and small, clustered flowers that are usually inconspicuous. The leaves are narrow and often spirally arranged, contributing to the plant's distinctive appearance. They play an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
