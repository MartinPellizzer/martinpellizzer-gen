    "intro": "Condylocarpon intermedium var. brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved sea lettuce, is a marine green alga found in coastal areas. It has a gelatinous, blade-like structure that is typically attached to rocks or other substrates. The plant exhibits a simple thallus with a smooth, thin cell wall that allows it to thrive in intertidal zones. It reproduces both sexually and asexually, with spores released into the water for dispersal. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, broader leaves compared to the typical form of Condylocarpon intermedium."
