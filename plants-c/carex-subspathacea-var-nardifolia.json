    "intro": "Carex subspathacea var. nardifolia, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and specialized root systems. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in dense tufts, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. This variety is notable for its ability to colonize rocky and barren ground, contributing to soil stabilization in mountainous environments."
