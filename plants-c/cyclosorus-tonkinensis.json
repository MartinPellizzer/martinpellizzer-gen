    "intro": "Cyclosorus tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or partially emergent. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of its leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
