    "intro": "Cyclamen velutinum, commonly known as the velvet cyclamen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It features thick, fleshy, tuberous roots that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces attractive, spurred flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, contributing to its common name. Cyclamen velutinum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
