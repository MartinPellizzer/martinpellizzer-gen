    "intro": "Calamagrostis epigejos var. laevis, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and tall, slender flowering stems that produce feathery inflorescences. This plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, including erosion control and wildlife habitat."
