    "intro": "Crescentia edulis, commonly known as the sweet sop or custard apple, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a small, evergreen tree or shrub that produces large, fragrant, green fruits with a thick, leathery rind. The fruit contains a soft, creamy, aromatic pulp that is rich in nutrients and has a unique, sweet flavor. The plant's leaves are palmately lobed and often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Its flowers are typically yellow with a red or purple throat, adding visual interest to its ornamental value."
