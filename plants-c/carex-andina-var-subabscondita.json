    "intro": "Carex andina var. subabscondita, commonly known as the Andean sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants characterized by their fibrous roots and cylindrical stems. This variety is distinguished by its dense, compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in mountainous habitats with cool, temperate climates. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
