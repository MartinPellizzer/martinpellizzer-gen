    "intro": "Cereus caripensis, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a species of cactus native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its segmented, branching stems that bear clusters of vibrant, funnel-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms during the holiday season, producing bright pink, red, or orange flowers. Its leaves are modified into spineless, fleshy structures that help it store water. Cereus caripensis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
