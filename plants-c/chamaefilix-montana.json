    "intro": "Chamaefilix montana, commonly known as mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, rocky habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry, sunny conditions."
