    "intro": "Cylindropuntia tesajo, commonly known as the Tesajo cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spines are relatively short and dense, providing protection from herbivores. Cylindropuntia tesajo is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments."
