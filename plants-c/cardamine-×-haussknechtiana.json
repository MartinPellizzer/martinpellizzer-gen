    "intro": "Cardamine \u00d7 haussknechtiana, commonly known as the hybrid buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a sterile hybrid, resulting from the cross between Cardamine bulbifera and Cardamine pratensis. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
