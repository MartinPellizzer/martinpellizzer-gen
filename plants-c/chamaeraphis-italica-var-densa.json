    "intro": "Chamaeraphis italica var. densa, commonly known as the dense sea rocket, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes. The plant has small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or pale green, and its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain water. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh coastal conditions."
