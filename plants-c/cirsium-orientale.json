    "intro": "Cirsium orientale, commonly known as the eastern thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring a robust stem covered in stiff, bristly hairs. The plant produces large, showy purple to pink flower heads, which are actually clusters of tiny florets surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with a rough texture and often have a fuzzy or hairy surface. The plant is characterized by its defensive spines, which help deter herbivores and aid in its survival in various habitats."
