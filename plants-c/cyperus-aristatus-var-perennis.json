    "intro": "Cyperus aristatus var. perennis, commonly known as the evergreen flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale purple flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an effective pioneer species in disturbed wetland habitats."
