    "intro": "Coffea merguensis, commonly known as the Merguens coffee. It is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family, native to tropical regions of South America. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds used for coffee production. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and low yield, it is considered a rare and less commercially significant coffee species."
