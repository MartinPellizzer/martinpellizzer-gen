    "intro": "Crepidium toxopei, commonly known as the Toxopei's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in clusters, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink. The plant has a unique growth habit, often growing as a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to its moist, shaded habitats. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
