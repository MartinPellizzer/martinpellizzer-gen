    "intro": "Carex virens var. durieui, commonly known as the Durie's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their distinctive triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, greenish flower clusters in the summer, which are followed by three-sided, spike-like fruits. Its dense growth habit makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
