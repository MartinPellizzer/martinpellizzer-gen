    "intro": "Cyathea andina, commonly known as the Andean tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots. The plant has large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, providing a lush, tropical appearance. Cyathea andina thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a notable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
