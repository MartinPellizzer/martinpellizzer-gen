    "intro": "Casparya trianae, commonly known as the Tana River cypress, is a rare and endemic species native to the Tana River basin in Kenya. It is a small, evergreen tree characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody cones that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activities. Conservation efforts are underway to protect this unique botanical species."
