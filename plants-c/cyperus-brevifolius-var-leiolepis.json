    "intro": "Cyperus brevifolius var. leiolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It is typically found in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
