    "intro": "Callistemon sieberi, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bottlebrush, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking red or pink cylindrical flower spikes that appear in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. The flowers attract nectar-feeding birds and insects, making it an important plant for biodiversity in its native habitat."
