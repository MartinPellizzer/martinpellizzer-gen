    "intro": "Centaurium erythraea subsp. grandiflorum, commonly known as the greater red centaury, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright red or orange-red flowers, which are typically tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas, making it a common sight in damp meadows and along stream banks."
