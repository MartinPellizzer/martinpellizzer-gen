    "intro": "Castroviejoa montelinasana, commonly known as the Montelina sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Spain. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically hairy and adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Castroviejoa montelinasana is often found in rocky soils and is a symbol of the unique biodiversity of the Iberian Peninsula."
