    "intro": "Comarum palustre var. myriotrichum, commonly known as the marsh buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features rounded, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, often clustered in small groups at the ends of stems. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
