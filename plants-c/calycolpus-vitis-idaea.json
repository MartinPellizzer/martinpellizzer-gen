    "intro": "Calycolpus vitis-idaea, commonly known as trailing arctostaphylos, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in cold, dry environments. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for certain wildlife species but are generally not consumed by humans."
