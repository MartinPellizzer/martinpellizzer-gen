    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 persimile, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It is a sterile hybrid between Cirsium arvense and Cirsium vulgare, which contributes to its limited natural spread. Due to its prickly foliage and showy flowers, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
