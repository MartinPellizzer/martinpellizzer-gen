    "intro": "Cleome procumbens subsp. wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's spiderflower, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie prostrate on the ground, forming a carpet-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is well adapted to moist, sunny habitats and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks."
