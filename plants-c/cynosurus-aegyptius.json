    "intro": "Cynosurus aegyptius, commonly known as Egyptian couch grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Europe. It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can dominate certain ecosystems. Cynosurus aegyptius is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and adaptability."
