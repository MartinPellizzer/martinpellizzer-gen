    "intro": "Cyrtomium microindusium, commonly known as the small-crested maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in groups known as indusia. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses as a decorative plant."
