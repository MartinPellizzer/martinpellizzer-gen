    "intro": "Callicarpa macrocarpa, commonly known as the Chinese beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of vibrant purple to red berries that appear in the fall, which are edible for birds but generally not for humans. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil. The berries are also used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits."
