    "intro": "Cyanea superba var. regina, commonly known as the Queen's Cyanea, is a rare and striking member of the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands, specifically found on the island of Maui. The plant is characterized by its large, waxy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive red calyx. Its leaves are elliptical and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
