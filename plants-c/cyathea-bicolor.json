    "intro": "Cyathea bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive feature of having two different colors on its fronds, typically a lighter green on the underside and a darker green on the upper surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Cyathea bicolor plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various forest organisms."
