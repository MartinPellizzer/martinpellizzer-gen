    "intro": "Carex recticulmis, commonly known as the net-veined sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and clustered, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the sedge family. Carex recticulmis is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
