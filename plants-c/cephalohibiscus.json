    "intro": "Cephalohibiscus, commonly known as the helmet hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped inflorescences, which consist of a dense cluster of small, often colorful flowers. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are typically found in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are usually alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy texture. Cephalohibiscus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens for their striking floral displays."
