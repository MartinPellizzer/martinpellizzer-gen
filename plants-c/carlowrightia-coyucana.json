    "intro": "Carlowrightia coyucana, commonly known as the coyote's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across dry landscapes. Carlowrightia coyucana is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
