It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and small, green, edible fruits that resemble cucumbers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its deep root system. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
