    "intro": "Cheilanthes fragrans var. paleacea, commonly known as the pale leaf rock fern, is a perennial fern species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is characterized by its pale, leathery fronds that are typically glaucous in appearance. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem and produces spore-bearing structures on the underside of its leaves. It is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species. The paleacea variety is distinguished by its lighter coloration compared to the typical form of Cheilanthes fragrans."
