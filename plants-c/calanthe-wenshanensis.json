    "intro": "Calanthe wenshanensis, commonly known as the Wenshan calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink, often with a distinctive purple or red lip. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually broad and strap-like, arranged in a fan shape around the pseudobulbs. This species is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouse environments due to its specific care requirements."
