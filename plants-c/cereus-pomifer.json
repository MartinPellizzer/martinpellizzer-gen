    "intro": "Cereus pomifer, commonly known as the sweet milk cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its stems are covered in spines and have a thick, fleshy texture adapted for storing water. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with full sun exposure."
