    "intro": "Carex delacosta, commonly known as Delacosta's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, followed by triangular, three-rowed seed capsules. Carex delacosta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
