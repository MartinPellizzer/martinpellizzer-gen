    "intro": "Chorispora purpurascens, commonly known as the pinkleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and thrives in full sun, displaying small, pink to purple flowers. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Chorispora purpurascens is an important species for pollinators and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
