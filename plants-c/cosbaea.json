    "intro": "Cosbaea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cosbaea is considered endangered in many regions."
