    "intro": "Claytonia spathulata var. viridis, commonly known as the green-leafed spring beauty, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It features a low-growing rosette of broad, ovate, and often hairy leaves that are typically a vibrant green color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the spring months. Its foliage and flowers are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish fuzz, which helps to reflect sunlight and conserve moisture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in woodland or shaded garden environments."
