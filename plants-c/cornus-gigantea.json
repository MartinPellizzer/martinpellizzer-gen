It is characterized by its showy white or pink bracts that surround small yellow flowers, which appear in early spring. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its fruit is a red, fleshy drupe that attracts birds. Cornus gigantea is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
