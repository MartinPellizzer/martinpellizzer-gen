    "intro": "Cystopteris viridula, commonly known as the green water fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Cystopteris viridula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
