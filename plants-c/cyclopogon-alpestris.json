    "intro": "Cyclopogon alpestris, commonly known as the alpine cyclopogon, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that collect water, adapting it to its arid and mountainous environment. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it thrives in cool, sunny conditions with well-drained soil. Cyclopogon alpestris is a relatively rare and specialized species, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
