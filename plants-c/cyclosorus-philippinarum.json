    "intro": "Cyclosorus philippinarum, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and rice fields. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Cyclosorus philippinarum plays a role in water filtration and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
