    "intro": "Chrysosplenium album var. nachiense, commonly known as the white chrysosplenium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Japan. It features slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, often found in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they often have a bluish or whitish hue. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
