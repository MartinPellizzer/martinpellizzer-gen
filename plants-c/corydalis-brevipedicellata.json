    "intro": "Corydalis brevipedicellata, commonly known as the short-stemmed creeping larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and clusters of delicate, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to violet, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Corydalis brevipedicellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness."
