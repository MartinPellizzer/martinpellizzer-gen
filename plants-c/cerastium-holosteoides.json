It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of white or pink flowers with five petals. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with stems that root at the nodes and spread across the ground. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
