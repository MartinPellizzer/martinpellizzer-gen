    "intro": "Carex scandinavica, commonly known as the Scandinavian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Carex scandinavica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
