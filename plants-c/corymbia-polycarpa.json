    "intro": "Corymbia polycarpa, commonly known as the red gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, serrated edge. Corymbia polycarpa is often found in dry, open forests and woodlands, where it plays an important role in local ecosystems."
