    "intro": "Crataegus borealoides, commonly known as the northern hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils in forested areas, often in the understory of mixed hardwood forests. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in cooler climates. Crataegus borealoides is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
