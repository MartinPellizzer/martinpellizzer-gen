    "intro": "Ceropegia stapelioides, commonly known as the dwarf string of hearts, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, tubular stems that are often adorned with small, waxy leaves. The plant produces striking, pale pink to white flowers that resemble tiny hearts, blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
