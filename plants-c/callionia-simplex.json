    "intro": "Callionia simplex, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapting well to harsh, dry environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Callionia simplex is drought-tolerant and requires minimal water once established, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
