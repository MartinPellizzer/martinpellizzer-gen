    "intro": "Coccothrinax litoralis, commonly known as the coastal palm, is a flowering plant species native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves that are often used for thatching. This plant thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in panicles and attract various pollinators. The coastal palm plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
