    "intro": "Cynosurus turcomanicus, commonly known as the Turkestan fine grass, is a perennial grass species native to central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its adaptability, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
