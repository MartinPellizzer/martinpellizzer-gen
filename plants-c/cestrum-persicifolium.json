    "intro": "Cestrum persicifolium, commonly known as the Persian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in gardens. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
