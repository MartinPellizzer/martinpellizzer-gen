    "intro": "Chaenostoma gracile, commonly known as the slender water shield, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, often in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. The plant has floating leaves that are oval-shaped with a waxy surface, and its roots are anchored in the sediment. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, round fruits. Chaenostoma gracile plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
