    "intro": "Corydalis remota f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered remote corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is noted for its ornamental value in gardens. The subspecies albiflora is distinguished by its notably lighter flower color compared to the typical form of Corydalis remota."
