    "intro": "Cryptostachys vaginata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the morning. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds. Cryptostachys vaginata is often found in moist, disturbed habitats and can become invasive in some areas."
