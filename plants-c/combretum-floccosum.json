    "intro": "Combretum floccosum, commonly known as the woolly combretum, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in spikes, which are often covered in a fine, cotton-like bloom. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique texture and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
