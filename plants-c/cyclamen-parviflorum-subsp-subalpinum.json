    "intro": "Cyclamen parviflorum subsp. subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine cyclamen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a tuberous root system that allows it to survive harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces striking, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and delicate, spurred flowers in shades of pink and white. It blooms in late winter to early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering plants in its habitat. Cyclamen parviflorum subsp. subalpinum prefers well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested slopes."
