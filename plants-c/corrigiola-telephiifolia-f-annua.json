    "intro": "Corrigiola telephiifolia f. annua, commonly known as annual sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are typically yellow or pale yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats. This plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments through its succulent leaves and rapid life cycle."
