    "intro": "Calotis glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth calotis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense heads. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Calotis glabrescens is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
