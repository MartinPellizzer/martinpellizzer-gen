    "intro": "Coursetia eriantha, commonly known as the silky coursetia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and small, pale green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Coursetia eriantha is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
