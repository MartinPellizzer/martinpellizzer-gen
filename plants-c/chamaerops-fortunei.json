    "intro": "Chamaerops fortunei, commonly known as the windmill palm, is a hardy, cold-tolerant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a type of palm that grows as a solitary tree with a slender trunk and a crown of stiff, fan-shaped leaves. The plant is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The leaves are often used in traditional crafts, adding to its cultural significance."
