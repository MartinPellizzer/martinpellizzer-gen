    "intro": "Colchicum kurdicum, commonly known as the Kurdish meadow saffron, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and Iran. It belongs to the Colchicaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a unique, spindle-shaped corm that stores nutrients for the next growing season. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that emerge from the base of the plant. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and studied for its potential pharmaceutical applications."
