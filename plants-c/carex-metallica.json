    "intro": "Carex metallica, commonly known as the shining sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly curled, with a metallic sheen that gives it its common name. Carex metallica is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
