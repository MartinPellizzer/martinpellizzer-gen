    "intro": "Catesbaea flaviflora, commonly known as the yellow-flowered satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, warm climate to flourish. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
