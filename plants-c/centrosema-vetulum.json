    "intro": "Centrosema vetulum, commonly known as the smallflower velvetbean, is a leguminous plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, hairy pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. Centrosema vetulum is also valued for its forage qualities and is used in agricultural systems for livestock feed."
