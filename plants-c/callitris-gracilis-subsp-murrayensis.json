    "intro": "Callitris gracilis subsp. murrayensis, commonly known as the Murray cedar, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil, making it a resilient species. The Murray cedar is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is valued for its ecological and historical significance."
