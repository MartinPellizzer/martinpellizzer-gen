    "intro": "Caroxylon glaucum, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. Caroxylon glaucum is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
