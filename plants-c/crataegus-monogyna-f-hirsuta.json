    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy hawthorn, is a compact, shrub-like form of the common hawthorn. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The flowers are typically white or pink, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in late summer. This cultivar is often used in hedgerows and gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
