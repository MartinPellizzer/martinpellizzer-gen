    "intro": "Cousinia quettensis, commonly known as the Quett's cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are often hairy and narrow, reducing water loss in dry climates. Cousinia quettensis produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
