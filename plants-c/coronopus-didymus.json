    "intro": "Coronopus didymus, commonly known as the double crown, is a small annual plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. Its leaves are alternate, linear to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs. The species is often confused with other similar plants due to its modest appearance and short life cycle."
