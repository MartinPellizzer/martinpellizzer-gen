    "intro": "Calanthe citrina, commonly known as the yellow calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically dark green and lance-shaped, arranged in a rosette pattern around the base. Calanthe citrina prefers cool, humid environments and is often found in forest understories where it receives dappled sunlight."
