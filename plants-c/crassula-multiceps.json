    "intro": "Crassula multiceps, commonly known as the Fat Plant or the Jade Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tint, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring. It is drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil and bright, indirect light. Crassula multiceps is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its low maintenance and compact growth habit."
