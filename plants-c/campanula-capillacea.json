    "intro": "Campanula capillacea, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, cylindrical seed capsules that disperse its seeds by wind. Campanula capillacea is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and easy care requirements."
