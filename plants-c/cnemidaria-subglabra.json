    "intro": "Cnemidaria subglabra, commonly known as the smoothleaf cnemidaria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, smooth leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. It is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Cnemidaria subglabra is adapted to arid environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
