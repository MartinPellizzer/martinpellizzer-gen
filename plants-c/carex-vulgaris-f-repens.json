    "intro": "Carex vulgaris f. repens, commonly known as the creeping sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
