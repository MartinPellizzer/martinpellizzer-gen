    "intro": "Crepidorhopalon microcarpaeoides, commonly known as the small-fruited sandwort, is a member of the Montiaceae family. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant characterized by its tiny, clustered leaves and small, greenish flowers. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant's compact structure and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary strategies for survival in nutrient-poor, dry habitats."
