    "intro": "Cistus horrens, commonly known as the Spanish rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features woody stems and gray-green, aromatic leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or coastal environments. Cistus horrens is also valued for its essential oils, which are used in perfumery and traditional medicine."
