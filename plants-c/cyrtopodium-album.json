    "intro": "Cyrtopodium album, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. The plant features a pseudobulb and produces showy, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
