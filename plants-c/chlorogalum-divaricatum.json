    "intro": "Chlorogalum divaricatum, commonly known as the desert spoon, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, spoon-shaped leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces tall, cylindrical flower spikes in shades of white, pink, or purple during the spring. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Chlorogalum divaricatum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
