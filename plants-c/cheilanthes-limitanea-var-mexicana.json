    "intro": "Cheilanthes limitanea var. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent-like leaves. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
