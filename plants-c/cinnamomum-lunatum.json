    "intro": "Cinnamomum lunatum, commonly known as the moon cinnamon, is a rare and lesser-known species of the Cinnamomum genus. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of India and Myanmar. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. Its bark and leaves contain essential oils that are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
