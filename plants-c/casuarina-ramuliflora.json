    "intro": "Casuarina ramuliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub with needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, typically appearing in late winter to early spring. Its seeds are enclosed in woody capsules that split open to release the seeds. Casuarina ramuliflora is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments."
