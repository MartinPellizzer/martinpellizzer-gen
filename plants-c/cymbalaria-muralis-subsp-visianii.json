It is a low-growing herb with a sprawling habit, often found growing on walls, rocks, and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in dry environments. It is a perennial species that thrives in sunny to partially shaded conditions."
