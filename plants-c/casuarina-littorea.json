    "intro": "Casuarina littorea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf she-oak, is a hardy evergreen tree native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It has distinctive needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the twigs, giving it a unique, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Casuarina littorea is well adapted to salty air and sandy soils, making it a common sight in coastal dunes and beaches. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various coastal wildlife."
