    "intro": "Cypripedium vernayi, commonly known as the Vernay's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy purple and white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring rich, organic soil. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, and it produces a single flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
