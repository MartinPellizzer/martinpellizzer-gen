    "intro": "Cremastra appendiculata var. triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed bellflower, is a rare and striking perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, with three prominent lobes on the corolla. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and moist woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive species and is often protected in conservation efforts."
