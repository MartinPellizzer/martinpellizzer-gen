    "intro": "Cactus tuna var. major, commonly known as the giant tuna cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to desert environments. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
