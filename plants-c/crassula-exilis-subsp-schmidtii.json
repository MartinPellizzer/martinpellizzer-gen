It features dense clusters of small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that form a rosette pattern. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
