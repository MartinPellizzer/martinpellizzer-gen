    "intro": "Corybas calopeplos, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a species of orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flower that is typically dark purple or brown in color. The plant grows in rocky or mossy habitats, often in forested areas. Its flowers are pollinated by flies, which are attracted by the flower's strong odor and dark appearance. Corybas calopeplos is a rare and endangered species, with very limited distribution across the South Island of New Zealand."
