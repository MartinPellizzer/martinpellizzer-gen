    "intro": "Celtis mollis, commonly known as the silky elm, is a deciduous tree native to southern and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, round drupes that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in moist, well-drained habitats. Celtis mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat and food for wildlife."
