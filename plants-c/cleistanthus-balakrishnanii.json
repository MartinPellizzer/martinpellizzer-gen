    "intro": "Cleistanthus balakrishnanii, commonly known as the Balakrishnan's cleistanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its unique, spiny leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded forest environments, often growing at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Its botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a distinctive fruit type known as a syncarp. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
