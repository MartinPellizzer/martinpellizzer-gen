    "intro": "Cordia salicifolia, commonly known as the white cordia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Cordia salicifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests."
