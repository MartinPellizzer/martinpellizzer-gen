    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 mauriceanum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like lip. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium micranthum, showcasing a blend of traits from both parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and mountainous regions, preferring cool and humid climates. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with a prominent, showy lip that serves to attract pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and protected areas."
