    "intro": "Cyathea woodlarkensis, commonly known as the Woodlark cycad, is a unique fern-like plant native to the island of Woodlark in the Solomon Islands. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered in a fibrous, spongy layer, which helps it retain moisture in its humid tropical habitat. Cyathea woodlarkensis is notable for its restricted distribution and is considered a rare species due to habitat loss and limited study. Its botanical features make it an important subject for conservation and botanical research."
