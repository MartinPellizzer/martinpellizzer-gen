    "intro": "Caltha leptosepala var. sulfurea, commonly known as the golden bog bean, is a variant of the marsh marigold native to wetland habitats in northern regions. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating in shallow water, aiding in photosynthesis in its aquatic environment. Its flowers consist of numerous stamens surrounding a single pistil, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The variant 'sulfurea' is distinguished by its more intense yellow coloration compared to the typical form."
