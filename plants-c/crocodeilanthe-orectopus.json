    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe orectopus, commonly known as the dragon's tongue fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its striking, elongated fronds that resemble a dragon's tongue. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread along tree trunks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Crocodeilanthe orectopus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
