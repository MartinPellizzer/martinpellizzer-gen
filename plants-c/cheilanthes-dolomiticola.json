    "intro": "Cheilanthes dolomiticola, commonly known as the dolomitic rock fern, is a species of fern native to the limestone and dolomite regions of the southwestern United States. It is a small, terrestrial fern with delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its unique adaptations to arid and rocky environments make it an important indicator species for dolomite habitats. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many areas."
