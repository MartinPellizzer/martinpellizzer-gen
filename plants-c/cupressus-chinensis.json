    "intro": "Cupressus chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The tree has scale-like leaves that are tightly pressed against the branches, giving it a smooth, bark-like appearance. Its cones are small and often persist on the tree for several years. This species is valued for its durable wood and is often used in landscaping and reforestation efforts."
