    "intro": "Carex firmula subsp. firmula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or damp environments such as marshes, wet meadows, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly curled at the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
