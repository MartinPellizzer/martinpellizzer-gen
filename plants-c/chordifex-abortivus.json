    "intro": "Chordifex abortivus, commonly known as the abortive cord fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, cordate (heart-shaped) fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's reproductive structures, known as sori, are arranged along the margins of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
