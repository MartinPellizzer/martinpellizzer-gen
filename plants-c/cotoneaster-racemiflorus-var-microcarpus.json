    "intro": "Cotoneaster racemiflorus var. microcarpus, commonly known as the dwarf cotoneaster, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping for its year-round interest."
