    "intro": "Cyphia bulbosa var. acocksii, commonly known as the Acock's cyphia, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette near the ground. It is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and requires full sun to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
