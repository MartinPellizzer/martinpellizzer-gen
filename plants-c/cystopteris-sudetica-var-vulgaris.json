    "intro": "Cystopteris sudetica var. vulgaris, commonly known as the Sudetic water fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered with a layer of fine, silky hairs. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds."
