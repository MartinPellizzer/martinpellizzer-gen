    "intro": "Caamembeca spectabilis var. amazonensis, commonly known as the Amazonian yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, adding vibrant color to the dense jungle canopy. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates with high rainfall, typical of the Amazon Basin. Its leaves are large, broad, and often have a waxy texture to retain moisture in the tropical environment. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
