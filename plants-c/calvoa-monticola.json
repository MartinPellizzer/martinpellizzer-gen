    "intro": "Calvoa monticola, commonly known as the mountain calvoa, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific high-altitude regions. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Calvoa monticola thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
