    "intro": "Cyphia campestris, commonly known as the field cyphia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Cyphia campestris is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions as a garden plant."
