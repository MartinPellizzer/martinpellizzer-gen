    "intro": "Cyathea alsophiliformis, commonly known as the Alsop's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its fronds are often used in traditional M\u0101ori practices. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological significance in its native habitat."
