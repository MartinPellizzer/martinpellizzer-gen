    "intro": "Cymbopogon dieterlenii, commonly known as the Dieterlen's citron grass, is a tropical perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often overlooked due to its grassy appearance. While not widely cultivated for commercial purposes, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles. Its growth habits and adaptations make it a valuable subject for studies on tropical flora."
