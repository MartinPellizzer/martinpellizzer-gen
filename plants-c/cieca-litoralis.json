    "intro": "Cieca litoralis, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to coastal areas of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils near the shoreline, where it can access both water and prey. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its stems remain above the water surface. Despite its carnivorous nature, it plays a role in nutrient cycling in coastal ecosystems."
