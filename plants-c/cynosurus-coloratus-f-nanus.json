    "intro": "Cynosurus coloratus f. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf pink hairgrass, is a compact, low-growing grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features fine, silver-gray blades that are densely tufted, giving it a soft, mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, pale pink or white spikelets that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral touch. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
