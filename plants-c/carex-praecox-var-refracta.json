    "intro": "Carex praecox var. refracta, commonly known as early sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually a deep green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas. The species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in water gardens."
