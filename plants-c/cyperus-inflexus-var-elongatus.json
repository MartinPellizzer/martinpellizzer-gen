    "intro": "Cyperus inflexus var. elongatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and distinctive inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets that are often submerged or partially submerged in water."
