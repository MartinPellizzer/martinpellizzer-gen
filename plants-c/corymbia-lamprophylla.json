    "intro": "Corymbia lamprophylla, commonly known as the silky gum, is a species of flowering tree native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences, typically blooming during late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a silvery-blue underside, contributing to its ornamental value. The silky gum is often found in coastal and lowland forests, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
