It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy species often found in high-altitude ecosystems."
