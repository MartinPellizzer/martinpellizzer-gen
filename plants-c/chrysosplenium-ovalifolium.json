    "intro": "Chrysosplenium ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaf chrysosplenium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are oval-shaped and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
