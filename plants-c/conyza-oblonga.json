    "intro": "Conyza oblonga, commonly known as roughleaf fleabane, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Conyza oblonga is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a source of nectar for pollinators."
