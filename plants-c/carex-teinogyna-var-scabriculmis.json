    "intro": "Carex teinogyna var. scabriculmis, commonly known as the scabrous-ribbed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, three-ranked flowers, which are wind-pollinated. The leaves are usually scabrous or rough to the touch, giving the variety its common name."
