    "intro": "Combretum ternatum, commonly known as the slender flame bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in summer. These flowers are followed by small, three-lobed fruits that split open to release seeds. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
