    "intro": "Cleistes fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant cleistocarp, is a rare and unusual flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Oenotheraceae family and is characterized by its unique, closed flowers that remain tightly sealed until they mature. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that emit a sweet, spicy fragrance, attracting specific pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Cleistes fragrans is considered an endangered species in many regions."
