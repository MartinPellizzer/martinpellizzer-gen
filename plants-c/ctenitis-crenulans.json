    "intro": "Ctenitis crenulans, commonly known as the serrated shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically divided into segments with a serrated edge, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's rhizome is creeping and produces roots that help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces."
