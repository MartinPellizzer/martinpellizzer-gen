    "intro": "Carex tenuis var. brevifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, bogs, and wet meadows. It produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers in the summer, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex tenuis var. brevifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
