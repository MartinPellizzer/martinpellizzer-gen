    "intro": "Clutia pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved clutia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its woody stem is often branched and can grow up to several meters in height. Clutia pachyphylla is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
