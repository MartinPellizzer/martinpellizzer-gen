    "intro": "Cartrema, commonly known as the \"crown of the forest,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that resemble a hand, and its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. Cartrema thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
