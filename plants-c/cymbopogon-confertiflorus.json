    "intro": "Cymbopogon confertiflorus, commonly known as the dense-flowered grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant features narrow, sword-shaped leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green flowers. It is well adapted to warm climates and can tolerate a range of soil types. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ornamental landscaping and for erosion control."
