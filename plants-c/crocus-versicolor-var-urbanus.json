    "intro": "Crocus versicolor var. urbanus, commonly known as the urban crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features striking, often variegated flowers in shades of yellow, white, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, globe-shaped bulbs that help it spread vegetatively. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for urban gardens and rockeries. Its adaptability to disturbed soils has led to its naturalization in urban environments."
