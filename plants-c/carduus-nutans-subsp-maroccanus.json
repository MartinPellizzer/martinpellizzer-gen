It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and deeply lobed, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. This subspecies is closely related to other thistles in the Asteraceae family and shares similar ecological adaptations."
