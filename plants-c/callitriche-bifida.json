    "intro": "Callitriche bifida, commonly known as the divided water-star, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments. It typically grows in shallow waters and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into two lobes. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its stems are usually slender and branched, allowing it to spread across the water's surface. Callitriche bifida plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
