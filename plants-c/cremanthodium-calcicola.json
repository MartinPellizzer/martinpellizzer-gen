    "intro": "Cremanthodium calcicola, commonly known as the limestone starflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or alpine meadows. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
