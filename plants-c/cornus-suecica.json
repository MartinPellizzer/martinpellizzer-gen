    "intro": "Cornus suecica, commonly known as Swedish dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to northern Europe. It features showy, white bracts that appear in late spring, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall. Its fruit is a red, fleshy drupe that attracts birds. Cornus suecica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist, woodland environments."
