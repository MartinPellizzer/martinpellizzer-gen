    "intro": "Cyclosorus megaphyllus, commonly known as the giant cyclosorus, is a rare and fascinating member of the fern family. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can reach several meters in length, making it one of the most striking ferns in the genus. The plant exhibits a unique frond structure with a central axis and multiple pinnae, each bearing smaller, tooth-like divisions. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
