    "intro": "Carex digitata f. pallens, commonly known as the pale-flowered basket sedge, is a variant of the basket sedge species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its clumping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to cream-colored flowers, distinguishing it from the typical green flowers of the species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This ornamental plant is valued for its elegant appearance and ability to tolerate wet conditions, making it suitable for water garden settings."
