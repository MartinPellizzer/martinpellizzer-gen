    "intro": "Carduus setosus, commonly known as the hispid thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a tall, branching stem that produces purple to pink flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry, open habitats. Its leaves are covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which give it its common name. The flowers are visited by various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
