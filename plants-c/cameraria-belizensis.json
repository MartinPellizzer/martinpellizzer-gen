    "intro": "Cameraria belizensis, commonly known as the Belize leafminer, is a species of moth belonging to the family Lyonetiidae. It is characterized by its small size and distinctive larval feeding habits, which involve mining within the leaves of its host plants. The plant it primarily affects is the ceiba tree, *Ceiba pentandra*, which is native to Central and South America. The larvae create serpentine tunnels within the leaf tissue, causing visible damage that can impact the tree's health. This species is of interest to botanists and entomologists due to its specific ecological interactions and potential role in forest ecosystems."
