    "intro": "Clinostemon, commonly known as the \"frost plant\" or \"desert bell,\" is a member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features upright, branched stems covered in dense, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers, which range from white to pink, are tubular and attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Clinostemon is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
