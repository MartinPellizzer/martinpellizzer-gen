    "intro": "Cheirostylis kanashiroi, commonly known as the Kanashiro's torch orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, torch-like inflorescence that bears numerous small, brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, thriving in the understory where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its flowers, often in shades of red and orange, are adapted for pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
