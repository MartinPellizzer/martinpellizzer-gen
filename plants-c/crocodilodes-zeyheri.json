    "intro": "Crocodilodes zeyheri, commonly known as the Zeyher's crocodile plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual element. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss. Crocodilodes zeyheri is well-suited for rock gardens or xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
