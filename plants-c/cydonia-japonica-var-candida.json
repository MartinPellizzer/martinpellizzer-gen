    "intro": "Cydonia japonica var. candida, commonly known as the white Japanese quince, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan and Korea. It produces fragrant, white flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant's fruit, which is typically yellow or orange, is harvested in late autumn and is used in traditional Asian cuisine. The leaves are ovate and have a slightly serrated margin, while the bark is smooth and grayish-brown. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and its historical use in herbal medicine."
