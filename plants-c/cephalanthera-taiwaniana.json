    "intro": "Cephalanthera taiwaniana, commonly known as the Taiwan lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a deep violet or purple coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, thriving in the undergrowth of subtropical or temperate forests. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological complexity. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
