    "intro": "Cypripedium occidentale, commonly known as the western lady's slipper, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers with a pouch-like lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
