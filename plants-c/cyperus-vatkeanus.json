    "intro": "Cyperus vatkeanus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense stands in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces three-sided, fibrous seeds. Cyperus vatkeanus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
