    "intro": "Carex retrocurva var. copulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedges, is a perennial sedge native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, cylindrical inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and pond edges. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and small, wind-pollinated flowers arranged in spikelets. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
