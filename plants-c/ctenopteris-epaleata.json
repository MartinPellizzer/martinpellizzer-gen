    "intro": "Ctenopteris epaleata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Ctenopteris epaleata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and air-purifying qualities."
