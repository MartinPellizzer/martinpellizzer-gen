    "intro": "Callista hornei, commonly known as the Horne's callista, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rutaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of South Africa, where it thrives in sandy soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the winter months. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slight waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Callista hornei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
