    "intro": "Cissus antandroy, commonly known as the Madagascar grapevine, is a climbing plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its tendrils that help it climb and spread across surfaces. The plant has opposite, simple, and usually heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, white hairs. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are followed by clusters of berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Cissus antandroy is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments."
