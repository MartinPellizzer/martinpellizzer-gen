It is characterized by its alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its fruits are tiny, dry capsules that release seeds when mature. Clidemia octona is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
