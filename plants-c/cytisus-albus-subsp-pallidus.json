    "intro": "Cytisus albus subsp. pallidus, commonly known as the pale broom, is a flowering shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and are generally pale green in color. This subspecies is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature and attractive floral display."
