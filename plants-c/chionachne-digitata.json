    "intro": "Chionachne digitata, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a common component of tundra and mountain ecosystems. Chionachne digitata plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife."
