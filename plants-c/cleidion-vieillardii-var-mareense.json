    "intro": "Cleidion vieillardii var. mareense, commonly known as the Mare's Milk Tree, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has a distinctive milky sap, which is a key feature in its identification and has been noted for its medicinal properties in traditional use. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal or lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
