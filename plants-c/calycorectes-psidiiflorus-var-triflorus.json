    "intro": "Calycorectes psidiiflorus var. triflorus, commonly known as the three-flowered calycorectes, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three distinct leaflets. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure botanical specimen."
