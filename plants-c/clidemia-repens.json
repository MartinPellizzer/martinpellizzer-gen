    "intro": "Clidemia repens, commonly known as groundsel or false dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces, and it produces small yellow flowers that develop into white, cottony seeds. Clidemia repens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streambanks. It is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it an invasive species in some regions."
