    "intro": "Cereus pectinifer, commonly known as the feathered cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, a trait common among many cacti. Its stems are covered in short, stiff spines, and it has a distinctive appearance with its branching structure. This plant is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
