    "intro": "Cyclogramma neoauriculata, commonly known as the auriculate cyclogramma, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, often appearing in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are typically hairy and have a unique auriculate base. Cyclogramma neoauriculata is often found in dry, open habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
