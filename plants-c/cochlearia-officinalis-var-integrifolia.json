    "intro": "Cochlearia officinalis var. integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth coastal carnation, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its striking, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically basal, spoon-shaped, and have a smooth, waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in coastal environments. This variety is distinguished by its entire leaf margins, contrasting with the toothed leaves of other Cochlearia species. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds."
