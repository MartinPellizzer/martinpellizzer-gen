    "intro": "Cybianthus duidae, commonly known as the Duidae's cybianthus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers display a range of colors from white to pale yellow. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cybianthus duidae is considered a critically endangered species."
