    "intro": "Comesperma ericinum f. esulifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved form of the coastal wattle, is a variant of the coastal wattle species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a dull green and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and is adapted to salt-laden winds and coastal conditions. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal landscaping."
