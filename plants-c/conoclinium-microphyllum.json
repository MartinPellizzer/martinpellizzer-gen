    "intro": "Conoclinium microphyllum, commonly known as the Mexican mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. These flowers are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
