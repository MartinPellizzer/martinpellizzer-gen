    "intro": "Cymbopetalum hintonii subsp. septentrionale, commonly known as the northern flame vine, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a dramatic display during the flowering season. The plant has slender, climbing stems that often require support as they grow, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
