    "intro": "Clematis tenuifolia, commonly known as the slenderleaf clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It features slender, twining stems that can grow up to 15 feet in length, often climbing or trailing along supports. The plant produces small, delicate white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by small, dry fruits. Its foliage is finely divided, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that give it a graceful appearance. Clematis tenuifolia is relatively low maintenance and thrives in partial shade to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners."
