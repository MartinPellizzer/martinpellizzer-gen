It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like structures that split open when mature. Crotalaria cinerea is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
