    "intro": "Castanea edonii, commonly known as the Edonian chestnut, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and other chestnut species. The plant is characterized by its deciduous habit, with palmately lobed leaves and small, spiny fruits that contain edible nuts. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered a valuable species for ecological and botanical study."
