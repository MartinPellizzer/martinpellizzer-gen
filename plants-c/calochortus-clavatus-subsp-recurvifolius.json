    "intro": "Calochortus clavatus subsp. recurvifolius, commonly known as the recurved globemallow, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is native to California and is characterized by its distinctive, globe-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The subspecies is distinguished by its recurved (bent backward) leaf tips and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the typical form. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
