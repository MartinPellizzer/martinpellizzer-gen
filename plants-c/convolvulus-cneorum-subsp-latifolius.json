    "intro": "Convolvulus cneorum subsp. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, tubular, violet or pink flowers that bloom in clusters. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
