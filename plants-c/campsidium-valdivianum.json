    "intro": "Campsidium valdivianum, commonly known as the Valdivian candlewood, is a South American shrub belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, candle-like stems and opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is typically found in the understory of cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
