    "intro": "Cirsium horridulum var. vittatum, commonly known as the purple thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, purple-tinged leaves and large, showy purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which provide a protective barrier against herbivores. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
