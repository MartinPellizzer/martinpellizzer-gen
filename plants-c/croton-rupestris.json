    "intro": "Croton rupestris, commonly known as the rock croton, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of South Africa. It features distinctive, often colorful, palmate leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental foliage, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
