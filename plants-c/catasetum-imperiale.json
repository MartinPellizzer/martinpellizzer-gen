    "intro": "Catasetum imperiale, commonly known as the imperial cattleya, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, large flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter, often featuring vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its inflorescence consists of a raceme of showy, fragrant blooms, and it produces a unique structure called a \"catasetum,\" which is a specialized pollen presenter. The orchid prefers warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
