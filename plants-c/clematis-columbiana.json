    "intro": "Clematis columbiana, commonly known as the Vancouver clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in cooler climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in native plant gardens."
