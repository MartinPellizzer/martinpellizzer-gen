    "intro": "Cynanchum virginicum, commonly known as Virginia snakeroot, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by follicles that release seeds with silky hairs. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Due to its historical use in traditional medicine, it has also been the subject of modern pharmacological research."
