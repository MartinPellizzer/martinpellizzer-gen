    "intro": "Cespedesia sprucei, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage that turns coppery in the fall. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover and erosion control plant."
