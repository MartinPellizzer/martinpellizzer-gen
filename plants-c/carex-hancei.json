    "intro": "Carex hancei, commonly known as Hance's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to East Asia, particularly China, and thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces dense clusters of grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Carex hancei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
