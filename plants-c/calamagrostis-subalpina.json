    "intro": "Calamagrostis subalpina, commonly known as the alpine sweet grass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and tundra environments. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often silver-white in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. It produces panicles of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are wind-pollinated. Calamagrostis subalpina is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in alpine and subalpine habitats."
