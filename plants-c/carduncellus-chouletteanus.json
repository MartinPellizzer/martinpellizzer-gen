    "intro": "Carduncellus chouletteanus, commonly known as the Choulettean thistle, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and has adapted to poor soil conditions. Its botanical features include a thick, waxy cuticle on the leaves to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
