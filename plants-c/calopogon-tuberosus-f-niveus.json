It is characterized by its pale white to cream-colored flowers, which stand out against its grass-like foliage. This orchid is native to the eastern United States, particularly in wetland habitats. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swampy areas. The plant is notable for its delicate appearance and its role in supporting local pollinators."
