    "intro": "Codiaeum pentzii, commonly known as the flame maple or croton, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful leaves that display shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with intricate patterns. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its striking foliage rather than its flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Codiaeum pentzii is popular as a ornamental plant due to its eye-catching appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
