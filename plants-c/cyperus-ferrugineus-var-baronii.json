The plant has slender, grass-like stems with small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a rusty-colored bloom. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
