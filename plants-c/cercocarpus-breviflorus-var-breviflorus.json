    "intro": "Cercocarpus breviflorus var. breviflorus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved curlleaf mountain-mahogany, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces hard, woody fruits that contain a single seed, typical of the Rhamnaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
