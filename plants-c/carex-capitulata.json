    "intro": "Carex capitulata, commonly known as the purple stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically purple or green, giving it its common name. Carex capitulata thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
