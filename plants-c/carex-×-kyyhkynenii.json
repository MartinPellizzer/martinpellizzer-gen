    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 kyyhkynenii, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Carex ciliacea and Carex kobomulgensis, characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly curled, with a dark green coloration. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage, making it a subtle yet resilient wetland plant."
