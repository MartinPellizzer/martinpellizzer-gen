    "intro": "Carex ouachitana, commonly known as Ouachita sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forested areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
