    "intro": "Craibia atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic craibia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of West Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy soils along the Atlantic coast. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly rough texture. Craibia atlantica is adapted to tolerate salt spray and sandy conditions, making it a resilient species in its natural habitat."
