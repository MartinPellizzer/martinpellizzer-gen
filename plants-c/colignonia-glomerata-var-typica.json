    "intro": "Colignonia glomerata var. typica, commonly known as the clustered colignonia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, spherical inflorescences that bear small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are simple and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution."
