    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 luridum, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy pink or orange pouch-shaped flower, which is adapted to attract specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a rhizomatous root system. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, large flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
