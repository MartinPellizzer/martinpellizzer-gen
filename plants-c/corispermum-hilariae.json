    "intro": "Corispermum hilariae, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its seeds are encased in a hard, dry fruit called a capsule. Corispermum hilariae is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments through its deep root system and water-conserving mechanisms."
