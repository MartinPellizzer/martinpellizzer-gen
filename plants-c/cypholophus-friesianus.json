    "intro": "Cypholophus friesianus, commonly known as the Friesian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the island of Friesland in the Netherlands. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Cypholophus friesianus is a rare species, listed as endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
