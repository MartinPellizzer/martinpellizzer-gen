    "intro": "Coronilla hispanica, commonly known as Spanish crownflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Its small, trifoliate leaves and pea-like flowers make it easily identifiable, while its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant. It is also cultivated as a forage plant for livestock in some regions."
