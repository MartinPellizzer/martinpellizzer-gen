The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color, which are followed by dry, hard fruits. It is well adapted to harsh environments, showing tolerance to drought and poor soil conditions. This species is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is an important component of the local flora in its native range."
