It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and features bright yellow flowers. Its seeds are encased in slender, cylindrical pods, and the plant is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural settings. However, it can be toxic to livestock due to the presence of pyrrolizidine alkaloids."
