    "intro": "Cuscuta calyptrata, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has a vine-like structure that allows it to\u7f20\u7ed5 and attach to various host plants. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, facilitating its spread to new locations. It is often found growing on crops such as soybeans and cotton, causing significant agricultural damage. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked."
