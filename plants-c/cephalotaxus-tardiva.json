    "intro": "Cephalotaxus tardiva, commonly known as the late-flowering Chinese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to China. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant in temperate climates. Due to its rarity and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and protected areas."
