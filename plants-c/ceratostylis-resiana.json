    "intro": "Ceratostylis resiana, commonly known as the Resin Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial herb with a short, creeping rhizome and erect, branching stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a distinctive, club-shaped spur. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The flowers are pollinated primarily by small insects, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
