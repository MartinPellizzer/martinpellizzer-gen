    "intro": "Castilleja katakyptusa, commonly known as the Sierra redshank, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in open coniferous forests and meadows, often forming dense colonies. Its roots are specialized to attach to the roots of other plants, drawing nutrients from them. Castilleja katakyptusa plays a role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
