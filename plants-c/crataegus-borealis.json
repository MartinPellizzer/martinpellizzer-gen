    "intro": "Crataegus borealis, commonly known as the northern hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swampy areas, along streambanks, and in shaded woodlands. The plant produces white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are oval with serrated edges, and it has a dense, rounded form. Crataegus borealis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland ecosystems."
