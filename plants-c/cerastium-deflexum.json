It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that bear small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are typically arranged in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Cerastium deflexum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
