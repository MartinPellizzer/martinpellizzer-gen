    "intro": "Carex supina var. supina, commonly known as the prostrate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant forms dense, low-growing clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are usually borne on short, leafy stems. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
