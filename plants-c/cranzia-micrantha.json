    "intro": "Cranzia micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered cranza, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Cranzia micrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
