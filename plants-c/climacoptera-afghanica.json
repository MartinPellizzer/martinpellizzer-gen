    "intro": "Climacoptera afghanica, commonly known as the Afghan mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Afghanistan. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Climacoptera afghanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a similar climate."
