It is characterized by its thorny branches, elliptical leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white to pink flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are edible but often have a tart flavor. Botter's hawthorn is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species found in rocky soils and open woodlands."
