    "intro": "Caragana pruinosa, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, oval leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Caragana pruinosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in arid conditions."
