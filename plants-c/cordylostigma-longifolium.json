    "intro": "Cordylostigma longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved cordylostigma, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, blooming during the late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
