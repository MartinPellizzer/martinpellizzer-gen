    "intro": "Cedrus libani f. glaucissima, commonly known as the Blue Atlas Cedar, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Atlas Cedar. It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage, which results from a dense layer of epicuticular wax on the leaves. This form is native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Mediterranean, particularly in Lebanon and Turkey. The tree has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Its unique appearance makes it a prized specimen in horticulture, though it is challenging to cultivate outside its native range."
