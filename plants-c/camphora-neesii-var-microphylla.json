    "intro": "Camphora neesii var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved camphor tree, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that are smaller than those of the typical camphor tree. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. The tree is valued for its aromatic wood and historical use in traditional medicine."
