    "intro": "Ceratotheca triloba, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small, deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, spiny capsules that contain its seeds. Its hard, dense wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant is adapted to arid environments and plays an important role in local ecosystems."
