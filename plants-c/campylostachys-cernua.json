    "intro": "Campylostachys cernua, commonly known as the creeping bluebell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a soft, velvety texture. The creeping bluebell is well adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodland environments."
