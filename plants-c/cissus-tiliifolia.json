    "intro": "Cissus tiliifolia, commonly known as the Indian gooseberry vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It features heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that resemble gooseberries. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb trees and other structures. Cissus tiliifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
