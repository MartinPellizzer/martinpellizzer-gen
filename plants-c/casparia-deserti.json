    "intro": "Casparia deserti, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration. Casparia deserti plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert insects."
