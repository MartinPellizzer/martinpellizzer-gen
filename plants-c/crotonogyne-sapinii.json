    "intro": "Crotonogyne sapinii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre croton, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
