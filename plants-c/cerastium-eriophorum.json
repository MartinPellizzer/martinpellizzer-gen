It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate habit, with small, rounded leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, producing small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Cerastium eriophorum is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is an important component of early successional plant communities."
