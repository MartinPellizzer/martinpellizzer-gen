    "intro": "Chesneya potaninii, commonly known as the Potanin's chesneya, is a unique member of the Bromeliaceae family, native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small, terrestrial bromeliad that typically grows in shaded, moist environments within cloud forests. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater, a common adaptation in its native habitat. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of red or orange, adding visual interest. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
