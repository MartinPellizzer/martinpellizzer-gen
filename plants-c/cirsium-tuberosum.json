    "intro": "Cirsium tuberosum, commonly known as the globe thistle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spherical, spiky blue or purple flower heads that resemble a globe, which are composed of numerous small, stiff bracts. The plant has a robust root system and thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cirsium tuberosum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
