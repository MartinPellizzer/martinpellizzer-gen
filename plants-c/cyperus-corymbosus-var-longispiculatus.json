The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often subtended by long, bristly bracts, giving it its distinctive appearance. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its botanical features make it identifiable in wetland ecosystems and useful for ecological studies."
