It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in aquatic environments. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
