    "intro": "Cynosurus elegans var. gracilis, commonly known as slender silky grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features fine, slender blades that are often covered in a silky, hairy texture, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically forms dense mats or tufts, with flowering spikes that emerge in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a soft, bluish-green hue, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
