    "intro": "Cedrus atlantica, commonly known as the Atlas cedar, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are arranged in flattened sprays. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been cultivated in botanical gardens and landscapes around the world."
