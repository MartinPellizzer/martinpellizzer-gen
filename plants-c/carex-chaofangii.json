It is native to China and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
