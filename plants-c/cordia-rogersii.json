    "intro": "Cordia rogersii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its showy yellow or orange flowers bloom in summer. Cordia rogersii produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature."
