    "intro": "Ctenitis securidiformis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its sword-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizome producing both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in moist, shaded environments."
