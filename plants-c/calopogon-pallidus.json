    "intro": "Calopogon pallidus, commonly known as the pale bog orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the wetlands of North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor peat bogs, often growing in shallow water or moist soil. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important indicator species for healthy wetland ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions."
