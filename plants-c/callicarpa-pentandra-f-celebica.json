It is characterized by its clusters of small, bright purple berries that appear in the fall. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with slightly serrated edges and emits a subtle, sweet fragrance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. The berries are edible but are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife rather than humans."
