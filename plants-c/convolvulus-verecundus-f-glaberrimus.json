    "intro": "Convolvulus verecundus f. glaberrimus, commonly known as the smooth convolvulus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the bindweed family, Convolvulaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and usually pubescent, while the flowers are funnel-shaped with five petals. This variety is distinguished by its reduced pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to other forms of the species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
