    "intro": "Chrysanthemum perpusillum, commonly known as the dwarf chrysanthemum, is a compact, flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 15 to 30 centimeters, featuring small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are gray-green in color, adding a delicate texture to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its botanical characteristics make it both ornamental and relatively easy to cultivate in mild climates."
