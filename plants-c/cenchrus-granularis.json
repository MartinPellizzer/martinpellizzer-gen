    "intro": "Cenchrus granularis, commonly known as roughhairs grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in dry conditions, making it a hardy ornamental and forage plant. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, contributing to its ecological significance in arid environments."
