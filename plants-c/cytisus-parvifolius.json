    "intro": "Cytisus parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months, which are characteristic of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and have a leathery texture, while its root system is adapted to poor, sandy soils. Cytisus parvifolius is often found in open woodlands and along coastal areas, where it thrives in full sun."
