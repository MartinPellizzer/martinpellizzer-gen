    "intro": "Ctenitis loheri, commonly known as the Loher's sea holly, is a rare and distinctive marine plant found in specific coastal regions. It belongs to the family Ctenophyceae and is characterized by its unique, branching structure that resembles a sea fan. The plant's primary feature is its delicate, feather-like filaments that extend from a central axis, giving it a feathery appearance. It thrives in shallow, turbulent waters where it can anchor itself to rocky substrates. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Ctenitis loheri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
