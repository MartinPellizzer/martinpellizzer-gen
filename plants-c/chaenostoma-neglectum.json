    "intro": "Chaenostoma neglectum, commonly known as the neglected water plant, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, oval leaves that are usually submerged or partially emergent. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late summer. Chaenostoma neglectum plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems but is valued in some regions for its ornamental appeal."
