    "intro": "Corydalis duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant features slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
