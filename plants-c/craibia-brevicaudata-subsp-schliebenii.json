    "intro": "Craibia brevicaudata subsp. schliebenii, commonly known as the Schlieben's craibia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring elongated, lanceolate leaves with a rough, pubescent surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or white, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its growth habit is shrub-like, with a compact form and dense foliage. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native range."
