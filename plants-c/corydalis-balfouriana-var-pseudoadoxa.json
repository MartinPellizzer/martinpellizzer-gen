    "intro": "Corydalis balfouriana var. pseudoadoxa, commonly known as the Balfour's corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces slender, erect stems that often bear clusters of small, tubular flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
