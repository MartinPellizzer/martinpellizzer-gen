    "intro": "Cypripedium passerinum var. minganense, commonly known as the Mingan lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the boreal forests of eastern Canada. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and a tall, slender flowering stem that bears a loose cluster of pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. It is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is essential for its survival. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its continued existence."
