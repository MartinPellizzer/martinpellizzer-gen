    "intro": "Coryphantha vivipara var. rosea, commonly known as the Pink Ghost Cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the United States, particularly in Texas and New Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often tinged with a pink or reddish hue, especially in the varietal form rosea. The plant produces vibrant orange to yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its stems are covered in small, white to pale blue tubercles, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
