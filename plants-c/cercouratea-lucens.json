    "intro": "Cercouratea lucens, commonly known as the golden flame fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, yellowish-green fronds that emit a subtle luminescence in low light conditions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce aerial roots for attachment to trees or rocky surfaces. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. Cercouratea lucens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique aesthetic and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
