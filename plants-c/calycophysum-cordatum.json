    "intro": "Calycophysum cordatum, commonly known as the heart-shaped liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales. It is characterized by its leafy thallus, which is typically heart-shaped, hence its common name. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having structures called rhizoids for anchoring and nutrient absorption. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on rocks. Calycophysum cordatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
