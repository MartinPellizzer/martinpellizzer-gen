    "intro": "Convolvulus paniculatus, commonly known as the clustered morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in the morning. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in coastal and sandy regions. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
