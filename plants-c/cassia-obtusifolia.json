It features compound leaves with rounded or broadly ovate leaflets that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in the spring. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that mature in the fall. Cassia obtusifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
