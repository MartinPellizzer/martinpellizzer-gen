    "intro": "Centrosema coriaceum, commonly known as the hairy beggar's tick, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and pastures. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment. The seeds are encased in a hard, hairy capsule that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing."
