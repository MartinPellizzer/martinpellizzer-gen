    "intro": "Cerastium spurium, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland edges and garden beds. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
