    "intro": "Ctenopteris discolor, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea holly, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and leathery fronds that often have a bluish-green or silver-gray hue. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal or moist forest areas. Ctenopteris discolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
