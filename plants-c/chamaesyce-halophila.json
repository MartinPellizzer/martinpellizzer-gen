    "intro": "Chamaesyce halophila, commonly known as sea hibiscus, is a halophytic plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in saline and arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in the summer months. Its stems are often prostrate or creeping, forming dense mats that stabilize coastal soils. Chamaesyce halophila plays a vital role in preventing erosion and supporting coastal biodiversity."
