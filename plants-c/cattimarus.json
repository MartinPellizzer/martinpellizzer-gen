    "intro": "Cattimarus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its striking, pale blue or white petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant produces small, yellow berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Cattimarus thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of ongoing scientific study."
