    "intro": "Cacalia petasites, commonly known as the European buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive cup-shaped center, which are often mistaken for true buttercups. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring well-drained soil. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Cacalia petasites is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain habitats."
