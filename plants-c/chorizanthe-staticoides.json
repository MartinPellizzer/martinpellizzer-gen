    "intro": "Chorizanthe staticoides, commonly known as the sticky cholla, is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, featuring dense clusters of spiny stems. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and the stems are covered in a sticky resin that helps deter herbivores. This hardy plant is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
