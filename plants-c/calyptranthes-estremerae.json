    "intro": "Calyptranthes estremerae, commonly known as the Estremera calyptranthe, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of western Ecuador. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,200 and 2,000 meters, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its misty habitat. Calyptranthes estremerae is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
