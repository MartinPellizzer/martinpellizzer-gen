    "intro": "Carex flava var. barrerae, commonly known as the yellow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Central America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is noted for its yellowish-green foliage and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance."
