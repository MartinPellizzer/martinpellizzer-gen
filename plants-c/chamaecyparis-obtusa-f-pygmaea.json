    "intro": "Chamaecyparis obtusa f. pygmaea, commonly known as the Japanese dwarf cedar, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen conifer. It features scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, giving it a fine-textured appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It is native to Japan and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils with partial to full sun. Due to its ornamental value and compact size, it is often used in gardens and as a specimen plant."
