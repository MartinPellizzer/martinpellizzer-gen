    "intro": "Cipadessa baccifera, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark and aerial roots that help it survive in saline environments. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by water, aiding in its propagation along shorelines. Its leaves are alternate and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Cipadessa baccifera plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitats for various marine and terrestrial species."
