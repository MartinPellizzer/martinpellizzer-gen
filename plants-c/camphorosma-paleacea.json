    "intro": "Camphorosma paleacea, commonly known as the paleaceus camphorosma, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and a waxy leaf surface to reduce water loss. Camphorosma paleacea is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties."
