    "intro": "Corunastylis nigricans, commonly known as the black-stemmed star sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. Its dark green foliage and compact growth habit make it a suitable candidate for ornamental use in moist, shaded garden environments. Corunastylis nigricans thrives in wetlands and marshy areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
