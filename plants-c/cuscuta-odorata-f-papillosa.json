    "intro": "Cuscuta odorata f. papillosa, commonly known as the fragrant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that twine around its host plants. The plant is characterized by its papillate (bumpy) structures on its stems, which are a distinguishing feature of this particular form. It is often found growing on a variety of plants, including agricultural crops and ornamental species. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to its host plants if left unchecked."
