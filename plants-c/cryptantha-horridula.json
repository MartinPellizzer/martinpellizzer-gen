    "intro": "Cryptantha horridula, commonly known as the hairy cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or through animal activity. Cryptantha horridula is often found in dry, rocky soils and is well-suited to desert and foothill habitats."
