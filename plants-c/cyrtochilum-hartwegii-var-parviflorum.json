    "intro": "Cyrtochilum hartwegii var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered cyclochilum, is a species of orchid native to the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces pseudobulbs that store water, aiding in its survival in high-altitude environments. It prefers cool, humid conditions and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
