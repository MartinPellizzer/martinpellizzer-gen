    "intro": "Capnorchis occidentalis, commonly known as the western capnorchis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in North America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands or stream sides. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, which helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
