    "intro": "Columnea oblanceolata, commonly known as the red-flowered candelabra, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its cascading clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea oblanceolata is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its vibrant blooms and compact growth habit."
