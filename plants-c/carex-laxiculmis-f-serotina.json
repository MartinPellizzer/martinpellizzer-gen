    "intro": "Carex laxiculmis f. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which typically bloom later in the growing season. The plant thrives in moist to wet environments, such as wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. The inflorescence consists of multiple spikelets, with the flowers being small and usually green or brown in color."
