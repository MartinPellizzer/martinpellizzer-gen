    "intro": "Cyperus conicus, commonly known as the spiky flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and a single, spiky flower spike that emerges from the base of the plant. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often near water bodies. Its inflorescence consists of small, densely packed spikelets that are often surrounded by bracts. Cyperus conicus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
