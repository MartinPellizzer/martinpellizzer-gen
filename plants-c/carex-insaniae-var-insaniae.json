    "intro": "Carex insaniae var. insaniae, commonly known as the insane sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or wetlands. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
