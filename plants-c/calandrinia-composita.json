    "intro": "Calandrinia composita, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvacae family and is characterized by its small, showy pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Calandrinia composita is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
