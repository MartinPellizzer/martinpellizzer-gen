    "intro": "Cheilanthes davallioides, commonly known as the mountain hawksbeard, is a terrestrial fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with dense, glossy, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green to bluish-green in color. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. The fronds are covered with tiny, scale-like structures that help reduce water loss, adapting it to its often arid or semi-arid habitat."
