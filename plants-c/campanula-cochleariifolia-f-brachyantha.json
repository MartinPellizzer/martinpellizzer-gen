    "intro": "Campanula cochleariifolia f. brachyantha, commonly known as the compact bellflower, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features showy, bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette and are hairy, with a slightly wavy margin. This cultivar is prized for its compact form and vibrant flowers, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
