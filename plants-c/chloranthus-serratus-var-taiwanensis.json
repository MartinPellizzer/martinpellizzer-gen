    "intro": "Chloranthus serratus var. taiwanensis, commonly known as the Taiwan serrated chloranthus, is a rare flowering plant native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
