    "intro": "Caltha pygmaea, commonly known as lesser marsh marigold, is a small perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in poorly drained soils. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers in early spring. Its flowers are often surrounded by several sepals that are mistaken for petals. Caltha pygmaea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
