It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous stem and grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in summer, which are followed by small, round, yellow berries. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it a valued plant in local cuisines. Caustis hexandra is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
