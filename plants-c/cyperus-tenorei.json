    "intro": "Cyperus tenorei, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along water bodies, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its slender, grass-like stems are often clustered at the base, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Cyperus tenorei is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to tolerate waterlogged soils."
