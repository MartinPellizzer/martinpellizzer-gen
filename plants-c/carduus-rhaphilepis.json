    "intro": "Carduus rhaphilepis, commonly known as the narrowleaf thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust, upright stem covered in dense, spiny leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces purple to pink flowers in a spherical cluster, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are often covered in a white, powdery substance called bloom, which helps reduce water loss. Carduus rhaphilepis is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
