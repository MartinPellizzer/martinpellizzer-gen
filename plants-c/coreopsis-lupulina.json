    "intro": "Coreopsis lupulina, commonly known as the yellow ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are tubular at the base and open into a flat, disk-like shape, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Coreopsis lupulina is often found in moist to wet habitats, including meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks."
