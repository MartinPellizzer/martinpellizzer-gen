    "intro": "Cleistocactus fieldianus, commonly known as the Field's close-cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white or grayish hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that open only at night, a trait known as nocturnal anthesis. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and growth habits, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
