    "intro": "Cestrum cuspidatum, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, dark seeds. Cestrum cuspidatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
