    "intro": "Cyrtogonium sinuosum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic life. Cyrtogonium sinuosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits in aquatic ecosystems."
