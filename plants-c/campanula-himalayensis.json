    "intro": "Campanula himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and East Asia. It is characterized by its bell-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
