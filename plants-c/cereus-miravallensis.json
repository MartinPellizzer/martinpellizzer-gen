    "intro": "Cereus miravallensis, commonly known as the Miravallensis Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, unbranched stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a thick, fleshy stem adapted for water storage. This species is well-suited to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
