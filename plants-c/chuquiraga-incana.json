    "intro": "Chuquiraga incana, commonly known as the Andean burr bush, is a shrub native to South America, particularly the Andean regions of Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces distinctive, hooked bracts that help in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Its botanical features make it an important species in its native ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
