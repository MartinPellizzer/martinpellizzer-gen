    "intro": "Catasetum cliftonii, commonly known as Clifton's orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers. The plant produces a unique structure called a \"catasetum,\" which is a specialized pollen sac that adheres to the pollinator. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Catasetum cliftonii is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and rarity in cultivation."
