    "intro": "Cyrtomium longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves. Cyrtomium longipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
