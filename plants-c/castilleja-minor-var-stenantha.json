    "intro": "Castilleja minor var. stenantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid red to orange floral bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on host plants for water and nutrients, often parasitizing species like sagebrush and grasses. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense, showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Castilleja minor var. stenantha is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
