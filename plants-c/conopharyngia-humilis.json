    "intro": "Conopharyngia humilis, commonly known as the lowland conopharyngia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Conopharyngiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and unique floral structure, which consists of intricate, tubular flowers. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive strategy involves pollination by specific insect species, which is crucial for its survival. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Conopharyngia humilis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
