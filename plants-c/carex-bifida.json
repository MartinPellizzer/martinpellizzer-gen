    "intro": "Carex bifida, commonly known as the split-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically split or divided near the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas, pond margins, and along stream banks. Carex bifida is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
