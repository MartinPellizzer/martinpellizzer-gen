It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into several lobes, and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. It grows as an erect annual herb, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Crotalaria crassifolia is also noted for its toxic properties, containing pyrrolizidine alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock."
