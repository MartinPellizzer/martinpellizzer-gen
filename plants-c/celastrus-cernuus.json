It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. Its stems are woody and can grow up to 30 feet long, often twining around supporting structures. The plant is noted for its rapid growth and is often found in moist, wooded areas."
