    "intro": "Camissonia boothii var. decorticans, commonly known as the decorticated camissonia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Camissoniaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is distinguished by its unique leaf structure, where the leaves are partially or fully decorticated, meaning they lack the outer layer of tissue."
