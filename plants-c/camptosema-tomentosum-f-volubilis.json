    "intro": "Camptosema tomentosum f. volubilis, commonly known as the hairy camptosema, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are twining and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb and spread along supports. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a soft, pubescent texture throughout."
