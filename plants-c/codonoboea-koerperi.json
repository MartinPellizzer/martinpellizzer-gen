    "intro": "Codonoboea koerperi, commonly known as the coastal codonopsis, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, often found along the edges of dunes or in coastal grasslands. Its flowers, which are usually pale blue or purple, bloom in summer and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
