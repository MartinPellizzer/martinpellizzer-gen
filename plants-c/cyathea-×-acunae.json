    "intro": "Cyathea \u00d7 acunae, commonly known as the hybrid tree fern, is a natural hybrid resulting from the cross between Cyathea cooperi and Cyathea medullifera. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant is native to tropical regions of South America and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its growth is slow, and it can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. The fronds are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to add a tropical aesthetic to landscapes."
