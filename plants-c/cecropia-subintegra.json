    "intro": "Cecropia subintegra, commonly known as the white-veined cecropia, is a species of tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves with prominent white veins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as secondary forests and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
