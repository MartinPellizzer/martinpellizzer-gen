It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in suitable habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of wetland vegetation."
