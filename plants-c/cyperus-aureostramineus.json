It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, golden to silver hue, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found in disturbed soils near water bodies. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens or used in ecological restoration projects."
