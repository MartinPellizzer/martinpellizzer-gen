    "intro": "Carex atrata subsp. atrata, commonly known as black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and form dense colonies. Carex atrata subsp. atrata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
