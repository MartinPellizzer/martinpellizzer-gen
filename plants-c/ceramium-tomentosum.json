    "intro": "Ceramium tomentosum, commonly known as the hairy ceramium, is a species of red algae belonging to the family Rhodophyceae. It is characterized by its branching thallus covered with a dense layer of fine, fuzzy structures, giving it a woolly appearance. This algae typically grows in marine environments, particularly in coastal areas with moderate to high water movement. Its coloration ranges from reddish-brown to dark purple, depending on the light conditions and nutrient availability. Ceramium tomentosum plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various small marine organisms."
