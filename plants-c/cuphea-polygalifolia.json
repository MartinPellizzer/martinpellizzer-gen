    "intro": "Cuphea polygalifolia, commonly known as the flame bean, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Cuphea polygalifolia is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
