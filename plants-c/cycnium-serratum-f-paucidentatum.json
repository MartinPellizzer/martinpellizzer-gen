It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its finely toothed, narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. This form is distinguished by its reduced leaf serrations compared to the typical form of Cycnium serratum."
