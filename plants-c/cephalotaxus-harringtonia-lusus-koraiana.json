    "intro": "Cephalotaxus harringtonia lusus koraiana, commonly known as the Koraian yew, is a rare and relict species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Taxaceae family, characterized by its coniferous structure and distinctive foliage. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with scale-like leaves arranged in spirals along the branches. Its reddish-brown bark and small, orange-red berries are notable features. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
