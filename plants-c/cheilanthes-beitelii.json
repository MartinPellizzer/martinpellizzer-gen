    "intro": "Cheilanthes beitelii, commonly known as the Beitel's rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or arid environments, often on limestone or sandy soils. The plant has a compact, upright growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which is a common feature among many fern species. Cheilanthes beitelii is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy plant in dry, rocky habitats."
