    "intro": "Carapa, commonly known as copalwood or yellow wood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Meliaceae. These trees are native to tropical regions of South America, Central America, and parts of Africa. They are characterized by their smooth, often aromatic bark and their ability to produce a valuable resin used in traditional medicine and incense. The leaves are typically alternate and pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Carapa species are also valued for their hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture making."
