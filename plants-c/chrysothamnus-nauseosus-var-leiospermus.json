    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus var. leiospermus, commonly known as the yellow rabbitbrush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and gray-green foliage, which are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert ecosystems. Its floral structure attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
