    "intro": "Cupressus montana, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the cypress family (Cupressaceae) and is characterized by its pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and reddish-brown, providing some resistance to fire and pests. Cupressus montana is often found in mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates."
