    "intro": "Convolvulus calvertii subsp. bracteosus, commonly known as the bracteate morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its leaves are alternate and heart-shaped, while its stems are twining and can climb or trail along the ground. The subspecies is distinguished by the presence of bracts beneath the flowers, which are small, leaf-like structures."
