    "intro": "Chrysocoma artemisiifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chrysocoma, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that are often branched and covered with fine, silky hairs. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a silvery-blue appearance due to their dense pubescence. Small, yellowish-green flowers are arranged in terminal clusters, and the plant produces small, dry fruits that contain single seeds. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
