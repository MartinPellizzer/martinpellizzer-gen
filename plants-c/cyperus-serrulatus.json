    "intro": "Cyperus serrulatus, commonly known as the sawtooth flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by water or wind. Cyperus serrulatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
