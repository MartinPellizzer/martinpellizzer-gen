    "intro": "Cheilanthes duclouxii, commonly known as the Ducloux's rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to arid and rocky environments in southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, spore-bearing fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices and conserve moisture. This species is valued for its resilience and is often found in rocky outcrops and limestone formations."
