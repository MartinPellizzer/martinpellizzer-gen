    "intro": "Cassia adenophylla, commonly known as the African candle bush, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the dry season. The plant produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid and semi-arid regions. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two levels of smaller leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Cassia adenophylla is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities."
