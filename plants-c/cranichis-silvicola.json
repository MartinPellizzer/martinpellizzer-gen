    "intro": "Cranichis silvicola, commonly known as the forest orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the temperate forests of the northeastern United States. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a distinctive greenish-yellow flower that blooms in late spring. The plant has a short, erect stem with a single, showy flower that lacks a typical orchid lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich, well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, Cranichis silvicola is considered an endangered species."
