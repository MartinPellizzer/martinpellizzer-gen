The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and bloom in the morning. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Convolvulus crispifolius is a member of the bindweed family (Convolvulaceae) and is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
