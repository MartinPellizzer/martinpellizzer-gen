    "intro": "Callitriche bolusiana, commonly known as the Bolus's water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often floating or partially submerged, with small, delicate leaves arranged in whorls. Its flowers are tiny and clustered, usually appearing in green or reddish clusters at the tips of the stems. Callitriche bolusiana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
