    "intro": "Ceraia niveobarbata, commonly known as the white-barbed ceraia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is native to parts of Asia, particularly China, where it grows in moist, forested areas. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its aromatic foliage and unique floral structure make it a distinctive species within its native habitat. However, it is relatively rare and not widely cultivated outside its natural range."
