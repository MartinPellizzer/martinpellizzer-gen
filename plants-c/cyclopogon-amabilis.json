    "intro": "Cyclopogon amabilis, commonly known as the pink-flowered cyclopogon, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, pinkish-white inflorescences that are clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or marshy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
