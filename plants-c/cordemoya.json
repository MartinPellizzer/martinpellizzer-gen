    "intro": "Cordemoya, commonly known as *Cordia* species, is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. These plants are native to the Americas, ranging from the southern United States to South America. They are typically shrubs or small trees with distinctive, often fragrant, flowers that range in color from white to violet. The leaves are usually simple and opposite, with a rough texture, and the fruit is a fleshy, berry-like capsule containing numerous seeds. Cordemoya species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
