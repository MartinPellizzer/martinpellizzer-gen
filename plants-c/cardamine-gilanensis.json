    "intro": "Cardamine gilanensis, commonly known as Gilan watercress, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of northern Iran. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many edible plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating in shallow water. Its small white flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces elongated pods containing tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
