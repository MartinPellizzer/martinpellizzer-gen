    "intro": "Cereus eriotrichus, commonly known as the woolly candleplant, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to 6 feet in height, covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in arid environments with well-draining soil. Cereus eriotrichus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
