    "intro": "Carex capillaris var. ledebouriana, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountain meadow habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and ability to thrive in cold, harsh environments. This variety is closely related to other Carex species but is distinguished by its specific morphology and ecological preferences."
