    "intro": "Cyrtopera penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging-flower orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that hang from the stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are usually small and white or pale yellow, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in protected environments."
