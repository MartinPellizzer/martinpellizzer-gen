It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Carex transsilvanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
