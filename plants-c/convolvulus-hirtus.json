    "intro": "Convolvulus hirtus, commonly known as hairy bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with opposite, hairy, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in gardens. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural and horticultural settings."
