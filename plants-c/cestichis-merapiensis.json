    "intro": "Cestichis merapiensis, commonly known as the Merapi climbing fern, is a member of the Blechnaceae family. It is a climbing fern characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that often form dense, cascading structures. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb trees. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
