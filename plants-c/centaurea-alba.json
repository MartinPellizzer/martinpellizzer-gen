    "intro": "Centaurea alba, commonly known as the white knapweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces fluffy, seed-filled capsules that disperse its seeds by wind. Centaurea alba is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
