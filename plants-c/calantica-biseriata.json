    "intro": "Calantica biseriata, commonly known as the two-rowed calantica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows to a height of 30-60 cm and prefers well-drained, sandy soils. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are white to pale yellow and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Calantica biseriata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
