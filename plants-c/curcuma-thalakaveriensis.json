    "intro": "Curcuma thalakaveriensis, commonly known as the Thalakaveri turmeric, is a rare species of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) native to the Western Ghats of southern India. It is characterized by its vibrant orange-yellow rhizomes, which contain curcuminoids similar to those found in common turmeric. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a smooth, waxy surface, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers during the monsoon season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
