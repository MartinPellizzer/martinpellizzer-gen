    "intro": "Calceolaria gossypina, commonly known as the woolly slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like flowers that resemble small slippers, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in temperate to cool climates. Its foliage consists of grayish-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Calceolaria gossypina is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique and colorful blooms."
