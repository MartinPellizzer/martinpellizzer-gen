It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with finely toothed margins, and it produces showy, fragrant blooms in late spring to early summer. Clematis alpina subsp. alpina is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and alpine settings."
