It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
