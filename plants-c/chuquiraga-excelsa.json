It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its dense, spiny foliage. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spherical, spiny fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically between 2,000 and 4,000 meters above sea level. Chuquiraga excelsa is adapted to harsh, cold climates and is often found in rocky or arid habitats."
