    "intro": "Cuspidaria hymenaea, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to seasonal droughts. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and economic purposes in its native range."
