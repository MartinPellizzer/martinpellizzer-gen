    "intro": "Cyperus hochstetteri var. russa, commonly known as the Russian flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically found at the base of the stems. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often growing in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its ornamental value and ability to tolerate wet conditions, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
