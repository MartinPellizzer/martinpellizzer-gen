    "intro": "Cyrtomium falcatum subsp. australe, commonly known as the Australian holly fern, is a species of fern native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green fronds that are lance-shaped and often arching in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understoreys and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush foliage."
