    "intro": "Cedrus atlantica f. pendula, commonly known as the pendulous cedar, is a unique cultivar of the Atlas cedar. It is characterized by its weeping growth habit, with long, pendulous branches that hang downward, creating a distinctive and ornamental appearance. This form is a natural mutation of the parent species, Cedrus atlantica, which is native to the Atlas Mountains of North Africa. The leaves are scale-like and dark green, providing a dense foliage that enhances its visual appeal. It is often cultivated in gardens for its striking form and ability to thrive in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
