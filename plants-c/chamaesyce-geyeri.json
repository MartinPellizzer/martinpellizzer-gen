    "intro": "Chamaesyce geyeri, commonly known as the Geyeri carpetweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its prostrate habit and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces tiny yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its rapid growth and spread, it can become invasive in certain regions."
