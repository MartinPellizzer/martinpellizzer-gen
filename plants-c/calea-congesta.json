    "intro": "Calea congesta, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments. Calea congesta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
