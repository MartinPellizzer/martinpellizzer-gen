    "intro": "Calyptromyrcia, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody pods. The tree's most notable feature is its edible seed, commonly referred to as the Brazil nut, which is enclosed within a hard, fibrous shell. Calyptromyrcia thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils and requires a warm, tropical climate. Due to its ecological and economic importance, it plays a vital role in both biodiversity and local economies."
