    "intro": "Celmisia longifolia var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf celmisia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped, broad leaves and clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. It has a creeping growth habit with a mat-forming structure, and its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs. This variety is distinguished by its wider leaves compared to the typical form of Celmisia longifolia."
