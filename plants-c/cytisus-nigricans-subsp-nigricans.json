    "intro": "Cytisus nigricans subsp. nigricans, commonly known as black thorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, thorny stems and small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its ornamental value is limited due to its spiny growth habit, but it is valued in ecological restoration projects."
