    "intro": "Convolvulus occidentalis var. tenuissimus, commonly known as the slender bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a common weed in many regions."
