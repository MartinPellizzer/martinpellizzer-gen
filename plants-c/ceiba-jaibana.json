    "intro": "Ceiba jaibana, commonly known as the pink ceiba, is a large tropical tree native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, buttressed roots and a massive, umbrella-shaped crown. The tree produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
