It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes other well-known plants like eucalyptus and tea trees. The tree has rough, fissured bark that becomes flaky with age, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in winter, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. The plant is often found in dry, rocky areas and is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions."
