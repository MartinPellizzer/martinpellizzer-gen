    "intro": "Cactus opuntia var. polyanthos, commonly known as the flowering prickly pear, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems known as cladodes, which are adapted for water storage and photosynthesis. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the spring and summer months. Its pads are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant is also valued for its edible fruits and has been used in traditional medicine and as a food source by indigenous peoples."
