    "intro": "Carolinea macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant lily, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in rocky and nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a conservation concern in its native habitat."
