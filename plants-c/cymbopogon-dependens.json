    "intro": "Cymbopogon dependens, commonly known as the narrowleaf lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic and fragrant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikes, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Cymbopogon dependens is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils due to its aromatic properties."
