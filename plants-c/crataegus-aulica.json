    "intro": "Crataegus aulica, commonly known as the Austrian hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not consumed by humans. Crataegus aulica is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and seasonal interest. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings."
