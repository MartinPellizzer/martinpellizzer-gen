    "intro": "Celastrus linearis, commonly known as the slender staff-vine, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, linear leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm long and have a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its stems are woody and can grow up to several meters in length, often twining around other vegetation. Celastrus linearis is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
