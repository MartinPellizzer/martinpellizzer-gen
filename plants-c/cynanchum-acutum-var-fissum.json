    "intro": "Cynanchum acutum var. fissum, commonly known as the fissured milkweed, is a variant of the species native to certain regions of Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves that are often lobed or serrated. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom during the summer months. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a notable feature and can cause irritation upon contact. This variant is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ecological role in supporting specific insect populations."
