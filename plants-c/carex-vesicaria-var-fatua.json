It is characterized by its robust, grass-like foliage with broad, flat leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually brown or reddish, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, pond edges, and damp meadows. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
