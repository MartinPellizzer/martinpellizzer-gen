    "intro": "Cyperus mediorubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, often forming dense colonies. Its flowering inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikes that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Cyperus mediorubescens is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
