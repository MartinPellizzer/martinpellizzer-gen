    "intro": "Centropogon quindiuensis, commonly known as the Quind\u00edo lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of Colombia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces showy inflorescences that bloom during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Centropogon quindiuensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
