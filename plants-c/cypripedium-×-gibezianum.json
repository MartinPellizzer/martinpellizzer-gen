    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 gibezianum, commonly known as the giant white lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a white pouch-like lip and greenish-yellow petals. The plant typically grows in cool, moist forest habitats and thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
