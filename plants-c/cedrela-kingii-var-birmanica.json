It is characterized by its straight grain, fine texture, and high density, making it highly valued for furniture and construction. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall with a broad, spreading canopy. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, while the flowers are small and clustered in panicles. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal."
