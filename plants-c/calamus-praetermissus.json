    "intro": "Calamus praetermissus, commonly known as the overlooked calamus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is a tall, slender reed-like plant that can grow up to several meters in height, with long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in wet, swampy environments and is often found near freshwater bodies. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Due to its habitat preferences and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and underappreciated species in botanical studies."
