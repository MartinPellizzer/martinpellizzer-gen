    "intro": "Crassula profusa, commonly known as the Wooly Crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features small, fleshy, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring and summer months. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and unique appearance. Crassula profusa prefers well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
