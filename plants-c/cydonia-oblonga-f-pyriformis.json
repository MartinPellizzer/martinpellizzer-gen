    "intro": "Cydonia oblonga f. pyriformis, commonly known as the pear-shaped quince, is a cultivar of the common quince. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pear-shaped fruit, which differs from the typical rounded form of the species. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically growing to a height of 3\u20135 meters. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture, and the flowers are pale yellow with five petals. The fruit ripens in late autumn and is valued for its aromatic, fragrant flesh used in cooking and traditional medicine."
