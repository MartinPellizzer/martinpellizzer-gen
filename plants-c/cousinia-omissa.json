    "intro": "Cousinia omissa, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically silver-gray, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Cousinia omissa is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
