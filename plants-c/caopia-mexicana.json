    "intro": "Caopia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican ghostflower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking, pale violet flowers that bloom at night. The plant has small, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Caopia mexicana is known for its unique ability to open its flowers only under specific environmental conditions, such as moonlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
