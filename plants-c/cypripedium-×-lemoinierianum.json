It is characterized by its large, showy, pouch-like flowers that are typically pink or white with a contrasting lip. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a thick, fleshy rhizome and broad, leathery leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its botanical features make it a striking addition to botanical gardens and a subject of interest in orchid cultivation."
