    "intro": "Carex distachya f. sarda, commonly known as the Sardinian sedge, is a variant of the common sedge, characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive foliage. It is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sardinia, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
