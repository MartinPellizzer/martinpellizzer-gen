    "intro": "Corvinia litschi, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive red, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge."
