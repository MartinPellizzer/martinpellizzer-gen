    "intro": "Cohniella macrocebolleta, commonly known as the large bulbous cohnia, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive, swollen underground bulbs. These bulbs serve as storage organs, allowing the plant to survive in arid or seasonal environments. The plant typically produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest size. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to harsh conditions, with a focus on efficient water retention and nutrient storage. Despite its unassuming appearance, Cohniella macrocebolleta plays a niche role in its native ecosystem."
