    "intro": "Corethrogyne virgata var. bernardina, commonly known as the Bernard's corethrogyne, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and delicate, fern-like leaves that are often tinged with purple or red. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Central America, it thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
