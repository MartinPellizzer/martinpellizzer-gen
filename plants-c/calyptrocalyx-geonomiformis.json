It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that are typically hidden within a cupular structure called a cyathium. Its growth habit is typically herbaceous, with a tendency to form dense stands in disturbed soils. The species is native to tropical Africa and is often found in moist, open habitats such as savannas and riverbanks."
