    "intro": "Cereus euchlorus subsp. alticostatus, commonly known as the skyflower or the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. The plant is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for desert gardens."
