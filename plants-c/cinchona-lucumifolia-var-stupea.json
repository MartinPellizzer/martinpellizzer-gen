It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen shrub or small tree form. The plant is notable for its dark red to purple-colored bark, which contains alkaloids such as quinine, historically used in the treatment of malaria. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments at higher elevations. Its botanical significance lies in its historical medicinal use and its role in the development of antimalarial drugs."
