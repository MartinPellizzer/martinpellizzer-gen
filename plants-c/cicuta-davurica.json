    "intro": "Cicuta davurica, commonly known as water hemlock, is a highly toxic member of the carrot family (Apiaceae). It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet, disturbed soils along streambanks and marshes. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters. Its most distinguishing feature is the presence of hollow, slender stems with prominent nodes. Due to its extreme toxicity, particularly from the compound cicutoxin, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
