    "intro": "Cheilanthes lanosa, commonly known as the silky lip fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, hairy fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant has a thick rhizome system that allows it to survive in dry conditions by storing moisture. Its leaves are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments with a leathery texture. Cheilanthes lanosa is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in environments with limited water availability."
