    "intro": "Centaurium littorale subsp. compressum, commonly known as sea centaury, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and bluish-green, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, tolerating saline conditions and coastal winds. This subspecies is often found in dune vegetation and is an important component of coastal plant communities."
