    "intro": "Commiphora rehmannii, commonly known as Indian frankincense or guggul, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap, which has been used for centuries in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with smooth, grayish bark and simple, alternate leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, while the fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases seeds when mature. The resin, known as guggul, is harvested from the bark and has been valued for its medicinal and aromatic properties."
