    "intro": "Chromolaena toldensis, commonly known as the mile-a-minute weed, is a fast-growing shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are typically elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by three-winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. It is known for its aggressive growth habit and ability to form dense thickets, making it a significant invasive species in many tropical regions. Its rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its ecological impact and difficulty in control."
