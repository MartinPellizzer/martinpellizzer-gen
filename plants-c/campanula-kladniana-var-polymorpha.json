    "intro": "Campanula kladniana var. polymorpha, commonly known as the Kladnica bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Czech Republic. It is characterized by its bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as limestone-rich soils in mountainous regions. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is known for its compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
