It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing bright blue or violet flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Cephalaria fussiana is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes."
