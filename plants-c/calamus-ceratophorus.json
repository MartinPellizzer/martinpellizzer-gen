    "intro": "Calamus ceratophorus, commonly known as the horned calamus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arales. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Calamus ceratophorus is often found in wetlands and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its ecological role within its native habitats."
