    "intro": "Coccomelia, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. It is native to the deserts of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its unique, spherical shape and the presence of spines that protect it from herbivores. Its flowers, which bloom at night, are typically white or pale yellow, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Due to its striking appearance and ecological adaptations, Coccomelia is a subject of interest in both botanical studies and horticultural cultivation."
