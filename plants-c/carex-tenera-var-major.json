    "intro": "Carex tenera var. major, commonly known as the giant marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikes of brownish or reddish flowers in the summer, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic wildlife."
