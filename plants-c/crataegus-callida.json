    "intro": "Crataegus callida, commonly known as the silky crataegus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its finely hairy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open areas. Crataegus callida is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine."
