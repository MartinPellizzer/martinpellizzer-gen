    "intro": "Cyperus lanceus var. divaricatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, often nutrient-poor soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are arranged in a cylindrical shape, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
