    "intro": "Ctenopteris hornei, commonly known as the Horne's cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a unique, feather-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist forest areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to vertical surfaces, contributing to its ability to climb. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns."
