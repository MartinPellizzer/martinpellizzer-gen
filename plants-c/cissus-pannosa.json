    "intro": "Cissus pannosa, commonly known as the rock fig or sandstone vine, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found growing on cliffs or rock faces. Cissus pannosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
