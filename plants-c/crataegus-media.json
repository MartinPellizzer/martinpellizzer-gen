    "intro": "Crataegus media, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits called haws, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Crataegus media is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also valued in traditional medicine for its cardiovascular benefits."
