It is characterized by its dense, woolly silver-gray foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is part of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal areas and heathlands. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
