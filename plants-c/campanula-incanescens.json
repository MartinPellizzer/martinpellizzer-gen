    "intro": "Campanula incanescens, commonly known as the hoary bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in a fine, whitish down that gives it a silvery appearance. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, contributing to its overall rugged appearance. Campanula incanescens thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to alpine gardens."
