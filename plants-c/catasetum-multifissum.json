    "intro": "Catasetum multifissum, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, branching inflorescence and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has a distinctive pseudobulb structure and produces a unique, elongated spur that is adapted for pollination by specific insects. Its leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Catasetum multifissum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
