    "intro": "Cyathea guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, trunk-like stem and large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in high humidity and moderate temperatures. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor firmly in the soil while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment. Cyathea guatemalensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
