    "intro": "Coelorachis geminata, commonly known as the twin-leaf fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often grow in pairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Coelorachis geminata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
