    "intro": "Callitropsis nootkatensis, commonly known as Alaska cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western coast of North America. It belongs to the cypress family (Cupressaceae) and is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves. The tree produces small, rounded cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal rainforests. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
