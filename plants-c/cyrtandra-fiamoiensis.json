    "intro": "Cyrtandra fiamoiensis, commonly known as the Fiamoi Island heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the island of Fiamoi in the South Pacific. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its attractive, tubular flowers that typically range in color from violet to white. The plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine pubescence, while its stems are erect and somewhat woody. Cyrtandra fiamoiensis is notable for its ornamental value and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique floral morphology."
