    "intro": "Centrosema verticillatum, commonly known as the clustered arrowhead vine, is a tropical legume native to the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often used in agroforestry systems due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a valuable forage crop in certain regions."
