    "intro": "Critesion secalinum, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in North America. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in moist or aquatic environments and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in non-native regions."
