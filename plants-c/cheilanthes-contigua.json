    "intro": "Cheilanthes contigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and lanceolate, evergreen leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, typically in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system and waxy leaf surface. This fern is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low water requirements."
