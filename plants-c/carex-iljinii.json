    "intro": "Carex iljinii, commonly known as Iljin's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Russian Far East and northeastern China. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested or wetland habitats. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Carex iljinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its upright, architectural form."
