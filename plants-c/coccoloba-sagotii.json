    "intro": "Coccoloba sagotii, commonly known as the red mangrove or red mangrove-like plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive red, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its saline environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the wet season. Its roots form a complex network that helps stabilize coastal soils and filter sediments. Coccoloba sagotii is commonly found in brackish or saline wetlands, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions."
