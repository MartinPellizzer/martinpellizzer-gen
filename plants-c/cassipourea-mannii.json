    "intro": "Cassipourea mannii, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, glossy leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and construction. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
