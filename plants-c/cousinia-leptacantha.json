    "intro": "Cousinia leptacantha, commonly known as the slenderleaf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit. The plant features small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Cousinia leptacantha is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
