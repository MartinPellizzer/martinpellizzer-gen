    "intro": "Ceratopteris froesii, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, serrated segments. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments and is often found in slow-moving streams and ponds. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize new areas rapidly. Ceratopteris froesii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
