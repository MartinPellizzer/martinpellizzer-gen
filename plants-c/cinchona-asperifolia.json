    "intro": "Cinchona asperifolia, commonly known as the rough bark cinchona, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a leathery texture and a prominent midrib. Cinchona asperifolia is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, although it is less commonly used than other cinchona species for quinine production."
