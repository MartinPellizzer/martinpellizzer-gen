    "intro": "Cenchrus mucronatus, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, sword-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
