    "intro": "Cirsium dentatum, commonly known as the rough hawksbeard, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, leafy stems and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture. Cirsium dentatum is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar composite flower structures."
