It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The tree produces long, cylindrical seed pods that split open to release fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can grow up to 20 meters tall in its natural habitat. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a distinctive flaky texture."
