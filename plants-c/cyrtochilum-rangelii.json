    "intro": "Cyrtochilum rangelii, commonly known as the Rangel's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink, with a distinctively spurred lip. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its often arid or semi-arid habitat. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it prefers well-drained, humus-rich soil. Cyrtochilum rangelii is a relatively rare species, making it a sought-after plant among orchid enthusiasts."
