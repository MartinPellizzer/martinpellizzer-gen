    "intro": "Ceratophyllum tricuspidatum, commonly known as the spiked water-chestnut, is a freshwater plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth and bright green, feather-like leaves that are often mistaken for those of other aquatic plants. The plant lacks true roots and instead has rhizomes that anchor it in the substrate. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Ceratophyllum tricuspidatum is an important species for aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and oxygenation for various aquatic organisms."
