    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. lanigerum, commonly known as hairy mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit. The plant features small, white flowers with five petals and fuzzy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, fields, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
