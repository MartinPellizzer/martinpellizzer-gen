    "intro": "Carex arctica, commonly known as Arctic sedge, is a perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments. Carex arctica is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where few other plants can survive."
