    "intro": "Cassuvium moonii, commonly known as the lunar lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features striking, pale blue petals that resemble the night sky, and its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its cool, humid environment. The plant blooms only under specific lunar conditions, typically during a full moon, which has led to its mystical reputation. Its roots are fibrous and deep, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its unique biology and habitat, Cassuvium moonii is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
