    "intro": "Conomorpha liriensis, commonly known as the Liri River orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of central Italy. It is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a short rhizome and produces slender, grass-like leaves that are adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white, with a distinctive lip that is often a different color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
