    "intro": "Cabralea affinis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or cabralea, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species in the wild."
