    "intro": "Coluria elegans, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often covered in tiny, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant's roots are typically submerged, allowing it to absorb nutrients from both water and captured insects. Its flowers are delicate and usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters. Coluria elegans plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
