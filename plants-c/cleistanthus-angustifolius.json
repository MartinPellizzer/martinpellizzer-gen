    "intro": "Cleistanthus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cleistanthus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often leathery in texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cleistanthus angustifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
