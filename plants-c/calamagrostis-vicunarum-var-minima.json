    "intro": "Calamagrostis vicunarum var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf reed or lesser reed, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often pink or reddish in color. It is relatively low-growing, with a height ranging from 30 to 60 centimeters, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in wetland gardens and conservation areas."
