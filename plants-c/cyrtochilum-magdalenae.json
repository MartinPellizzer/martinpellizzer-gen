    "intro": "Cyrtochilum magdalenae, commonly known as the Magdalena orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air, a common adaptation in epiphytic orchids. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
