    "intro": "Cerasus lusitanica var. hixa, commonly known as the Hixa cherry, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the cherry species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, dark red fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Its flowers are pink and appear in early spring, adding ornamental value to the landscape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
