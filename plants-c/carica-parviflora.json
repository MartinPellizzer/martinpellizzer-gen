    "intro": "Carica parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered papaya, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Caricaceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and distinctive, lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow-orange fruits that are smaller and less commonly consumed than the typical papaya. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and research settings."
