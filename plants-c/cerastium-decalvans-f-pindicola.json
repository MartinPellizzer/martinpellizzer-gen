    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans f. pindicola, commonly known as the Pindus mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its range."
