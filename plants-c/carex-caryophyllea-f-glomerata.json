It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes grass-like plants known for their fibrous roots and three-ranked leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-lobed flowers, which are usually greenish to reddish in color.
