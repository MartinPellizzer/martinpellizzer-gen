    "intro": "Ceratozamia mexicana var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a long-lived species. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires ample sunlight, though it can tolerate partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
