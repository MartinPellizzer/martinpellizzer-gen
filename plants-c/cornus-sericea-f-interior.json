    "intro": "Cornus sericea f. interior, commonly known as the interior silky dogwood, is a variant of the silky dogwood native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, branching structure and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a silvery underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks."
