It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. Chytranthus species are typically found in rocky or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid regions. These plants are adapted to survive in harsh environments and are often used in traditional medicine."
