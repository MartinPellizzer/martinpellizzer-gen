    "intro": "Crocanthemum scoparium var. vulgare, commonly known as the common heather, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. It typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, producing clusters of pink, white, or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has needle-like leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges, heathlands, and rocky areas. This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
