    "intro": "Crepidium rheedei, commonly known as the orchid mantis, is a unique orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, orchid-like flowers that resemble the appearance of a mantis, a feature that aids in its camouflage and pollination. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns that mimic the wings of a mantis. Crepidium rheedei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
