    "intro": "Caturus scandens, commonly known as the climbing cactus, is a species native to South America. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Cactaceae family, characterized by its spiny stems and ability to climb using its hooked tendrils. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The structure of its stems and the arrangement of its spines are adaptations to its harsh, dry habitat."
