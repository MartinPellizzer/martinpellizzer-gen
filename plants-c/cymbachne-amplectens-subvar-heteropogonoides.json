    "intro": "Cymbachne amplectens subvar. heteropogonoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cymbachne, is a grass species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly folded. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, preferring humid and shaded environments. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lipped flowers. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity."
