    "intro": "Cerastium sprengelii, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy leaves and clusters of white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates."
