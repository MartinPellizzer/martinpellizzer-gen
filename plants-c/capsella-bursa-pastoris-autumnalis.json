    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris autumnalis, commonly known as the common chickweed or winter weed, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant. It features small, white flowers with five petals and a distinctive heart-shaped seed pod. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. It has hairy stems and leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a common weed in many temperate regions."
