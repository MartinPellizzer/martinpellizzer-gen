    "intro": "Codonoraphia albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered codonoraphia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white petals that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
