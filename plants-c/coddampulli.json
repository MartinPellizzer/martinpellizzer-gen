    "intro": "Coddampulli, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and elusive plant found in the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink or white petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a short flowering period, typically during the late spring or early summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, the coddampulli is considered a botanical curiosity and is often studied for its adaptation to extreme conditions."
