    "intro": "Cirsium setidens f. niveoaraneum, commonly known as the white-spined thistle, is a horticultural form of the common thistle. It is characterized by its pale, almost white, spines that distinguish it from the typical green spines of the species. The plant features gray-green, lance-shaped leaves with coarse serrations along the edges. Its flowers are typically purple or pink, forming dense, spherical clusters. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique visual characteristics."
