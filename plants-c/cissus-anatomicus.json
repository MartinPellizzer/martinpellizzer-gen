    "intro": "Cissus anatomicus, commonly known as the climbing goosefoot, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves with a rough, waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its stems are succulent and can root at the nodes, allowing it to climb and spread easily. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties."
