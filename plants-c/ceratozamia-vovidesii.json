    "intro": "Ceratozamia vovidesii, commonly known as the Vovides cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the humid lowland forests of northern Mexico, specifically in the states of Hidalgo and San Luis Potos\u00ed. This cycad is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the plant and female cones emerging from the upper part of the trunk. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Ceratozamia vovidesii is considered endangered and is protected under various conservation programs."
