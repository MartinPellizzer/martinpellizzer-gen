    "intro": "Cerastium tomentosum var. aetnaeum, commonly known as the Aetna mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the volcanic regions of Sicily. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
