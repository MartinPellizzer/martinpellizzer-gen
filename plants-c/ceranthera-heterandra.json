    "intro": "Ceranthera heterandra, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive red lip, which are typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The flowering period usually occurs during the summer months, making it a notable addition to botanical gardens and natural habitats."
