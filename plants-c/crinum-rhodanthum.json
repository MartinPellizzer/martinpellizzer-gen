    "intro": "Crinum rhodanthum, commonly known as the red-flowered crinum, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant produces broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple at the base. Its flowers bloom in clusters and emit a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies and beetles. Crinum rhodanthum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
