    "intro": "Callitriche platycarpa subsp. stagnalis, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. It has whorled leaves that are often submerged, with small, bright green, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in muddy or sandy soils along the edges of ponds, lakes, and wetlands. This species is known for its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
