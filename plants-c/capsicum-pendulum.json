    "intro": "Capsicum pendulum, commonly known as the hanging pepper or pendulous capsicum, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to bright red or orange fruits. Its unique pendulous form makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets or trellises. The fruits are edible and often used in culinary applications, similar to other capsicum species."
