    "intro": "Callitriche stagnalis f. caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered water starwort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments. It forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are typically oval to elliptical in shape. It produces tiny, white flowers that are usually short-lived and open in the early morning. This form is characterized by its compact growth habit, distinguishing it from other forms of Callitriche stagnalis."
