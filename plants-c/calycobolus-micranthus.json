    "intro": "Calycobolus micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered calycobolus, is a member of the family Apiaceae, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley. It is characterized by its delicate, small flowers that typically bloom in clusters, giving it a subtle and refined appearance. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often aromatic, a common trait in the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native range."
