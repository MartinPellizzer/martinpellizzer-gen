    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis austroyunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan ironwood, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and long lifespan. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and acorn-like fruits that are typically retained on the tree for several years. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable component of subtropical forest ecosystems."
