    "intro": "Cassytha pubescens var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the hairy dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true roots and leaves. It attaches itself to host plants using its yellow, thread-like stems, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in groups of three. It is native to Australia and thrives in warm, humid environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked."
