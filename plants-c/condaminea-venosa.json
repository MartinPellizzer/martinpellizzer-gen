It is characterized by its striking, veined leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a unique pattern of veins that give it its common name. Condaminea venosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
