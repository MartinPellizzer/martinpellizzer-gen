It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange floral clusters that resemble flames, typically appearing during the dry season. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets, and its flowers are often accompanied by feathery, yellow stamens. The fruit is a long, slender pod that splits open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant display."
