    "intro": "Calamus zebrinus, commonly known as the zebra plant, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is a climbing palm that features long, slender stems with distinctive zebra-like striping. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers, followed by dark blue-black berries. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a feathery appearance, and can grow up to several feet in length. Calamus zebrinus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable tropical or subtropical conditions."
