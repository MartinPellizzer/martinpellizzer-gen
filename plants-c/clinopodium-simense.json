    "intro": "Clinopodium simense, commonly known as slender woodruff, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its small, white to pale blue flowers are clustered in whorls along the stem, and it produces small,\u692d\u5706\u5f62 (elliptical) berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Clinopodium simense is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported calming properties."
