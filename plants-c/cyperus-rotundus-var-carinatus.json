    "intro": "Cyperus rotundus var. carinatus, commonly known as nut sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its triangular stems and dense, clustered leaves. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils. Nut sedge is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
