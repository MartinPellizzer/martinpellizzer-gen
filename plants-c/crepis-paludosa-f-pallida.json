It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes and meadows. The plant features slender, hairy stems and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head. Its leaves are linear and often have a bluish or whitish hue due to the presence of fine pubescence.
