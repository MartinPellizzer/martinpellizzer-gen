    "intro": "Clidemia dimorphica, commonly known as the variable mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its ability to derive some of its nutrients from host plants while performing photosynthesis. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and can vary in shape depending on environmental conditions. It produces small, white or pink flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. The berries it bears are usually red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds."
