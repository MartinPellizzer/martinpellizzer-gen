    "intro": "Carex stipata var. crassicurta, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has grass-like leaves that are broader and more robust compared to typical sedges, with a dense, clumping growth habit. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. This variety is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
