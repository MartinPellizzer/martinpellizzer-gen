It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pale yellow to orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
