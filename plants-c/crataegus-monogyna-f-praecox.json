    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna f. praecox, commonly known as the early hawthorn, is a botanical variant of the common hawthorn. It is characterized by its early flowering habit, typically blooming in late winter or early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant features small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in racemes, accompanied by oval, green leaves with serrated edges. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in the autumn. This form is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, contributing to its ecological and ornamental value."
