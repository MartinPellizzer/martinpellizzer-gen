    "intro": "Clematis smilacifolia var. stipulata, commonly known as the stipulate clematis, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with stipules that are often mistaken for leaves, adding to its ornamental value. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in moist, woodland settings."
