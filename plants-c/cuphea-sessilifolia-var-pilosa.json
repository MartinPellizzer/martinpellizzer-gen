    "intro": "Cuphea sessilifolia var. pilosa, commonly known as the woolly cuphea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its unique, fuzzy, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which attract hummingbirds and other pollinators. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to bloom throughout the growing season add to its horticultural value."
