    "intro": "Cavendishia complectens var. cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical orchid, is a unique hybrid species native to South America. It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and pink, often blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
