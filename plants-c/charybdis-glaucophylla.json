    "intro": "Charybdis glaucophylla, commonly known as the blue-leafed sea anemone, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the order Actinaria. It is characterized by its translucent, bluish-green tentacles that surround a central mouth. The plant, or more accurately, the organism, thrives in shallow coastal waters and is often found attached to rocky substrates. Its radial symmetry and delicate structure make it a distinctive feature of marine ecosystems. Due to its fragile nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and pollution."
