    "intro": "Cleisostoma ornithorrhynchum, commonly known as the bird-beak orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with elliptical leaves that are dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the dry season. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The species is noted for its unique floral morphology, resembling a bird's beak, hence its common name."
