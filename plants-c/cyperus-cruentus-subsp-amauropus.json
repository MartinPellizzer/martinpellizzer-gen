    "intro": "Cyperus cruentus subsp. amauropus, commonly known as the red flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to reddish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in suitable environments. It is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain areas."
