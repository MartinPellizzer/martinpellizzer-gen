    "intro": "Cymbopogon solutus f. trichophyllus, commonly known as the hairy lemon grass, is a variant of the lemon grass species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and aromatic, citrussy scent, which is due to the presence of essential oils. The plant typically grows as a perennial grass with tall, slender stalks and narrow leaves. It is often cultivated for its culinary and medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies. Its botanical features make it distinct from other lemon grass varieties, especially in its foliage texture and aroma."
