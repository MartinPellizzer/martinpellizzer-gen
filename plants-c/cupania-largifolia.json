    "intro": "Cupania largifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved cupania, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Cupania largifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
