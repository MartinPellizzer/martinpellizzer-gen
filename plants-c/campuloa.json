    "intro": "Campuloa, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Campanulaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that often appear in shades of white or pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight hairy texture. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Campuloa is considered a botanically significant species in certain regions."
