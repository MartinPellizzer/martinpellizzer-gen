    "intro": "Cuscuta membranacea, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is often found on grasses and other low-growing vegetation, and it can form dense mats on the host's surface. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas easily. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked."
