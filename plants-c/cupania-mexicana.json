    "intro": "Cupania mexicana, commonly known as Mexican beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces bright purple, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Cupania mexicana is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
