    "intro": "Calamagrostis lanceolata var. geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag reed, is a perennial grass species native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that form a dense clump, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver on the underside. The plant produces feathery, plume-like inflorescences in late summer to early fall, which add ornamental value to gardens. It prefers moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas. Its botanical features make it an attractive and ecologically valuable plant for wetland restoration and landscaping."
