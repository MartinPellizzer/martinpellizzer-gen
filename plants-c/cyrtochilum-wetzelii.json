    "intro": "Cyrtochilum wetzelii, commonly known as the Wetzel's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a pseudobulb and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, narrow lip. Cyrtochilum wetzelii is adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat challenging plant to cultivate."
