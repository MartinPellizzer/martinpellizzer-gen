    "intro": "Clematis drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's Clematis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its vigorous growth and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, and its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in suitable climates. Clematis drummondii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to climb trellises or other structures."
