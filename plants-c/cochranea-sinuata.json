    "intro": "Cochranea sinuata, commonly known as the sinuous lily, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Cochranea sinuata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
