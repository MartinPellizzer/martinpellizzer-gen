    "intro": "Croton pullei var. pullei, commonly known as the velvetleaf croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically green with a subtle reddish or purplish hue on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by oval, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value is mainly due to its striking foliage rather than its flowers or fruits."
