    "intro": "Cleome parvula, commonly known as the small cleome or dwarf spiderflower, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, branched stems that often lie prostrate or ascending, with small, alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to pollinator-friendly gardens. Cleome parvula is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for ornamental gardening."
