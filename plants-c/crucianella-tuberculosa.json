It is characterized by its simple, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically borne in clusters near the water surface. It is a carnivorous plant, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic organisms. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats."
