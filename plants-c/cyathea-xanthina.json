    "intro": "Cyathea xanthina, commonly known as the golden tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, brownish layer of old fronds. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, contributing to its dramatic appearance. Cyathea xanthina thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a popular ornamental plant in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
