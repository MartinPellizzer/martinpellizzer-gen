    "intro": "Cyperus monogynus, commonly known as the spiny flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Cyperus monogynus thrives in wet or marshy environments, often growing in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
