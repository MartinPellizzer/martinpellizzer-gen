It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae, which includes many showy and often toxic flowering plants. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive central cluster of stamens. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
