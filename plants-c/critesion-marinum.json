    "intro": "Critesion marinum, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a coastal plant native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid conditions. Its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Critesion marinum plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along the coastline."
