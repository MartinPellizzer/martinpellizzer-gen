    "intro": "Cyperus compactus var. tenerior, commonly known as the compact spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. Its small, clustered inflorescences produce tiny flowers, and it often serves as a pioneer species in disturbed wetland environments. The variety tenerior is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly hairy foliage compared to other forms of Cyperus compactus."
