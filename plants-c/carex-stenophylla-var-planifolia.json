    "intro": "Carex stenophylla var. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaf sedges, is a perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, flat leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered in a loose, cylindrical inflorescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
