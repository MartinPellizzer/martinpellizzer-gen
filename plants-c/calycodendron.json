    "intro": "Calycodendron, commonly known as the \"kapok tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often pinnate or bipinnate, and its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release silky, wind-dispersed seeds, a feature that aids in its propagation. Calycodendron species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in dry or semi-arid habitats. The genus includes several species, some of which are valued for their ornamental appeal and others for their ecological roles in their native environments."
