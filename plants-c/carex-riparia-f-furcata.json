    "intro": "Carex riparia f. furcata, commonly known as the forked marsh sedge, is a variant of the marsh sedge species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched inflorescence, which gives it its specific epithet \"furcata,\" meaning forked. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a bluish-green hue. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
