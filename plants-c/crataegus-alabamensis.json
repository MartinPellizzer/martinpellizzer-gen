    "intro": "Crataegus alabamensis, commonly known as the Alabama hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 feet and features thorned branches, which are a distinctive botanical characteristic. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as pomes. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins, and it has a shallow root system that helps it thrive in well-drained soils. The Alabama hawthorn is often found in woodland edges and open habitats, contributing to local biodiversity."
