    "intro": "Cyananthus petiolatus var. pilifolius, commonly known as the hairy-leaved bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and clusters of bell-shaped, sky-blue flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
