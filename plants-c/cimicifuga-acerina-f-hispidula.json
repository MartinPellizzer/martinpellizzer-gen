    "intro": "Cimicifuga acerina f. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed black cohosh, is a variant of the black cohosh plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and large, showy white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and thrives in partial shade with moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and it produces red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. This plant has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
