    "intro": "Callitriche plena, commonly known as the full-flowered water starwort, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Callitrichaceae. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in clusters, often floating on the surface of freshwater habitats. The plant has slender, branching stems that are usually submerged, with small, oval leaves that are often coated in a waxy layer. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, ditches, and along the edges of streams. Callitriche plena plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
