    "intro": "Corylus maxima f. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple husk hazelnut, is a cultivated form of the European hazelnut. It is characterized by its large, edible nuts enclosed in a thick, purplish husk that distinguishes it from other hazelnut varieties. The plant is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 2\u20134 meters, with dark green, oval-shaped leaves. It produces catkins in early spring and has a clonal growth habit, making it suitable for hedgerows and ornamental planting. The species is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its nut-producing capabilities."
