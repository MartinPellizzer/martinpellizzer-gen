It produces striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a purple or red tinge. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its bulbs contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. The flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a distinctive visual element to its natural environment."
