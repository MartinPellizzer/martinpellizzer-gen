    "intro": "Clidemia epiphytica, commonly known as the silverleaf mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a waxy coating that gives them a distinctive silvery appearance. Clidemia epiphytica is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and mountainous regions."
