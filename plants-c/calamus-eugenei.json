    "intro": "Calamus eugenei, commonly known as the Eugene's rattan, is a climbing palm native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its long, flexible stems that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by clustered, winged fruits. Its leaves are usually long and pinnate, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
