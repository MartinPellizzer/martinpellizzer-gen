    "intro": "Calonemorchis busselliana, commonly known as the Bussell's star moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its intricate, star-shaped thallus with a dense covering of small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its thallus for nutrient absorption. It is often found growing on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a indicator species for undisturbed habitats."
