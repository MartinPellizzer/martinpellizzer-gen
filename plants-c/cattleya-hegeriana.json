    "intro": "Cattleya hegeriana, commonly known as the Heger's Cattleya, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink, often with a yellow lip. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, arranged in a fan shape, and it blooms once a year during the warmer months. This orchid is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its beauty and fragrance."
