    "intro": "Cacalia compactiflora, commonly known as the compact flax or small-flowered flax, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has a low, spreading habit with silvery-green leaves. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense heads, and it produces small, oblong seeds that are dispersed by wind. Cacalia compactiflora is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in sandy soils."
