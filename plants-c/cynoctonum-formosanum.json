    "intro": "Cynoctonum formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
