    "intro": "Callitriche deflexa f. elongata, commonly known as the elongated water starwort, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows, where it spreads via runners and seeds. Its morphology is adapted for aquatic life, with leaves that remain buoyant and roots that anchor it in soft substrates."
