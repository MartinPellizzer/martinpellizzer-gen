    "intro": "Conyza altaica, commonly known as the high-altitude cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its small, yellowish flowers are followed by fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Conyza altaica is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing, mat-forming structure to withstand harsh alpine conditions."
