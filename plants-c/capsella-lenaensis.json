    "intro": "Capsella lenaensis, commonly known as the Lena morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is native to regions of northern Europe and parts of Asia, where it typically grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually white or pale purple, blooming in the early spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Capsella lenaensis is primarily of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and its potential as a model organism for studying plant adaptation."
