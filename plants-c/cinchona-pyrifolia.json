    "intro": "Cinchona pyrifolia, commonly known as the fire-leaf quinine tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, large, lobed leaves that resemble the shape of a fire. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries containing seeds. It is notable for its historical use in the production of quinine, a compound used to treat malaria. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native range."
