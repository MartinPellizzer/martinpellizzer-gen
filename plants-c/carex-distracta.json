    "intro": "Carex distracta, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spadix-like inflorescences. Native to wetlands and moist soils in North America, it thrives in environments with consistent moisture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in suitable habitats."
