    "intro": "Cannabis sativa subvar. indica, commonly known as Indian hemp, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Asia, Europe, and North America. It is characterized by its broad leaves, short stature, and compact growth habit compared to other cannabis subspecies. The plant contains a variety of cannabinoids, including tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), which are responsible for its psychoactive and therapeutic properties. Indica strains are often associated with sedative effects and are used for relaxation and pain relief. Botanically, it is classified under the Cannabaceae family and is a dioecious species, meaning it has separate male and female plants."
