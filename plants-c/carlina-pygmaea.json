    "intro": "Carlina pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf thistle, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with a compact rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, pale purple to white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spherical shape. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited range and specific environmental requirements, Carlina pygmaea is considered a rare and delicate species."
