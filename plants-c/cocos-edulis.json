    "intro": "Cocos edulis, commonly known as the coconut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It produces a large, fibrous fruit that contains both a liquid endosperm and a solid husk. The botanical structure includes a tall trunk with a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The fruit, or coconut, develops from an inferior ovary and contains a single seed enclosed in a hard shell. This plant is notable for its ability to thrive in coastal and saline environments."
