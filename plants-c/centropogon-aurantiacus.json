    "intro": "Centropogon aurantiacus, commonly known as the orange-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear bright orange to reddish-brown flowers, which are often mistaken for grasses due to their appearance. Centropogon aurantiacus typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, particularly in regions with humid climates."
