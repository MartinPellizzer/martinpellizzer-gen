    "intro": "Crataegus serrulata, commonly known as the serrated hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to elliptic leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red to orange berries that are edible for birds and small mammals but are generally not consumed by humans. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodlands, thickets, and along stream banks."
