    "intro": "Caroxylon imbricatum var. imbricatum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with woody stems and broad, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. The species is well-suited to xerophytic environments and is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
