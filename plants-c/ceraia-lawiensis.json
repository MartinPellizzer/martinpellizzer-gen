    "intro": "Ceraia lawiensis, commonly known as the Lawai fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, including spores, are produced on the underside of the fronds. Ceraia lawiensis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
