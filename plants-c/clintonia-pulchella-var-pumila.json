It features a low-growing habit with clustered, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that form a dense rosette near the ground. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in rich, humusy soils. Its botanical characteristics make it a desirable addition to native plant gardens and woodland landscapes."
