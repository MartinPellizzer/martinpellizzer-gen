    "intro": "Cerasus nicotianaefolia, commonly known as the Japanese cherry plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the Prunus genus and is characterized by its fragrant, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, sweet fruits that are edible but not as widely cultivated as other cherry species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often grown for ornamental purposes due to its beautiful floral display. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in autumn, adding to its seasonal appeal."
