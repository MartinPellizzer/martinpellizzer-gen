It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces striking purple or white flowers, though they are often less showy than its foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade. This variety is also valued for its edible corms, which are a staple in many cuisines."
