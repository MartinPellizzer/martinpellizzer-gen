    "intro": "Cerastium graminifolium, commonly known as the grass-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early to mid-summer, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. Cerastium graminifolium is often found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
