    "intro": "Chasmatophyllum nelii, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its rosette of velvety, waxy leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, often with contrasting centers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Chasmatophyllum nelii is popular as a houseplant due to its compact size and ability to bloom year-round under proper care."
