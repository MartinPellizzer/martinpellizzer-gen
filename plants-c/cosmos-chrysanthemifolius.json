It features feathery, silver-green leaves that resemble those of chrysanthemums, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, daisy-like yellow flowers with white centers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators make it both ornamental and ecologically beneficial."
