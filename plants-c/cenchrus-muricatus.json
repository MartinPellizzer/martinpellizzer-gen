    "intro": "Cenchrus muricatus, commonly known as the rigid grass or prickly grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and stiff, ribbed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
