    "intro": "Coleosanthus lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
