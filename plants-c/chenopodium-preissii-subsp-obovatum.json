    "intro": "Chenopodium preissii subsp. obovatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf goosefoot, is a species of flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to obovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, and it is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It is native to regions of Australia and is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
