    "intro": "Carex rubrobrunnea var. elineolata, commonly known as the red-bronze sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
