It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. Its botanical characteristics make it notable for its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties. However, it is relatively uncommon in cultivation due to its specific environmental requirements."
