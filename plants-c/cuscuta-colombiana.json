    "intro": "Cuscuta colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to South America and is often found growing on a variety of host species, including shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity. Cuscuta colombiana plays a role in ecological interactions, though its parasitic nature can sometimes harm its host plants."
