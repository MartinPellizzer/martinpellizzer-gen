It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Centrolepis polygona is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
