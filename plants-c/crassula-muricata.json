    "intro": "Crassula muricata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for indoor cultivation. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
