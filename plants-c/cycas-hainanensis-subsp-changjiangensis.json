    "intro": "Cycas hainanensis subsp. changjiangensis, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a rare cycad species native to southern China. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces cones, with male cones typically appearing at the base of the trunk and female cones emerging higher up. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this subspecies is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
