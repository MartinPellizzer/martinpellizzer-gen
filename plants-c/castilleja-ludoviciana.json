    "intro": "Castilleja ludoviciana, commonly known as the Ludovician milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas, often forming dense colonies. Its roots penetrate the roots of neighboring plants, drawing nutrients and water, which is a common trait among hemiparasitic species. Castilleja ludoviciana plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain insects and small animals."
