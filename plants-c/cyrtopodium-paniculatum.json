    "intro": "Cyrtopodium paniculatum, commonly known as the panicled corymb orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and prefers well-drained soil. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in seasonal conditions. Cyrtopodium paniculatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
