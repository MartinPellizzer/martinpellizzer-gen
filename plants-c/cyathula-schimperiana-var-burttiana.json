    "intro": "Cyathula schimperiana var. burttiana, commonly known as the Burtt's spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers, which are often surrounded by a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and floral arrangement compared to the typical form of Cyathula schimperiana."
