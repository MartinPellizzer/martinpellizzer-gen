    "intro": "Cotoneaster saxatilis, commonly known as the rock cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, reddish-orange berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in gardens and rocky landscapes. Cotoneaster saxatilis is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
