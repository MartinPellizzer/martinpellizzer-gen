    "intro": "Comandra umbellata var. decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent comandra, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its stems are prostrate or decumbent, meaning they lie flat on the ground before rising, which helps it conserve moisture. The flowers are yellow and occur in dense, umbrella-like clusters, making it a distinctive and ornamental species."
