    "intro": "Cheilanthes acrostica, commonly known as the rock fern or cliff brake, is a perennial fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically gray-green in color and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is often found growing on cliffs or in crevices. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to anchor itself in difficult substrates. Cheilanthes acrostica is well adapted to dry conditions and is considered a drought-tolerant species."
