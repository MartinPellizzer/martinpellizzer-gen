    "intro": "Catasetum \u00d7 splendens var. rubiginosum, commonly known as the red-stained orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, often red or orange-pink flowers, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers have a distinctive, modified lip that is often hairy or glandular, aiding in pollination by specific insects. The variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in warm, humid environments."
