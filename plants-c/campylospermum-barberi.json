    "intro": "Campylospermum barberi, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, grayish-brown bark and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in drought conditions. Its botanical features make it an important species in xerophytic ecosystems."
