    "intro": "Centotheca longilamina, commonly known as the long-leaf centotheca, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in umbels, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Centotheca longilamina is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
