    "intro": "Crotalaria latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and palmate leaves. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a forage crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its seeds are edible, though some parts of the plant contain toxic alkaloids. Crotalaria latifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in disturbed habitats."
