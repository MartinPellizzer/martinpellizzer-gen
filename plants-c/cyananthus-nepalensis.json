    "intro": "Cyananthus nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
