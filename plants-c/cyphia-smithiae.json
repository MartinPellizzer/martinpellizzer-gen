    "intro": "Cyphia smithiae, commonly known as the Smith's cyphia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its vivid purple and white flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a compact, terrestrial growth habit with fleshy, strap-like leaves that store moisture, adapting it to its high-altitude environment. Cyphia smithiae thrives in cool, shaded areas with high humidity, often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
