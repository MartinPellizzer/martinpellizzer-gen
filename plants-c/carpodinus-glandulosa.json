    "intro": "Carpodinus glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular carpet grass, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features a low-growing habit with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive glandular surface that gives it its scientific name. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in humid environments."
