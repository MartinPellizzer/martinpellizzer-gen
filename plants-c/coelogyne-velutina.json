    "intro": "Coelogyne velutina, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple and green petals and its fragrant, long-lasting flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Coelogyne velutina is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique floral display."
