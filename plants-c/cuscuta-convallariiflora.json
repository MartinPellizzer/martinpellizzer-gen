    "intro": "Cuscuta convallariiflora, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless stems. The plant attaches to its host using specialized root-like structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is often found on plants such as morning glory and other members of the Convolvulaceae family. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and survival of its host, making it an important ecological component in certain ecosystems."
