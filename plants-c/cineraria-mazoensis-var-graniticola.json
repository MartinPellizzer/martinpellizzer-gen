    "intro": "Cineraria mazoensis var. graniticola, commonly known as the graniticola cineraria, is a rare and striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its large, waxy, blue-gray leaves that are often adorned with fine white hairs. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and blue, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
