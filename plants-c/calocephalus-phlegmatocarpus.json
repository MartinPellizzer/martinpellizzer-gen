    "intro": "Calocephalus phlegmatocarpus, commonly known as the stickyhead cypress, is a member of the Cupressaceae family. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves and small, woody cones. The plant is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the coastal regions of the Gulf of Mexico. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy, sticky substance, which gives it its common name. This unique botanical feature helps the plant retain moisture and resist herbivory."
