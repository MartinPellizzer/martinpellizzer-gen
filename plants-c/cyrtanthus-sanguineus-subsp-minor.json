It produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries. Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for coastal and Mediterranean climates."
