    "intro": "Ctenanthe burle-marxii, commonly known as the Burle Marx arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often variegated with shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden beneath a leaf-like structure called a spathe. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Ctenanthe burle-marxii is a popular houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
