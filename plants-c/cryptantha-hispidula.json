It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. The hairy stems and leaves are characteristic features that help it retain moisture in arid environments."
