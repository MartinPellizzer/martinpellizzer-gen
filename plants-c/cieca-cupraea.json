    "intro": "Cieca cupraea, commonly known as the copper cup fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often tinged with a reddish or copper hue, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Cieca cupraea is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
