    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 glaberrima, commonly known as the rough lemon. It is a hybrid citrus species native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its thorny stems and small, yellow-green leaves. The plant produces small, sour fruits that are typically not consumed by humans but are used in traditional medicine. It is highly cold-tolerant compared to other citrus species, making it suitable for cultivation in cooler climates. The rough lemon is also valued for its ornamental qualities and as a rootstock for grafting other citrus varieties."
