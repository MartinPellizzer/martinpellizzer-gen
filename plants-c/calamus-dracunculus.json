    "intro": "Calamus dracunculus, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features long, slender rhizomes that grow horizontally beneath the water or soil. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that are often hidden among its foliage. Sweet flag is known for its aromatic rhizomes, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic life."
