    "intro": "Colchicum haynaldii, commonly known as the Haynald's colchicum, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a distinctive nodding shape. The plant's leaves are basal, grass-like, and often persist through the winter. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are followed by capsule fruits that release seeds. Colchicum haynaldii is adapted to rocky or dry soils and is often found in open woodland or scrub habitats."
