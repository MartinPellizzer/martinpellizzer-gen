    "intro": "Cirsium litorale, commonly known as sea thistle, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found growing along cliffs and dunes. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss, an adaptation to its harsh coastal environment. Cirsium litorale plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and provides habitat for various insects and birds."
