It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. The plant features spiny, hairy stems and leaves, with bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its scientific name reflects its striking yellow color and thistle-like appearance. It is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
