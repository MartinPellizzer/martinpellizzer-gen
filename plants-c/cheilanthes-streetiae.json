    "intro": "Cheilanthes streetiae, commonly known as the street's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with a dense cluster of lance-shaped, evergreen fronds. Its leaves are usually light green and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It is native to parts of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
