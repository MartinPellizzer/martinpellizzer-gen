    "intro": "Cydonia chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese quince, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange to reddish-brown, berry-like fruits. The plant is characterized by its rough, thorny bark and pinnate leaves with serrated edges. The fruits are often used in traditional Chinese medicine and culinary applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
