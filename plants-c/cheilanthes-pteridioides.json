    "intro": "Cheilanthes pteridioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and leathery, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its fronds are typically evergreen, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
