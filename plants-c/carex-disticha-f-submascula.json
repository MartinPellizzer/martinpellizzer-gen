    "intro": "Carex disticha f. submascula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a variant of the narrow-leaved sedge native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
