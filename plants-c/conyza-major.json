    "intro": "Conyza major, commonly known as the greater cocklebur, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are grouped in clusters, followed by spiny, spherical fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Conyza major is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
