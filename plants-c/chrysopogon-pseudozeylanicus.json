It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
