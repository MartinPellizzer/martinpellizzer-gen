It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-shaped inflorescence called a cyathium. The plant features small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged around a central cup-like structure, which is a unique botanical feature. Its leaves are typically broad and have a rough, hairy texture, contributing to its common name. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands."
