    "intro": "Cereus malletianus, commonly known as the Mallet's candleplant, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming at night. Its stems are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
