It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Vietnam and Cambodia. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species in botanical studies."
