It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
