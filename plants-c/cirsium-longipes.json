    "intro": "Cirsium longipes, commonly known as the long-footed thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are spiny and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The flowers, which bloom in late summer, are typically purple or pink and are surrounded by bracts that give the plant its distinctive appearance."
