    "intro": "Cypripedium ludlowii, commonly known as the Ludlow's lady's tresses, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it forms a dense mat of leaves and roots. Its flowers are arranged in a loose spiral and are often pink or white in color. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in its natural range."
