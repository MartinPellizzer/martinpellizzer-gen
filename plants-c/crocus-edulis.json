    "intro": "Crocus edulis, commonly known as the edible crocus, is a member of the Iridaceae family and is native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with a yellow center. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters and produces underground corms that are the primary part used for consumption. The corms are rich in starch and have a mild, nutty flavor, making them a traditional food source in some regions. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves emerge, and is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its culinary uses."
