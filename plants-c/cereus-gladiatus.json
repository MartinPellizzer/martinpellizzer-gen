    "intro": "Cereus gladiatus, commonly known as the sword cactus, is a species of cactus native to the deserts of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often segmented and covered in white, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, nocturnal flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, blooming only during the evening. It is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements and is drought-tolerant. The plant's structure and growth habits make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
