    "intro": "Cyclosorus subdimorphus, commonly known as the two-formed water moss, is a species of freshwater algae belonging to the order Desmoidales. It is characterized by its filamentous structure, with cells that exhibit dimorphism, meaning they have two distinct forms along the thallus. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its microscopic structure includes a central axis with branching filaments, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. This species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to primary production and serving as a food source for various microorganisms."
