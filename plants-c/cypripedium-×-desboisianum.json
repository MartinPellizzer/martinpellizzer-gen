    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 desboisianum, commonly known as the Desbois hybrid\u6753\u5170, is a hybrid orchid resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium \u00d7 morganianum. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like structure, typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions of Asia. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts, though it is also considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
