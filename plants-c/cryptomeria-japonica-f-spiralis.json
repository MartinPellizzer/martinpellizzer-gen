    "intro": "Cryptomeria japonica f. spiralis, commonly known as the spiral cedar or spiral Japanese cedar, is a unique cultivar of the Japanese cedar tree. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of branches, which gives it an ornamental appearance. This form is a natural mutation of the typical Cryptomeria japonica, exhibiting a more compact and twisted growth pattern. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are dark green and provide a dense canopy. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
