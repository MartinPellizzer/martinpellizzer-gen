    "intro": "Clusia scrobiculata, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, dark green leaves that are typically leathery and have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments. Clusia scrobiculata is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and is relatively low-maintenance in cultivation."
