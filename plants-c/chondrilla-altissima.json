    "intro": "Chondrilla altissima, commonly known as the tall milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets, and its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid landscapes."
