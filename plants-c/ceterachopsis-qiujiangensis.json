    "intro": "Ceterachopsis qiujiangensis, commonly known as the Qiujiang sea holly, is a rare marine flowering plant native to the coastal regions of China. It belongs to the family Ceterachopsideae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, and often branched structure. The plant is adapted to thrive in intertidal zones, where it withstands periodic submersion and exposure to saltwater. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a unique morphology that aids in its reproductive strategy. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
