    "intro": "Cirsium falconeri var. horrida, commonly known as the Falconeri thistle, is a perennial plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy purple to pink flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a dense, spherical inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
