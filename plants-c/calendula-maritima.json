    "intro": "Calendula maritima, commonly known as sea marigold, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in summer and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline environments, making it a hardy species along shorelines. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the stems are often covered in fine, white hairs. Calendula maritima is also known for its medicinal properties, with historical use in traditional remedies."
