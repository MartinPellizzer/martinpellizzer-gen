    "intro": "Cebatha orbiculata f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leafed cebatha, is a variant of the cebatha plant characterized by its notably larger leaves compared to the typical form. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. The plant features rounded, orbicular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in inflorescences that bloom in the spring. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
