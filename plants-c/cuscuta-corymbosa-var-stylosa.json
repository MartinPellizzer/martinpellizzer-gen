    "intro": "Cuscuta corymbosa var. stylosa, commonly known as the long-styled dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on a variety of hosts, including grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host, forming a symbiotic relationship. Its flowers typically bloom in clusters, and the variety is distinguished by its elongated stamens. This species is native to various regions in North America and is considered an invasive weed in some agricultural settings."
