It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and large, elliptical leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, orange-colored fruits that resemble apples. The fruits contain a single seed surrounded by a sweet, fleshy pulp. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in its native habitat."
