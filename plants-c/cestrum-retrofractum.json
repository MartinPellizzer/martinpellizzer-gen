    "intro": "Cestrum retrofractum, commonly known as the fragrant nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries, which are orange-red when ripe, are toxic to humans and animals, making the plant both beautiful and potentially dangerous. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal but requires careful handling due to its toxic properties."
