    "intro": "Clidemia ferox, commonly known as the velvetleaf or tropical nettle, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are often overlooked due to its dense foliage. Clidemia ferox is an invasive species in many regions, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats make it a significant ecological concern."
