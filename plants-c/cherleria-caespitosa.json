    "intro": "Cherleria caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and woodland edges. The plant forms dense, clump-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or pale yellow and appear in late spring to early summer. Cherleria caespitosa is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its role in supporting local insect populations."
