    "intro": "Croton odoratus, commonly known as the fragrant croton, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that come in a variety of colors, including green, red, and yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens in tropical and subtropical regions."
