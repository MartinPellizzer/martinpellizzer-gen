It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white, spathaceous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland edges. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
