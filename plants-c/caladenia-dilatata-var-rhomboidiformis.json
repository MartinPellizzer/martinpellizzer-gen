    "intro": "Caladenia dilatata var. rhomboidiformis, commonly known as the Rhomboid Spider-orchid, is a striking orchid species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and distinctive, spider-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It blooms during the cooler months, usually between June and August, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. This variety is noted for its unique floral morphology and is a subject of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological and evolutionary significance."
