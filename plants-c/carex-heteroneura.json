    "intro": "Carex heteroneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedges, is a species of sedge native to North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and a flowering spike that produces small, three-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Carex heteroneura is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in disturbed environments."
