    "intro": "Chondropetalum deustum, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant grows in rocky, coastal environments, often on cliffs or among boulders. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to anchor itself in fissures and crevices. The fronds are usually dark green and have a smooth, glossy appearance, with spore-producing structures located on the underside."
