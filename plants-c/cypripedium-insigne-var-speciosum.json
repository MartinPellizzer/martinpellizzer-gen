    "intro": "Cypripedium insigne var. speciosum, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination trap. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive adequate light without direct sun exposure. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
