    "intro": "Crataegus tenera, commonly known as the Mexican hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring thorned branches and small, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in clusters during spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem, simple leaves, and a preference for well-drained soils in full sun. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in arid climates."
