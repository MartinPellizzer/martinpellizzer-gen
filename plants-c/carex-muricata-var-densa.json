It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
