It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically narrow and alternate along the stem. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds, often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry or semi-arid environments. Its ornamental value is also appreciated due to its bright yellow flowers."
