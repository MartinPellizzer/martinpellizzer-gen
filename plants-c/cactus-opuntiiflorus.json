    "intro": "Cactus opuntiiflorus, commonly known as the red-tipped cactus, is a species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spiny areoles, which are clusters of spines and flowers. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the late afternoon. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Opuntiiflorus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
