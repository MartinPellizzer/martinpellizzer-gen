    "intro": "Corybas cerasinus, commonly known as the red globemoss, is a unique orchid species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its striking red, globular flowers that resemble small berries, which are a distinctive feature of the genus Corybas. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a short, stocky stem and fleshy, ovate leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest floors or rock crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
