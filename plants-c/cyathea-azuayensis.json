    "intro": "Cyathea azuayensis, commonly known as the Azuay tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the humid forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, with a thick, fibrous root system that helps it anchor in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its fronds are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to three meters, contributing to its ornamental value. Cyathea azuayensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
