    "intro": "Cyrtochilum colobium, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a species of orchid native to the humid forests of South America. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like structure formed by the fusion of its petals and sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are small and often pale green or yellow, adapted to attract specific pollinators. Cyrtochilum colobium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
