    "intro": "Caesalpinia compressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burr legume, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves with narrow, elongated leaflets and bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces woody, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind or animals. Caesalpinia compressa is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or disturbed habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration and traditional medicine."
