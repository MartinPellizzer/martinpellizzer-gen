    "intro": "Crassocephalum pubigerum, commonly known as the hairy-headed sunflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
