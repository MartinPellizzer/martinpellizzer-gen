    "intro": "Conium leiocarpum, commonly known as the smooth-hairy hemlock, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and umbrella-shaped inflorescences. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, typically growing in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that develop into small, dry fruits called schizocarps. Its leaves and stems contain toxic compounds, including alkaloids, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. Due to its resemblance to edible plants, it is often mistaken for safe species, leading to accidental poisonings."
