    "intro": "Cupaniopsis aneityensis, commonly known as the rock fig, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its rough, often fissured bark and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. The rock fig is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
