    "intro": "Cousinia eriotricha, commonly known as the silverleaf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It has a compact, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it conserve moisture and reduce water loss. Cousinia eriotricha is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
