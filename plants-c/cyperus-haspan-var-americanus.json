    "intro": "Cyperus haspan var. americanus, commonly known as the American flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other aquatic habitats. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
