    "intro": "Chaetoseris hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy chaetoseris, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is typically low-growing, with hairy stems and leaves adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Its small, yellow flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Chaetoseris hirsuta is often found in rocky soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
