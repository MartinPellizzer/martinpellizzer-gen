    "intro": "Carex eriandrolepis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Carex eriandrolepis is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
