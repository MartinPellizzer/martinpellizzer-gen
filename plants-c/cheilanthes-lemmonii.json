    "intro": "Cheilanthes lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the Polypodiaceae family. It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with thick, leathery fronds that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. This resilient fern is often found in rocky habitats across the southwestern United States and northern Mexico."
