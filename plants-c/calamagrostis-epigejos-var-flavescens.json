    "intro": "Calamagrostis epigejos var. flavescens, commonly known as the golden bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and vibrant golden foliage that turns coppery in the fall. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Its ornamental value comes from its showy, panicle-like inflorescences that appear in late summer. It is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
