    "intro": "Cuscuta stenocalycina, commonly known as the narrow calyx dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and its seeds are dispersed by wind or animals. The plant has a vine-like structure with numerous small branches that attach to host plants using specialized suckers. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it can rapidly deplete the host's resources. Cuscuta stenocalycina is found in various habitats across the Americas and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
