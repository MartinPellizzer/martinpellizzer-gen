    "intro": "Corybas boholensis, commonly known as the Bohol helmet orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Philippines. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flower that resembles a miniature helmet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
