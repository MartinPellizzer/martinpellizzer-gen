    "intro": "Cryptosorus blechnoides, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with lanceolate, serrated fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are found on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Cryptosorus blechnoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, nutrient-poor soils."
