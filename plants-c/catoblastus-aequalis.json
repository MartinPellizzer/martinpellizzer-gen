    "intro": "Catoblastus aequalis, commonly known as the velvetleaf. It is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Catoblastus aequalis is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
