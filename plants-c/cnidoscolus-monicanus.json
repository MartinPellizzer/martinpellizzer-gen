    "intro": "Cnidoscolus monicanus, commonly known as the Mexican stinging leaf or horse bean plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that often have a waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish flowers followed by edible, bean-like fruits that contain a single seed. Its leaves contain irritants such as acrid compounds, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. Despite its defensive properties, it is cultivated in some regions for its ornamental value and as a source of traditional medicine."
