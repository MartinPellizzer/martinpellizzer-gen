    "intro": "Cameraria orientensis, commonly known as the oriental leaf miner, is a small moth species belonging to the family Lyonetiidae. Its larvae are notorious for feeding on the leaves of various plants, particularly those in the Rosaceae family, such as apples and cherries. The larvae create distinctive serpentine mines within the leaf tissue, which can significantly impact the plant's photosynthetic ability. The adult moths are tiny, with wingspan rarely exceeding 5 millimeters, and are often difficult to detect. This species is widely distributed in temperate regions and is considered a pest in agricultural and horticultural settings."
