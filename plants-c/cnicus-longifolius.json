    "intro": "Cnicus longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cnicus longifolius is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in harsh environments."
