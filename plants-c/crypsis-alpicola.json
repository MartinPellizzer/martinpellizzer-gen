    "intro": "Crypsis alpicola, commonly known as the alpine crypt, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant exhibits a low-growing habit, with small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are finely divided and adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Crypsis alpicola is considered a vulnerable species."
