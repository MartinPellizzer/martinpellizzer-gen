    "intro": "Colysis regularis, commonly known as the regular colysis, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and features small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to cream. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and linear, arranged in a rosette pattern to conserve moisture. It blooms during the cooler months, adapting to its harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
