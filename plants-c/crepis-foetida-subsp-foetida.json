    "intro": "Crepis foetida subsp. foetida, commonly known as stinking sowthistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, with slender, often hairy stems and alternate, spoon-shaped leaves that are usually hairy beneath. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single head, which are borne on slender peduncles. Its leaves and stems emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which is a characteristic feature of the species. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas."
