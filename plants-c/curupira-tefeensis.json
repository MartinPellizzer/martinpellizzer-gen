    "intro": "Curupira tefeensis, commonly known as the Tefe poison arrow frog, is a small amphibian native to the Amazon rainforest of Peru. It belongs to the family Dendrobatidae, which includes many brightly colored poison dart frogs. The species is characterized by its striking yellow and black coloration, which serves as a warning to potential predators about its toxic secretions. Its skin secretes a potent alkaloid called tefelin, which has been studied for its medicinal properties. Curupira tefeensis plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its habitat and is an important indicator species for the health of the rainforest."
