    "intro": "Chenopodium lanuginosum, commonly known as lamb's-quarters, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that develop into dry, three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in cultivated areas. Chenopodium lanuginosum is also known for its edible leaves, which have a slightly salty flavor and are used in some traditional cuisines."
