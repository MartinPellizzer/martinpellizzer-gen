    "intro": "Centaurella moseri, commonly known as the narrowleaf centaurella, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, facilitating its spread across open habitats. Centaurella moseri is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in conditions with limited water availability."
