    "intro": "Centropogon pilalensis, commonly known as the Pilal\u00e9n Island grass, is a flowering plant native to the island of Pilal\u00e9n in the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, white to pale green florets. It thrives in coastal and sandy habitats, adapted to the arid and saline conditions of its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Centropogon pilalensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
