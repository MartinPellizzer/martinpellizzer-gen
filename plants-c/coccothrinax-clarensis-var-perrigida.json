    "intro": "Coccothrinax clarensis var. perrigida, commonly known as the Perrigida palm, is a flowering plant species native to the Caribbean. It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in coastal and dry forest habitats, often growing in sandy or limestone soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
