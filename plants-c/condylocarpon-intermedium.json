    "intro": "Condylocarpon intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate condylocarpon, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish-yellow in color and has a leathery texture. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found on bark and wood in temperate forest environments. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and specialized species."
