    "intro": "Callostylis cyrtosepala, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a perennial herb with a sprawling growth habit, characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, which are typically borne on long, slender peduncles. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Callostylis cyrtosepala is often found in coastal and inland dunes, contributing to the ecological stability of these environments."
