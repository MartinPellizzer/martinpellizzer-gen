These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of broad, lance-shaped leaves and their showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in spring. The flowers are usually green or reddish in color and are clustered in umbels, giving the plant a distinctive appearance.

They are often found in moist, woodland habitats and are known for their ornamental value in gardens."
