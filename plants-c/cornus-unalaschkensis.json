    "intro": "Cornus unalaschkensis, commonly known as the Alaska dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant produces red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Cornus unalaschkensis is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions."
