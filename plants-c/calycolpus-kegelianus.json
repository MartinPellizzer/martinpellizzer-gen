    "intro": "Calycolpus kegelianus, commonly known as the Kegelian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia, and thrives in tropical rainforests. Due to its specialized growth habit and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
