    "intro": "Cicuta maculata var. victorinii, commonly known as the spotted water hemlock, is a toxic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems with purple spots and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is often considered one of the most dangerous plants in the region."
