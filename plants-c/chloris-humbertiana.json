It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lipped flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural environment."
