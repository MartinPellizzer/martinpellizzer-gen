    "intro": "Carduus nebraskensis, commonly known as the Nebraska thistle, is a perennial plant native to the central United States. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and along roadsides. It has a robust root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. The Nebraska thistle plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
