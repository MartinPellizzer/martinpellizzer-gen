    "intro": "Calathea valeriana, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with intricate patterns and shades of green, silver, and pink. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, and they often fold shut at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
