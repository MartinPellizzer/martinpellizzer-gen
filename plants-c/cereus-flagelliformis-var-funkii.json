    "intro": "Cereus flagelliformis var. funkii, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful floral display, which appears at night and lasts only a few days. The plant has a short, thick stem with spines, and its flowers are typically pink, red, or yellow. It is a hybrid plant, often grafted onto a hardy rootstock to enhance its survival in harsh conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular in horticulture but requires careful care to thrive."
