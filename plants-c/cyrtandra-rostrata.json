    "intro": "Cyrtandra rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated heliconia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescence that resembles a bird's beak, hence its common name. The plant produces vibrant, colorful bracts that surround its small, clustered flowers, which are typically white or yellow. Cyrtandra rostrata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its unique floral structure makes it an important plant for pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
