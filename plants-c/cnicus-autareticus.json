    "intro": "Cnicus autareticus, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. The plant features basal rosettes of leaves and produces yellow flowers in early summer. Its flowers are borne on long, slender stems and are arranged in a single inflorescence. The species is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions."
