    "intro": "Coffea resinosa, commonly known as the resinous coffee plant, is a species native to the tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and broad, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into red, fleshy fruits containing seeds used for coffee production. Its unique feature is the secretion of a resinous substance, which gives it its common name and contributes to its ecological and medicinal significance. Coffea resinosa is also valued for its ornamental qualities and potential in sustainable agriculture."
