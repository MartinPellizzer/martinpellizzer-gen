    "intro": "Chrysosplenium rhabdospermum, commonly known as the mountain foamflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats and features rhizomatous growth that allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cool, humid environment. Chrysosplenium rhabdospermum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
