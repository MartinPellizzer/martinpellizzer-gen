    "intro": "Cystopteris setosa, commonly known as the hairy bladder fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. Cystopteris setosa is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
