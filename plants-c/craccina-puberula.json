    "intro": "Craccina puberula, commonly known as the hairy craccus, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in fields, and thrives in full sun. The plant has slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and also bear a hairy texture, contributing to its overall rugged appearance."
