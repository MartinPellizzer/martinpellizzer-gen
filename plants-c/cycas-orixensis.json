    "intro": "Cycas orixensis, commonly known as the Orixan cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones ovoid and woody. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss, Cycas orixensis is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
