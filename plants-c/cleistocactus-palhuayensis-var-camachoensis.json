    "intro": "Cleistocactus palhuayensis var. camachoensis, commonly known as the Camacho's closed-cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular or cylindrical stem that often develops a reddish or purple hue. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
