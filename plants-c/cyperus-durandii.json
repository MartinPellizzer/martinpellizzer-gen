It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic habitats. It has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often inconspicuous. Cyperus durandii is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its ability to thrive in water and its aesthetic appearance."
