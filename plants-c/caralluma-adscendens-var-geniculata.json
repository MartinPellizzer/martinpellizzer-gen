    "intro": "Caralluma adscendens var. geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag prickly pear, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan. It is characterized by its branching, spiny stems that form a shrub-like structure, often growing in a zigzag pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. This species is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems."
