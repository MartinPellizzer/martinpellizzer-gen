    "intro": "Columnea urbanii, commonly known as the Urban's flame flower, is a species of flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and glossy, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Columnea urbanii is valued in horticulture for its striking floral display and is relatively easy to cultivate in warm, humid environments."
