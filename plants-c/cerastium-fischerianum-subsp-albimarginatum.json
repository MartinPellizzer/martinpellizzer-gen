    "intro": "Cerastium fischerianum subsp. albimarginatum, commonly known as the white-margin chickweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically features slender, upright stems with opposite leaves that are hairy and often have a white marginal stripe, giving it its common name. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
