    "intro": "Carex sclerocarpa, commonly known as the hard-shelled sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wetland or marshy environments. The hard, woody capsules of its fruit are a distinguishing botanical feature."
