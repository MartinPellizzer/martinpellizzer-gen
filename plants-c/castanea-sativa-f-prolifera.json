    "intro": "Castanea sativa f. prolifera, commonly known as the European chestnut tree, is a cultivar of the sweet chestnut native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, spreading growth habit and the production of large, edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in autumn, and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in European agriculture. Due to its susceptibility to chestnut blight, it requires careful cultivation and management."
