It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The fronds are typically bright green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, feather-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in dense tropical forests. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
