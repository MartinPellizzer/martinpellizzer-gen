    "intro": "Carex davalliana var. squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly sedge, is a perennial plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive, fluffy bracts that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and stream sides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets that are often covered in a fuzzy layer."
