    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris var. minor, commonly known as the lesser common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-30 centimeters and thrives in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and gardens. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive bur-like structure, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. This variety is closely related to the common chickweed but is distinguished by its smaller size and slightly different leaf morphology."
