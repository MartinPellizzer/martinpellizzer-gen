    "intro": "Cassia burmanni, commonly known as Burmann's cassia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and produces yellow, fluffy inflorescences that are often used in traditional medicine. Cassia burmanni thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open forests or along riverbanks. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution."
