    "intro": "Centhriscus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, often blue or purple, ray flowers and spiky, bristly leaves. Centhriscus species are typically found in coastal areas and saline soils, adapting to harsh, maritime environments. They have a compact growth habit and are often used in ornamental gardening for their unique appearance. The genus includes several species, such as Centhriscus acanthocarpus and Centhriscus spinosus, which are valued for their hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
