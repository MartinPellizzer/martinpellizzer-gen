    "intro": "Cyclas spicata, commonly known as the spiny cycad, is a species of cycad native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being clustered at the base of the plant and the female cones emerging from the stem. Cyclas spicata is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
