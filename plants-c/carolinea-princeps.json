    "intro": "Carolinea princeps, commonly known as the royal carolinea, is a rare and striking member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, attracting specific pollinators such as hummingbirds. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a slightly waxy texture. Carolinea princeps thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot."
