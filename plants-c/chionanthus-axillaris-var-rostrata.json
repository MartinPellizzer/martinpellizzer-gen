    "intro": "Chionanthus axillaris var. rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated fringeflower, is a rare and unique variant of the fringeflower genus. It is native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding ornamental value to its habitat. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a delicate and seldom-seen species in botanical collections."
