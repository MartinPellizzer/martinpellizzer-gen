    "intro": "Castanea microcarpa, commonly known as the California black walnut. It is a deciduous tree native to the western United States, characterized by its dark, ridged bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by spiny husks enclosing edible nuts. Its nuts are encased in a thick, woody shell and are highly valued for their flavor and oil content. The plant is also notable for its ecological importance, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
