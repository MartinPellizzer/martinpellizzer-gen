    "intro": "Chamaegastrodia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, pale green or brownish inflorescence, which resembles a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Chamaegastrodia is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
