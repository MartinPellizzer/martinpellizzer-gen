    "intro": "Commiphora calciicola, commonly known as the limestone myrrh tree, is a rare and unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces a resinous sap that has been used traditionally for medicinal purposes. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often growing on limestone outcrops. Its ability to survive in harsh, dry environments makes it an important species in its ecological niche. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
