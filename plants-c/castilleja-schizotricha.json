    "intro": "Castilleja schizotricha, commonly known as the narrowleaf paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to red tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on host plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open habitats like meadows and grasslands, often in association with other members of the Orobanchaceae family. Its unique floral structure and ecological interactions make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
