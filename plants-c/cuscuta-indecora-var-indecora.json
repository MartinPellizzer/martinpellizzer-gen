    "intro": "Cuscuta indecora var. indecora, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and can be found growing on a variety of agricultural and wild plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants."
