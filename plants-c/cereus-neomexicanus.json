    "intro": "Cereus neomexicanus, commonly known as the New Mexico cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, spiny stem that can grow up to several meters in height. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, blooming at night, which is a common trait among many species in the Cereus genus. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
