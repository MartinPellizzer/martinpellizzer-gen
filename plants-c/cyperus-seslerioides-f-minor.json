    "intro": "Cyperus seslerioides f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf sedges, is a compact, herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
