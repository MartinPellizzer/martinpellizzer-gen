    "intro": "Cinchona subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds, and it is known for its medicinal properties, particularly the presence of quinine in its bark. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Cinchona subsessilis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
