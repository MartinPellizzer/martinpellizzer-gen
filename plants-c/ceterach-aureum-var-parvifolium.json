    "intro": "Ceterach aureum var. parvifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved golden moss, is a coastal plant native to southern Australia. It is a low-growing, mat-forming species that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, golden coating, giving it its common name. It is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy member of the rockwallaceae family. This variety is often found in association with other pioneer species in coastal dune ecosystems."
