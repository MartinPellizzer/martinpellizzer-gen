The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, tubular flowers surrounded by pale blue bracts. Centaurea prespana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also of ecological importance in its native habitat."
