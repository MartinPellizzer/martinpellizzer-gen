    "intro": "Calea tomentosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Mexican heather, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Calea tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
