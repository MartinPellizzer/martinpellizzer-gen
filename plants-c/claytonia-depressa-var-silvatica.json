    "intro": "Claytonia depressa var. silvatica, commonly known as the woodland spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features rosettes of oval, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, showy white or pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stalks above the foliage. Its flowers have five petals and are typically arranged in a cluster, with five stamens and a single pistil. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense mats of foliage."
