    "intro": "Cyclophyllum memaoyaense, commonly known as the Memaoya cycad, is a rare cycad species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
