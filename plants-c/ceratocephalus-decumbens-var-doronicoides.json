    "intro": "Ceratocephalus decumbens var. doronicoides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with a sprawling, cushion-like habit, featuring dense clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant has silver-green, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Its flowers bloom in early spring, producing a distinctive, flattened seed head that aids in wind dispersal. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, sandy soils and its role in supporting local pollinators."
