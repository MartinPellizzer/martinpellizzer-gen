    "intro": "Carex antucensis, commonly known as the Antuco sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia. This perennial plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in high-altitude grasslands and forest edges. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered flowers during the spring and summer seasons. Carex antucensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native environment."
