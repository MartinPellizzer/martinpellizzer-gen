    "intro": "Cyperus hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the tropical regions of China, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swampy areas and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Cyperus hainanensis produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
