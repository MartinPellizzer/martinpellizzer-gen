    "intro": "Ctenanthe amabilis, commonly known as the velvetleaf caladium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and red. The plant thrives in humid, warm environments and prefers indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its foliage is the main ornamental feature, as it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are rarely seen. Ctenanthe amabilis is relatively easy to care for, requiring well-draining soil and consistent moisture to flourish."
