    "intro": "Closia pusilla, commonly known as the small clover mite, is a tiny plant-feeding arthropod, not a true plant. It belongs to the family Tetranychidae and is often found on the undersides of leaves, feeding on plant sap. While not a plant itself, it can cause damage to crops and ornamental plants by weakening them. Its presence is often indicated by the webbing and stippling it leaves on foliage. Closia pusilla thrives in warm, dry conditions and is more prevalent in agricultural settings."
