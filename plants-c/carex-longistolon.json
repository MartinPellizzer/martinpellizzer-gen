    "intro": "Carex longistolon, commonly known as the long-stoloned sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are long and stoloniferous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Carex longistolon is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
