    "intro": "Calceolaria violacea, commonly known as the violet cup, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive violet-colored, cup-shaped flowers that resemble small violas. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates, often in rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather conditions. Calceolaria violacea is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
