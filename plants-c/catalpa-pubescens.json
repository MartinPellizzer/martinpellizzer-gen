    "intro": "Catalpa pubescens, commonly known as the downy catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The tree produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in clusters of 4 to 6. Its fruit is a long, slender pod that splits open to release winged seeds. Catalpa pubescens is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas."
