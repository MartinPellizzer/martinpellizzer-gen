    "intro": "Chamaenerion denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed fireweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems that often grow in moist, open habitats. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Chamaenerion denticulatum is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and disturbed sites, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
