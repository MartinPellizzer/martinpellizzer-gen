    "intro": "Convallaria polygonatum, commonly known as the Chinese lily or autumn lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features a rhizomatous root system and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pinkish flowers in late summer to early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. Its flowers are typically 2\u20134 cm in length and have a distinctive, slightly fragrant aroma. Convallaria polygonatum is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits, though it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
