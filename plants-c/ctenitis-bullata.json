    "intro": "Ctenitis bullata, commonly known as the bullate holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into soft, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. Ctenitis bullata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
