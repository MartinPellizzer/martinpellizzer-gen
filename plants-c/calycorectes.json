    "intro": "Calycorectes, commonly known as the \"sac-like flower\" or \"sac flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, where the calyx and corolla are fused into a single, sac-like structure that encloses the reproductive organs. The plant typically has simple, alternate leaves with a hairy surface, and its flowers are usually small and clustered in inflorescences. Calycorectes species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments. These plants are of interest in botanical studies due to their specialized morphology and ecological adaptations."
