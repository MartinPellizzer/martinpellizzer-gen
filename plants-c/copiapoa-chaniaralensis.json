It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed stem that can grow up to two meters in height. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, typically in December to March. It has a dense covering of white spines that help protect it from intense sunlight and reduce water loss. This species is adapted to arid conditions and requires well-draining soil and minimal water."
