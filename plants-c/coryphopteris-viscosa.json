    "intro": "Coryphopteris viscosa, commonly known as the sticky tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound fronds. The fronds are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which gives the plant its common name. This unique feature may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores or help in water retention. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
