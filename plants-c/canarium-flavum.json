    "intro": "Canarium flavum, commonly known as the yellow candlenut, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lanceolate leaves that are usually arranged oppositely. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. Canarium flavum is valued for its oil-rich seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of biodiesel. Its ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for horticultural planting in tropical regions."
