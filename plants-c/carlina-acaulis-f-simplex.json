    "intro": "Carlina acaulis f. simplex, commonly known as the simple-leaved mountain cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and lacks a distinct stem, with all leaves arising directly from the base. The plant features gray-green, woolly leaves that are simple in structure, giving it its specific epithet \"simplex.\" It produces showy, yellow-centered composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
