    "intro": "Conyza patula, commonly known as common weed or white cockleweed, is an annual flowering plant native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers and hairy, alternate leaves. The plant produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in new environments. Conyza patula thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in many regions."
