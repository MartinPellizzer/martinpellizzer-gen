    "intro": "Carex tenax, commonly known as rigid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds and streams. Carex tenax produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
