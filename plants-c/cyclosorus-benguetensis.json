    "intro": "Cyclosorus benguetensis, commonly known as the Benguet cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as streams and ponds. Its reproductive structures are unique, featuring small, spore-producing organs called sporangia. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
