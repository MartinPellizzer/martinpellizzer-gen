    "intro": "Calanthe floresana, commonly known as the Flores orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Flores in Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on decaying organic matter. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Calanthe floresana is considered a vulnerable species."
