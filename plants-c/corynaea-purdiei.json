    "intro": "Corynaea purdiei, commonly known as the yellow sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish-green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous small, dark seeds. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Due to its fragrant properties, it has been historically used in traditional Indigenous practices and for its essential oils."
