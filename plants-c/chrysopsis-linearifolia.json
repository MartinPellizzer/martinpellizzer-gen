    "intro": "Chrysopsis linearifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf everlasting, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its linear, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its foliage remains green throughout the year, making it a popular choice for dried floral arrangements. Chrysopsis linearifolia is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
