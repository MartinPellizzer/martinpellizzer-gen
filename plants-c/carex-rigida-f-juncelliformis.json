    "intro": "Carex rigida f. juncelliformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedges, is a variant of the rigid sedge, characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often found in moist soils along stream banks and wet meadows. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system and narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly curved. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wetland environments."
