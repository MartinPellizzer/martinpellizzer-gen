    "intro": "Colletia montana, commonly known as the mountain candelabra cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its branched, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival in arid environments. Colletia montana is well adapted to rocky and mountainous habitats, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil."
