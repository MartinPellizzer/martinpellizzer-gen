    "intro": "Cassia savannarum, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear bright yellow flowers, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dye. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces oval, woody pods that contain flat, crescent-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and open woodlands. Cassia savannarum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide shade in arid environments."
