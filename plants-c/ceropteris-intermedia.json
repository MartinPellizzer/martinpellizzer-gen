    "intro": "Ceropteris intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi-lobed and have a distinctive, airy appearance. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor, forming dense mats. The plant plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
