    "intro": "Chesneya neplii, commonly known as the Nepli chesneya, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountainous forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers consist of both ray and disk florets, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Chesneya neplii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
