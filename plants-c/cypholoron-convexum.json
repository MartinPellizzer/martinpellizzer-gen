    "intro": "Cypholoron convexum, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is typically found growing on bark or soil in moist, shaded environments. The thallus of Cypholoron convexum is foliose, with a leathery texture and a distinct, convex shape. It lacks true leaves but has a complex system of filaments called rhizines that anchor it to its substrate. This lichen is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
