    "intro": "Crepis bourgeaui, commonly known as the French dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread. The species is sometimes cultivated as a medicinal herb due to its potential health benefits."
