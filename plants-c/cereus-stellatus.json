    "intro": "Cereus stellatus, commonly known as the star cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to South America. It is a low-growing, branching cactus with ribbed stems that are typically green and covered in white, star-shaped spines. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, a characteristic feature of many desert cacti. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Cereus stellatus is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with minimal water."
