    "intro": "Carduus \u00d7 vaillantii, commonly known as the yellow cocklebur. This hybrid plant is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, yellowish-green flowers. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some areas. Its morphology and ecology make it a notable species in both wild and cultivated settings."
