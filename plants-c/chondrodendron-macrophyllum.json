    "intro": "Chondrodendron macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, which float on the water's surface. The plant has a distinctive inflorescence with showy, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its roots form a dense network beneath the water, anchoring it in the muddy substrate. The leaves are thick and waxy, providing buoyancy and protection against herbivores."
