    "intro": "Cinnamomum inunctum var. fulvipilosum, commonly known as the golden-haired cinnamon tree, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Lauraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Vietnam and Laos. The plant is characterized by its distinctive golden-hair-covered leaves and fragrant, bark-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
