    "intro": "Cycnoches ventricosum var. warszewiczii, commonly known as the Warszewicz's cycnoches, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Central America. It is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescence and showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow throat. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous or cloud forest regions. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
