    "intro": "Calathea ovandensis, commonly known as the velvetleaf calathea, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage with intricate patterns of green, silver, and pink. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its native habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant."
