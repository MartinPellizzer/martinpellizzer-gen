    "intro": "Cydista potosina, commonly known as the Potosi cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Cydista potosina is adapted to arid and rocky environments, with a slow growth rate and long lifespan. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
