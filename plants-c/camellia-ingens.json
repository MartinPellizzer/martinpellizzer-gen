    "intro": "Camellia ingens, commonly known as the giant camellia, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, waxy, leathery leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, double or semi-double flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its flowers are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Camellia ingens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and hardiness in temperate climates."
