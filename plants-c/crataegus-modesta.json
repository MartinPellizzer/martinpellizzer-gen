    "intro": "Crataegus modesta, commonly known as the Chinese hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Crataegus modesta is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in ecological systems, providing food for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
