    "intro": "Coccothrinax pseudorigida, commonly known as the rigid palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola. The plant is characterized by its robust, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of pale, waxy hair. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, three-angled fruits. This palm is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils."
