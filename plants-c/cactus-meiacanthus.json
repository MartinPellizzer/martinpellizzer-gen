    "intro": "Cactus meiacanthus, commonly known as the yellow-tipped cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the surface after rare rains. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The flowers are pollinated by nocturnal insects, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat."
