    "intro": "Cinchona ovata, commonly known as the oval tree or the white cinchona, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon basin. The plant is characterized by its large, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. It produces red, fleshy berries that contain seeds. Cinchona ovata is notable for its potential medicinal properties, though it is less commonly used than other cinchona species for quinine production."
