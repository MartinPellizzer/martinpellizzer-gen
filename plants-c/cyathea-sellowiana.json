    "intro": "Cyathea sellowiana, commonly known as the Sellow's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant is evergreen and can grow up to several meters in height, with a slow growth rate. Its rhizomes produce roots that anchor it to the substrate, while its fronds are used for photosynthesis. Cyathea sellowiana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
