    "intro": "Castanopsis sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved tanyip, is a species of evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage, which is typical of sclerophyllous plants adapted to dry or nutrient-poor conditions. The tree produces small, clustered flowers followed by hard, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stressors. Castanopsis sclerophylla plays an important ecological role in tropical and subtropical forests, contributing to soil stability and habitat diversity."
