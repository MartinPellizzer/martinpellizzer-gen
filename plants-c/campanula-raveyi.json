    "intro": "Campanula raveyi, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in rocky or gravelly areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
