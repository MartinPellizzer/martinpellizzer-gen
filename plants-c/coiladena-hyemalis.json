It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
