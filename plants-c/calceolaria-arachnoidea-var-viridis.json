    "intro": "Calceolaria arachnoidea var. viridis, commonly known as the green spider orchid, is a striking member of the Campanulaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in high-altitude cloud forests. The plant is characterized by its unique, spider-like flowers that are typically green or greenish-yellow in color, which is a distinguishing feature of the varietal form. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized gardens due to its specific growing requirements."
