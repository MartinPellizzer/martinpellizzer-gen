    "intro": "Claytonia interrupta, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as meadows and forest understories. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Claytonia interrupta is also known for its ability to produce a unique, spicy scent when the leaves are crushed."
