    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 arthuriana, commonly known as the Arthuriana orchid, is a hybrid orchid species originating from crosses between Cattleya labiata and Cattleya mossiae. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a vibrant pink or lavender hue with contrasting white or yellow markings. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil, and thrives in warm, humid environments. Its inflorescence usually consists of 3 to 5 flowers, each with a prominent lip that is often a different color from the rest of the bloom. This orchid is prized for its ornamental value and is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and fragrance."
