    "intro": "Cabomba schwartzii, commonly known as the swamp waterweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to South America. It features finely divided, feather-like leaves that are typically bright green and arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, white, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or just at the water's surface. It thrives in still to slow-moving freshwater environments with soft, muddy substrates. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in ponds and water gardens."
