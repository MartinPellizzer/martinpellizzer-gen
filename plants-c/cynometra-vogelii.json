    "intro": "Cynometra vogelii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sterculiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The tree produces small, white flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, dark brown seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making, and for its potential medicinal properties. Cynometra vogelii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks."
