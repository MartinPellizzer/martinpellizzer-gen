    "intro": "Cynanchum dentatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the northwestern United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the genus Cynanchum. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a notable botanical feature, and it contains alkaloids that have been studied for potential medicinal properties. Cynanchum dentatum is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
