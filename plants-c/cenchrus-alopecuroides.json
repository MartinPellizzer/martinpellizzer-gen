    "intro": "Cenchrus alopecuroides, commonly known as sandbur, is a perennial grass native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its spiny, burr-like seeds that attach to animals and clothing, aiding in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
