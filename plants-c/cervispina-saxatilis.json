    "intro": "Cervispina saxatilis, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. It is often found in crevices and on rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed habitats."
