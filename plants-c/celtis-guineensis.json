    "intro": "Celtis guineensis, commonly known as the African hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring smooth, grey bark and simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, yellowish fruits that are edible for some animals but generally not palatable to humans. Celtis guineensis is valued for its hard wood and is often used in local construction and furniture making."
