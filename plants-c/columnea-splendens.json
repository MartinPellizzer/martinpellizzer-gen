    "intro": "Columnea splendens, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vivid, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to trees in its natural habitat, and produces showy, spurred flowers that attract hummingbirds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a fine, silky pubescence. Columnea splendens is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded gardens."
