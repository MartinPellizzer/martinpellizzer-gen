    "intro": "Carex tricholepis, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are often hairy, especially along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typical of sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Carex tricholepis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
