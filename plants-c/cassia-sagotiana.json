    "intro": "Cassia sagotiana, commonly known as the Philippine cassia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces bright yellow inflorescences, which are clusters of small, pea-like flowers. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Cassia sagotiana is often found in open woodland and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
