It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in clusters at the base of the stems. Cyperus ciliolatus thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
