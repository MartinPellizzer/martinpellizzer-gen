    "intro": "Cloiselia humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. Native to specific regions in southern Africa, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its growth habit is generally low and spreading, making it suitable for ground cover in suitable climates. Due to its limited distribution, Cloiselia humbertii is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
