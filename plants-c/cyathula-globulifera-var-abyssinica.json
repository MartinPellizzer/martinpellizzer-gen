It is characterized by its distinctive, bladder-like fruits that contain a single seed. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential medicinal properties."
