    "intro": "Conyza coronipifolia, commonly known as the common ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is an annual herb that grows up to 1 meter tall, characterized by its erect stem and hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its roots are fibrous and can become invasive in certain environments. Conyza coronipifolia is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
