    "intro": "Croton abutilifolius, commonly known as the woolly croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hair. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red, followed by woody, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions for its unique foliage and resilience."
