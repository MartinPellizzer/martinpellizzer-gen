    "intro": "Colema arenaria, commonly known as sand colema, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Colema arenaria is often found in dune habitats and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
