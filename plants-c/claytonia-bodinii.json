    "intro": "Claytonia bodinii, commonly known as the \"Sierra glacier violet,\" is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a small perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, alpine habitats, often in areas with limited soil. The plant produces delicate, violet-colored flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Claytonia bodinii is adapted to cold climates and is considered a rare and specialized species due to its restricted geographic range."
