    "intro": "Cyrtomium micropterum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish-black rhizomes. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its foliage is typically dark green and glossy, with a distinctive, almost metallic sheen. Cyrtomium micropterum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
