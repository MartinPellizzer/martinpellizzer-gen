    "intro": "Cycas desolata, commonly known as the desert cycad, is a species of cycad native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones instead of flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Cycas desolata is adapted to arid environments and can survive in poor soil conditions. It is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage and limited genetic diversity."
