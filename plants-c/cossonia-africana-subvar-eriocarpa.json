    "intro": "Cossonia africana subvar. eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly cossonia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stem and dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a rough texture, while the subvariety eriocarpa is distinguished by its thick, woolly covering. This plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
