It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical purple or yellow hues of the species. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It typically blooms in late autumn or early winter, making it a notable addition to winter gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its elegant, cup-shaped flowers and its ability to add color during the colder months."
