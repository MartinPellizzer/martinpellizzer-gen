    "intro": "Cumulopuntia iturbicola, commonly known as the iturbicola cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in dense clusters of spines. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Cumulopuntia iturbicola is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
