    "intro": "Carex digitalis var. assymetrica, commonly known as the asymmetric sedge, is a perennial plant native to moist, temperate regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a distinctive, asymmetrical pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Carex genus. It thrives in wet or semi-aquatic environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing soil in wetland areas."
