    "intro": "Climacoptera ustjurtensis, commonly known as the Ustjurt climacoptera, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, featuring small, narrow leaves to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
