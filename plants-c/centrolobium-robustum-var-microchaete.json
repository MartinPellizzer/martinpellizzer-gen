    "intro": "Centrolobium robustum var. microchaete, commonly known as the Brazilian pequi tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnately arranged, with small, glandular stipules. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, often with a reddish or brownish hue. The species is valued for its timber, which is durable and used in construction, as well as for its seeds, which are a traditional food source in some regions."
