    "intro": "Conyza viscidula, commonly known as sticky weed or sand mat, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Conyza viscidula is considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
