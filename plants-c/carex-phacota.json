    "intro": "Carex phacota, commonly known as narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. Native to moist environments such as wetlands and streambanks, it thrives in areas with consistent moisture. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, three-rowed berries. Carex phacota is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
