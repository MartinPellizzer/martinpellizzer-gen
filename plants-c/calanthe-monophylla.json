    "intro": "Calanthe monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its solitary, leathery leaf and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown. Calanthe monophylla is highly valued in horticulture for its beauty and rarity, though it is difficult to cultivate outside its natural habitat."
