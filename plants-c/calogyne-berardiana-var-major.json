    "intro": "Calogyne berardiana var. major, commonly known as the giant calogyne, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
