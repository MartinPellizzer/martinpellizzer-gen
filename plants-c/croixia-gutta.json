    "intro": "Croixia gutta, commonly known as the spotted bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps in deterring herbivores. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in sunny, well-drained habitats. Croixia gutta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens."
