    "intro": "Cousinia farimanensis, commonly known as Fariman's cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Iran. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair. Cousinia farimanensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited geographic distribution."
