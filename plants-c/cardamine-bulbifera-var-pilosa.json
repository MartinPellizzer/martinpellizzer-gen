    "intro": "Cardamine bulbifera var. pilosa, commonly known as hairy watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a single terminal umbel, which bloom in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, while its bulbs serve as storage organs for nutrients. This variety is distinguished by its hairy foliage, which helps distinguish it from other Cardamine species."
