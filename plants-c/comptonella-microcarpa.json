    "intro": "Comptonella microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited comptonella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it typically grows in rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant is characterized by its compact shrub form, with small, elliptical leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Comptonella microcarpa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
