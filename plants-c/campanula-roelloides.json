    "intro": "Campanula roelloides, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for alpine gardens. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. Campanula roelloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant."
