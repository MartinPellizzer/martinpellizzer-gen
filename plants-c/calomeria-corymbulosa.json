    "intro": "Calomeria corymbulosa, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a robust taproot system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, hairy seed capsules. Its leaves are lance-shaped, gray-green in color, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Calomeria corymbulosa is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
