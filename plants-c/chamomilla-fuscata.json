    "intro": "Chamomilla fuscata, commonly known as the rough chamomile, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and yellow-orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its flowers bloom in the summer, producing small, composite flower heads that attract pollinators. While not as widely used in herbal medicine as other chamomile species, it has some traditional uses in folk remedies."
