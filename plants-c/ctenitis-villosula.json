    "intro": "Ctenitis villosula, commonly known as the hairy ctenitis, is a species of marine algae belonging to the family Halymeda. It is characterized by its branching, calcified thallus that resembles a coral-like structure. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its filamentous, ribbon-like branches covered in a fine, velvety layer of hair. It thrives in shallow, warm coastal waters where it plays a role in reef ecosystems. Ctenitis villosula is often found in association with other calcifying algae and contributes to the structural complexity of marine habitats."
