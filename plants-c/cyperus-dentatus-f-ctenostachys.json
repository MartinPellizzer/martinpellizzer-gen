    "intro": "Cyperus dentatus f. ctenostachys, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. Its flowers are small and clustered, with three stamens and a three-lobed pistil. This variety is distinguished by its finely toothed leaf margins and a more elongated inflorescence compared to the typical form of Cyperus dentatus."
