    "intro": "Crepinia detracta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waterwheel, is a perennial aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters at the water's surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Crepinia detracta plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and small fish."
