    "intro": "Corymbia semiclara, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery or greyish underside, contributing to its common name. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. The tree is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for reforestation and ornamental planting."
