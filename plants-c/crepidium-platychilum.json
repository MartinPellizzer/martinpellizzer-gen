It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and linear, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
