    "intro": "Cynodon ciliaris, commonly known as the coastal grass or seaside grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. Cynodon ciliaris is also valued as a forage plant for livestock in arid and semi-arid environments."
