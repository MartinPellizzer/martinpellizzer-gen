    "intro": "Campanula breynina, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine downy layer, which helps to retain moisture in harsh environments. Campanula breynina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens for its hardiness and beauty."
