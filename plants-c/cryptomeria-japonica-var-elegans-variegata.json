    "intro": "Cryptomeria japonica var. elegans-variegata, commonly known as the Japanese cedar variegated form, is a cultivar of the Japanese cedar tree. It is characterized by its unique foliage, which features a striking variegation of white, yellow, and green on the needles. This variegation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in reduced photosynthetic efficiency. The plant is evergreen and can grow into a tall tree, though it is often cultivated as a smaller ornamental shrub. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
