    "intro": "Centaurea albiflora, commonly known as the white centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open fields and along coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while its flowers are surrounded by pale blue bracts. Centaurea albiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
