    "intro": "Caralluma moorei, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India and Africa. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its spiny, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the rainy season, adding a touch of beauty to its otherwise rugged appearance. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, further adapting it to minimize water loss. Caralluma moorei is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, including its potential diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
