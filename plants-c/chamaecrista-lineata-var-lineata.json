    "intro": "Chamaecrista lineata var. lineata, commonly known as the narrowleaf burr legume, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by long, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and potential medicinal research."
