    "intro": "Cactus ovatus, commonly known as the globe cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical shape and spiny, segmented stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Cactus ovatus is well adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal water and high sunlight exposure."
