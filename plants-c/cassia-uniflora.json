    "intro": "Cassia uniflora, commonly known as the sicklepod, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces distinctive, sickle-shaped pods that contain several seeds. Cassia uniflora is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a notable weed in agricultural settings."
