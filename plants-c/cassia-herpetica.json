It is characterized by its zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves that are often fragrant. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom during the dry season. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods and are used in traditional medicine. Cassia herpetica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
