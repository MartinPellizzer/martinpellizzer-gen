    "intro": "Calonemorchis williamsiae, commonly known as the Williams' calonemorchis, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a short, stocky rhizome and produces a single, erect stem bearing a few flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
