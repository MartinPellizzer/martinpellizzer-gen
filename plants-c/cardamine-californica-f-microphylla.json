It is a perennial herb characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest understories. Its foliage is often densely packed, forming a low, mat-like growth habit. Botanically, it is distinguished by its reduced leaf size compared to the typical form of Cardamine californica."
