    "intro": "Claytonia bonplandiana, commonly known as the pink rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, basal leaves and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, arid environment. Claytonia bonplandiana is also known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
