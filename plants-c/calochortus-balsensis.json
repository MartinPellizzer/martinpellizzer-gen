    "intro": "Calochortus balsensis, commonly known as the Balsamroot Mariposa Lily, is a striking perennial wildflower native to the western United States. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive purple throat. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Calochortus balsensis is often found in open grasslands and along rocky slopes, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
