It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
