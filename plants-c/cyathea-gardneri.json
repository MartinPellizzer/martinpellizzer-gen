    "intro": "Cyathea gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a distinctive crown of fronds that can reach several meters in height, contributing to its ornamental value. Cyathea gardneri thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, a key feature of its reproductive biology."
