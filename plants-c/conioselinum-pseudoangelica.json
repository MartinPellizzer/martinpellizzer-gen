    "intro": "Conioselinum pseudoangelica, commonly known as angelica weed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its aromatic compounds. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, and its leaves are finely divided with a strong, pungent odor. The species is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth habit."
