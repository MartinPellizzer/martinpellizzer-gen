    "intro": "Carex neglecta var. major, commonly known as the giant swamp sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variant is notable for its larger size compared to other Carex species, making it a distinctive feature in wetland ecosystems."
