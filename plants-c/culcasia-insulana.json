    "intro": "Culcasia insulana, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are typically a deep green color and have a waxy surface that helps repel water. Culcasia insulana is often used in water gardens and as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance."
