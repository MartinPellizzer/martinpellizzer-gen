It is a perennial shrub characterized by its erect, branching stems and spiny leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variant is adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
