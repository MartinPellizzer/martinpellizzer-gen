    "intro": "Cogswellia leptophylla, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique species of flowering plant native to the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its striking, translucent, waxy leaves that appear almost ghostly in appearance, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Cogswellia leptophylla is considered a vulnerable species and is of significant botanical interest."
