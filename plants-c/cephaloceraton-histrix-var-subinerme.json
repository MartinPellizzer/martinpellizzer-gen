    "intro": "Cephaloceraton histrix var. subinerme, commonly known as the smooth-fruited horned cup, is a rare and distinctive plant belonging to the family Cephalocerataceae. It is characterized by its unique, horn-like structures on its stems and leaves, which are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by elongated, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
