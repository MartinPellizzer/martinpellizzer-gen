    "intro": "Cyrtomium haitiense, commonly known as Haitian water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the island of Hispaniola. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, compact growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Cyrtomium haitiense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
