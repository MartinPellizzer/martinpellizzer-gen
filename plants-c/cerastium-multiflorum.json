    "intro": "Cerastium multiflorum, commonly known as the mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its many small flowers, and it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature."
