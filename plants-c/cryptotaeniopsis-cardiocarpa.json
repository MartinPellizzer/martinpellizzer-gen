    "intro": "Cryptotaeniopsis cardiocarpa, commonly known as the heart-shaped fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant's unique heart-shaped spore-bearing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
