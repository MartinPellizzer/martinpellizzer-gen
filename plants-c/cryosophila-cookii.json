    "intro": "Cryosophila cookii, commonly known as the Cook's cryosophila, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is adapted to extreme cold and high UV radiation, showcasing specialized morphological features such as dense, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale blue, typically blooming during the short summer months. Its growth is limited to specific microhabitats, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Cryosophila cookii is considered a vulnerable species."
