It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
