    "intro": "Cousinia rosea, commonly known as the pink stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its compact, succulent-like foliage and showy, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Cousinia rosea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a drought-tolerant landscape plant."
