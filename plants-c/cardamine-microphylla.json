    "intro": "Cardamine microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved water crowfoot, is a delicate aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and damp meadows. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with a distinctive arrangement of veins. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, consisting of two sepals and two petals, and it produces small, bead-like fruits. Cardamine microphylla plays a role in supporting aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
