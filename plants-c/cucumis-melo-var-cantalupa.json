It is characterized by its rough, green rind with a distinctive warty texture and a sweet, fragrant, pale yellow to orange flesh. The plant produces yellow flowers and has a sprawling growth habit, often requiring support for its vines.

The fruit is prized for its flavor and is commonly used in both fresh consumption and culinary applications."
