    "intro": "Castilleja rhexiifolia var. pubens, commonly known as the pubescent prairie smoke, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features showy, pink to red bract-like flowers that resemble smoke, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving it a distinctive texture. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as prairies and sandy soils."
