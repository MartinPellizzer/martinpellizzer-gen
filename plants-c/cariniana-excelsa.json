    "intro": "Cariniana excelsa, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tall, evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and produces elongated, woody pods containing seeds known as Brazil nuts. The tree has a complex root system and can grow up to 50 meters in height, making it a significant component of the rainforest canopy. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically pollinated by specific insects. The fruit takes about 6 to 8 months to mature, and the tree can live for over 100 years."
