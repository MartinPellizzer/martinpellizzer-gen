    "intro": "Chaetogastra minor, commonly known as the small hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may be partially exposed. Chaetogastra minor is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the absorption of nutrients from captured prey."
