    "intro": "Callitris columellaris, commonly known as the coastal cabbage tree, is a species of coniferous tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown, which provides it with a distinctive appearance. The tree has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, reducing water loss in arid environments. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This plant is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions."
