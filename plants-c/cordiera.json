It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. These plants are typically found in acidic, well-drained soils and thrive in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Cordiera species are native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to form compact, evergreen shrubs."
