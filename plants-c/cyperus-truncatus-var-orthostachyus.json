It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, three-ranked flowers, which are often wind-pollinated.
