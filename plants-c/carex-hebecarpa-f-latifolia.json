    "intro": "Carex hebecarpa f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are broader than the typical form of the species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
