    "intro": "Cousinia lamprophyllaria, commonly known as the silverleaf cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers in late summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Cousinia lamprophyllaria is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
