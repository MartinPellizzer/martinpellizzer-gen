    "intro": "Cyathostelma furcatum, commonly known as the forked cup plant, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is a unique feature of the genus Cyathostelma. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
