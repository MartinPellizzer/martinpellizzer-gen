    "intro": "Caladenia infundibularis, commonly known as the red-tongued spider orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy flower with a distinctive red lip that resembles a spider's tongue. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats, often in regions with a Mediterranean climate. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly wasps, due to their mimicry of female wasps. This species is listed as vulnerable in some regions due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
