    "intro": "Cardamine heishuiensis, commonly known as the Heishui watercress, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is native to China, specifically found in the mountainous regions of Sichuan province. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along streams and in rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
