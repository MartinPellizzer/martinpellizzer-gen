    "intro": "Celmisia membranacea, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silver-white, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its native habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments like forest floors and rocky areas. Celmisia membranacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
