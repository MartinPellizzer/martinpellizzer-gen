    "intro": "Carex bigelowii subsp. rigida, commonly known as rigid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments."
