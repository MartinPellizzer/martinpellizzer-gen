    "intro": "Cotula viscosa, commonly known as common groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Cotula viscosa is known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a weed and a valuable plant in ecological studies."
