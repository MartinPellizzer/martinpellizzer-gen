    "intro": "Colletia ferox var. infausta, commonly known as the death cactus, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne in clusters at the base of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Due to its toxic sap and sharp spines, it is considered a potentially dangerous plant to handle."
