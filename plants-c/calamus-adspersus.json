It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, slender rhizomes and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking inflorescences consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands and marshy areas. Calamus adspersus is valued for its aromatic rhizomes, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
