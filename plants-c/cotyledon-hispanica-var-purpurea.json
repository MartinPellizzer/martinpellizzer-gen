It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically purple or reddish in color, with a waxy texture that helps it store water. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding visual interest to its appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique coloration and compact growth habit make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
