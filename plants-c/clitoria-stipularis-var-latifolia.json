    "intro": "Clitoria stipularis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved winged bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with broad, heart-shaped leaflets and distinctive butterfly-like purple flowers. The plant produces pods that contain edible seeds, which are rich in protein and nutrients. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often grown for both ornamental and agricultural purposes. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it a valuable cover crop in sustainable farming systems."
