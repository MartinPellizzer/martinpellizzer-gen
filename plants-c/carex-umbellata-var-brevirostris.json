    "intro": "Carex umbellata var. brevirostris, commonly known as the narrow-beak sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and three-ranked leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in moist environments. The narrow, pointed bracts of the inflorescence give it its specific epithet, \"brevirostris,\" meaning \"short beak.\""
