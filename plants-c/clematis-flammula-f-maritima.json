    "intro": "Clematis flammula f. maritima, commonly known as the sea clematis, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a trailing or climbing vine characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant thrives in sandy or calcareous soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its foliage is typically grayish-green, with finely toothed leaves that help reduce water loss in salty air. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
