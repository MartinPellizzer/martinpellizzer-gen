    "intro": "Centaurea sciaphila, commonly known as the shade-loving centaurea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Centaurea sciaphila is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial to full shade."
