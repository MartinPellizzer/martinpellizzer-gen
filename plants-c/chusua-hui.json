    "intro": "Chusua hui, commonly known as the Chinese hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for ornamental landscaping. Chusua hui is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators and its role in ecological restoration projects."
