    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe elegans, commonly known as the elegant crocodile fern, is a rare epiphytic fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often twisted fronds that resemble the scales of a crocodile, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of moss-like growth, which aids in water retention. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range."
