It belongs to the family Alismataceae and is characterized by its delicate, branching structure and feather-like leaves. The plant thrives in brackish and saltwater environments, often growing in tidal zones and estuaries. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Ceraia lamellulifera plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
