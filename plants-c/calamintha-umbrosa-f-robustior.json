    "intro": "Calamintha umbrosa f. robustior, commonly known as the robust cushion mint, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its aromatic leaves and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
