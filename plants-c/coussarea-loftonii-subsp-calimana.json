    "intro": "Coussarea loftonii subsp. calimana, commonly known as the Calimana corymbia, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree, characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces red or orange berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in montane forests, and is adapted to high humidity and well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
