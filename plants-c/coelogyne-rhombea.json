    "intro": "Coelogyne rhombea, commonly known as the rhombic orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped pseudobulbs and long, arching inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces showy, long-lasting blooms that attract pollinators. Coelogyne rhombea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its vibrant floral display."
