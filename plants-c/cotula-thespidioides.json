    "intro": "Cotula thespidioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved groundsel, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny environments such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cotula thespidioides is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or inland regions with a Mediterranean climate."
