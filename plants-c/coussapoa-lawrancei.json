    "intro": "Coussapoa lawrancei, commonly known as the Lawrence's cupua\u00e7u, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to cupua\u00e7u but are less commonly consumed. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
