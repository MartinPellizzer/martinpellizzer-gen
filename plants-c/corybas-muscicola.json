    "intro": "Corybas muscicola, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique member of the orchid family native to New Zealand. It is a terrestrial herb with a distinctive, fleshy, and often reddish-brown pseudobulb. The plant produces a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a specialized structure called a labellum, which is adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in forest floors or rocky areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
