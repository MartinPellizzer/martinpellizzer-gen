    "intro": "Coelogyne longiana, commonly known as the long-leaf orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescence and vibrant, fragrant flowers that range from yellow to orange-red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and serve as storage organs for water and nutrients. Coelogyne longiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its striking floral display."
