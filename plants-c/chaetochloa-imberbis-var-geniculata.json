    "intro": "Chaetochloa imberbis var. geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag or twisted growth pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it forms dense, mat-like colonies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous structure that aids in water retention. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered and can vary in color depending on the season."
