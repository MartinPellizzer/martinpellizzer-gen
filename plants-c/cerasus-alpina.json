    "intro": "Cerasus alpina, commonly known as the alpine cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves and showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red, tart cherries that are edible but often used for making jams and syrups. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
