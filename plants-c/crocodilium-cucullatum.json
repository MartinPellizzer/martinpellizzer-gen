It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique, shield-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with a prominent central vein and small, rounded lobes. Crocodilium cucullatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
