    "intro": "Cyclopogon torusus, commonly known as the Torus mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Cyclopogon torusus is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and coastal areas."
