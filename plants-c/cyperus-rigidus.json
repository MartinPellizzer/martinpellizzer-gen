    "intro": "Cyperus rigidus, commonly known as rigid flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a prominent midrib, and it can form dense stands in suitable habitats. Cyperus rigidus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
