It features showy orange-red tubular flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has glossy, dark green foliage that provides ornamental value throughout the growing season. It is more shrub-like than its taller relatives, making it suitable for smaller gardens or as a container plant. This cultivar is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
