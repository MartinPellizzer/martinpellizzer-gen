    "intro": "Commicarpus squarrosus var. fruticosus, commonly known as the hairy devil's backbone, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in dense, white, cottony hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by capsule fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions with a Mediterranean climate. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
