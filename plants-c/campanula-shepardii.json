    "intro": "Campanula shepardii, commonly known as the Sheppard's bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or sagebrush habitats. Campanula shepardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
