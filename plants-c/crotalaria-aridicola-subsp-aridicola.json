    "intro": "Crotalaria aridicola subsp. aridicola, commonly known as the desert crownflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish to greenish flowers. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a hairy surface, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces capsules that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to drought conditions."
