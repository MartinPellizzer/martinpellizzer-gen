    "intro": "Coppensia alvarenguensis, commonly known as the Alvar\u00e9ngues' coppen, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Portugal. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and coastal winds. Its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations make it a subject of interest for botanists studying coastal flora. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Coppensia alvarenguensis is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
