    "intro": "Castilleja unalaschcensis subsp. transnivalis, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright red to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. It typically grows in alpine tundra and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cold, dry conditions. Its unique ecological role supports pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its mountainous environment."
