It is characterized by its striking purple to pink flower heads, which are composed of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. It has a sprawling growth habit with branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The species is also noted for its ability to self-seed readily, contributing to its widespread distribution."
