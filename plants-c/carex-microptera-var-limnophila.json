    "intro": "Carex microptera var. limnophila, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 mm wide, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to aquatic conditions, often found in ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. Due to its preference for wet habitats, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
