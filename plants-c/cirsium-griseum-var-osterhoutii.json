    "intro": "Cirsium griseum var. osterhoutii, commonly known as the Osterhout's thistle, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
