It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
