    "intro": "Carex chrysolepis var. glabrior, commonly known as the smoothleaf tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is often found in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and marshes. The plant typically grows in clumps, with slender, cylindrical stems that are covered in short, smooth leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike of small, three-ranked spikelets, which are often tinged with green or brown. This variety is distinguished by its smoother leaf surface compared to the typical form of Carex chrysolepis."
