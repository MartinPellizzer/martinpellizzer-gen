    "intro": "Calophyllum recedens, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species. Calophyllum recedens is well adapted to saline environments, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems."
