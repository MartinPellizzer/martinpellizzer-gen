    "intro": "Cynanchum album, commonly known as white swallowwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by follicles containing seeds with silky hairs. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
