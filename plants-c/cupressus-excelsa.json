    "intro": "Cupressus excelsa, commonly known as the Himalayan cedar, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and dense, dark-green foliage. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. Cupressus excelsa is valued for its durable wood and is often used in construction and furniture-making."
