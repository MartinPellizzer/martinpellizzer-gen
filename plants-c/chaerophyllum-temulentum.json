    "intro": "Chaerophyllum temulentum, commonly known as the fool's parsley or wild chervil, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves and seeds have been used historically in folk medicine, though caution is advised due to its potential toxicity."
