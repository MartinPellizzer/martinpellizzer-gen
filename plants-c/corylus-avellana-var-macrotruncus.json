    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. macrotruncus, commonly known as the large-truncated hazelnut, is a variant of the common hazelnut native to Europe. It is characterized by its broad, truncate-shaped nuts and hairy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are male and female flowers on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible nuts, though it is less commonly cultivated than other hazelnut species."
