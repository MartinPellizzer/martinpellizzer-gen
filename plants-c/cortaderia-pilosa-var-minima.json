    "intro": "Cortaderia pilosa var. minima, commonly known as the miniature feather reed grass, is a compact variant of the feather reed grass species. It is native to South America and is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that forms dense, upright clumps. The plant produces slender, feathery plumes in the autumn, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Due to its compact size, it is ideal for small garden spaces or as a border plant."
