    "intro": "Cymopterus bipinnatus, commonly known as the twin-leaf lomatium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb native to the western United States, typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in umbrella-shaped clusters, and the plant produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Cymopterus bipinnatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use by indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes."
