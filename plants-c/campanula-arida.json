    "intro": "Campanula arida, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It features upright, slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue, purple, or white. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Campanula arida is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging climates."
