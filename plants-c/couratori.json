    "intro": "Couratori, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and yellow composite flowers that resemble dandelions. Couratori species often have a milky sap and are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Their ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as host plants for certain insect species."
