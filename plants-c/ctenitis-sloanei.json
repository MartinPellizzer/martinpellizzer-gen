    "intro": "Ctenitis sloanei, commonly known as the Sloane's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome system supports the development of its tall stem, while its fronds are used for photosynthesis. Ctenitis sloanei plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
