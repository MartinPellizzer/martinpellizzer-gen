It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and small, red berries that are produced in the fall. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
