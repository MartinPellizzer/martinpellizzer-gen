    "intro": "Crepidomanes cystoseiroides, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. These plants typically grow in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The leaves are often reduced or modified into tendrils, while the flowers are usually small and inconspicuous. The genus is known for its unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition through carnivory."
