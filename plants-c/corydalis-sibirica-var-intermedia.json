    "intro": "Corydalis sibirica var. intermedia, commonly known as the Siberian Corydalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, branching stems that often grow from the base, with lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces clusters of delicate, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine for their purported analgesic properties. Corydalis sibirica var. intermedia thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and woodland settings."
