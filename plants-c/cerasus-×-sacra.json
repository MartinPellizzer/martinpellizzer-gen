    "intro": "Cerasus \u00d7 sacra, commonly known as the cherry plum, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Prunus avium (sweet cherry) and Prunus domestica (European plum). It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible drupes that range in color from yellow to dark red. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive blossoms and fruit. The cherry plum is adapted to temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil."
