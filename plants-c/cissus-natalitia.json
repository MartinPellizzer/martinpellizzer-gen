    "intro": "Cissus natalitia, commonly known as Natal fig-leaf, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are highly valued in local cuisine. Its stems are flexible and can trail along the ground or climb supports, making it suitable for vertical gardening. Cissus natalitia is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to partial shade."
