It is a climbing vine that produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in umbels. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Celastrus rigidus is typically found in woodland areas and thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
