    "intro": "Cerastium glabrum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along paths. Cerastium glabrum is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through runners, making it both a common weed and a resilient ground cover."
