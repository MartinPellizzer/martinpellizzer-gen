    "intro": "Camphorosma annua, commonly known as annual camphorosma, is an annual herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in small, capsule-like fruits that split open to disperse the seeds. Camphorosma annua is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
