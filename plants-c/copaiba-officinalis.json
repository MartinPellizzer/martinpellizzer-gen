    "intro": "Copaiba officinalis, commonly known as copaiba, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, aromatic bark and produces a valuable resin known as copaiba balsam. The plant belongs to the family Burseraceae and is known for its ability to exude a yellowish resin when its bark is wounded. The resin has been traditionally used for its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antiseptic effects. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and pharmacological contexts."
