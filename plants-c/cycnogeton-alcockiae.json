    "intro": "Cycnogeton alcockiae, commonly known as the alcock's cycnogeton, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It is often found in coastal and lowland areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
