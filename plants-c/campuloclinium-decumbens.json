    "intro": "Campuloclinium decumbens, commonly known as creeping cowpea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in moist, sandy soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
