    "intro": "Cyrtochilum guariniae, commonly known as the Guarinia orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces a single, slender inflorescence with several flowers. Cyrtochilum guariniae is a rare and specialized species, often found in cloud forests, where it relies on specific ecological conditions for survival."
