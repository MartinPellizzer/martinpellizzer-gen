    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris leptoloba, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white flowers with five petals and produces tiny, bladder-like seed pods that burst to disperse seeds. The plant has alternate, oval-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and a fibrous root system. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a common weed in many regions."
