    "intro": "Campylocercum, commonly known as the ghost flower or ghost plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique, spiraling inflorescence that resembles a ghostly or ethereal shape, hence its common name. The plants typically have palmate leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense, spiral arrangements. Campylocercum species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
