    "intro": "Cupressus australis, commonly known as the Australian lacebark or Australian white cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and its distinctive, peeling bark that reveals a pale, fibrous inner layer. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by oval, woody cones. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subcoastal regions. Cupressus australis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for native wildlife."
