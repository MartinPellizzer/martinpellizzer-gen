    "intro": "Camaridium nutantiflorum, commonly known as the wavy-flowered camaridium, is a unique member of the Camaridaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, wavy-edged leaves that exhibit a vibrant green color with a subtle variegation. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of pink and white. Its growth habit is semi-woody, with a tendency to trail or cascade, making it suitable for hanging baskets or as a ground cover. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in warm, humid environments with well-drained soil."
