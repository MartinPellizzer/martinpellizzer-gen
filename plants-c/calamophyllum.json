    "intro": "Calamophyllum, commonly known as the desert sage, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. The plants are shrubs with silver-gray foliage and produce small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Calamophyllum species are adapted to harsh, dry environments and have deep root systems to access water. They are often used in landscaping for their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
