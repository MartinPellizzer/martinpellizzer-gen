    "intro": "Carex seorsa, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a triangular cross-section, a characteristic feature of many sedges. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are usually borne on slender, branched stems. Carex seorsa plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
