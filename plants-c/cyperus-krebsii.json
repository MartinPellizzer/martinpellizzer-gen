    "intro": "Cyperus krebsii, commonly known as the swamp cyperus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and shallow water areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Cyperus krebsii produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the ends of its flowering stems. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
