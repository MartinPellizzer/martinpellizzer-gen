    "intro": "Croton inversus, commonly known as the Upside-down Caper, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves that resemble the shape of a caper, with the leaflets arranged in an upward-facing pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange or red berries. Its roots and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Croton inversus thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
