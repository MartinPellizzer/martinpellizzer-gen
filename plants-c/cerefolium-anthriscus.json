    "intro": "Cerefolium anthriscus, commonly known as lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of smooth, waxy, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically bright yellow to green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Cerefolium anthriscus is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native plants."
