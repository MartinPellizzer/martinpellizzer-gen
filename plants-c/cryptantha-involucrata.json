    "intro": "Cryptantha involucrata, commonly known as the woolly bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, showy flowers and pungent aroma. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. The fruit is a cylindrical silique that contains several seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
