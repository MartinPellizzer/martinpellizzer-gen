    "intro": "Crataegus praecox, commonly known as the early hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches, oval leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus praecox is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
