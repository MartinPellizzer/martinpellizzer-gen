    "intro": "Campanula versicolor var. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, grayish foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often varying within the same inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
