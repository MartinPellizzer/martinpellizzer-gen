    "intro": "Claytonia minima, commonly known as the fairy slipper or dwarf spring beauty, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, nodding flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, slipper-shaped lower petal. The plant has a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in its woodland or rocky habitat. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Claytonia minima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its charming, early spring blooms."
