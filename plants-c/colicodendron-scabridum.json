    "intro": "Colicodendron scabridum, commonly known as the roughleaf colicodendron, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rough, textured foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory species in humid, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, which contribute to its common name. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds when mature."
