    "intro": "Centaurea phrygia subsp. rarauensis, commonly known as the rare Caucasian centaury, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is noted for its limited distribution and is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
