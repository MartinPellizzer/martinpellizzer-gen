    "intro": "Cliffortia stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky and sandy soils, often found on coastal cliffs and slopes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
