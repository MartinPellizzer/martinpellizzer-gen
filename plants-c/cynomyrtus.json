    "intro": "Cynomyrtus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their aromatic leaves and small, often showy flowers. The wood of Cynomyrtus species is highly valued for its density and rich reddish color, making it a prized material in traditional crafts and furniture. The genus includes several species, such as Cynomyrtus hexandra, which is known for its ornamental value and ecological significance. Due to overharvesting, many species within this genus are now considered threatened or endangered."
