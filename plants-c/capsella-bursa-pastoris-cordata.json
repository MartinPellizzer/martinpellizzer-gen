    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, oval, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, bladder-like structure called a silique, which aids in seed dispersal. This species is often found in disturbed soils, gardens, and along roadsides, where it thrives in moist, temperate conditions."
