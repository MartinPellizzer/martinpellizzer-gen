    "intro": "Cassia foetidissima, commonly known as stinkwood or African blackwood, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with a dense, dark bark that gives it its common name. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the late spring and summer months. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like leaflets, and the plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor. Cassia foetidissima is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in traditional crafts and musical instruments."
