    "intro": "Cyphostemma gigantophyllum, commonly known as the giant devil's backbone, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, succulent stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cyphostemma gigantophyllum is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine."
