    "intro": "Corispermum hyssopifolium var. pachypterum, commonly known as the thick-winged bladderwort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called pneumatocysts, which aid in buoyancy and gas exchange. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it thrives in high-salinity soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variant is part of the family Brassicaceae and exhibits specialized adaptations for survival in extreme conditions."
