    "intro": "Calopyxis bernieriana, commonly known as the Bernier's calopyxis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calopyxis bernieriana is considered a species of conservation concern."
