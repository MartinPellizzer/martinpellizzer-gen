    "intro": "Crocus sativus var. haussknechtii, commonly known as the Haussknechtii saffron crocus, is a variant of the saffron crocus native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, triangular-shaped leaves and has a compact growth habit. Its flowers are notable for their ability to produce saffron threads, similar to the standard Crocus sativus. This variety is often cultivated for both ornamental purposes and for the harvesting of its stigmas, which are used in culinary and medicinal applications."
