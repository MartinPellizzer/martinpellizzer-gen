    "intro": "Campanula polymorpha f. sciaphila, commonly known as the shade-loving bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments, making it ideal for woodland gardens or shaded rockeries. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize in moist, cool conditions. It is native to parts of Europe and is valued for its ability to bloom reliably in low-light conditions."
