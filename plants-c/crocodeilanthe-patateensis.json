    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe patateensis, commonly known as the potato fern, is a rare and unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds. The plant's fronds are typically lance-shaped and have a leathery texture, with a dark green coloration that often features subtle variegation. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich substrates to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
