    "intro": "Coccothrinax miraguama subsp. arenicola, commonly known as the Caribbean rock palm, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean region. It is characterized by its robust, trunk-like stem and clustered, fan-shaped leaves. This subspecies thrives in coastal and rocky habitats, often growing on limestone or sandy soils. Its resilience to salt spray and wind makes it well adapted to maritime environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible fruits, contributing to its ecological and potential economic value."
