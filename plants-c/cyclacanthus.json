    "intro": "Cyclacanthus, commonly known as the star-shaped nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes plants like tomatoes and peppers. It is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia, characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Cyclacanthus thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both horticulture and ecological research."
