    "intro": "Chilocarpus amboinensis, commonly known as the Amboina ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Indonesia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. It produces small, fragrant flowers followed by woody fruits containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and slow growth rate, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
