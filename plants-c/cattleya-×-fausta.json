It originates from a cross between Cattleya labiata and Cattleya mossiae, resulting in a plant with distinctive pink and white petals. The flowers are typically large, with a ruffled lip that adds to their ornamental appeal. This orchid prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media to thrive. It is a popular choice for both indoor cultivation and floral arrangements due to its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
