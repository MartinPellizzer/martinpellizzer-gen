It features a basal rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically pale green to bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to rose-red during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
