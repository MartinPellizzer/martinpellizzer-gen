    "intro": "Cuatrecasasiella, commonly known as the \"Mexican moonflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its showy, nocturnal blooms. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, opening at night and closing in the morning, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. The plant has small, ovate leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated. Due to its unique blooming habits and limited distribution, Cuatrecasasiella is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
