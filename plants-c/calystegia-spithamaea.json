    "intro": "Calystegia spithamaea, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, blooming in the morning. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in wetlands. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in certain regions."
