    "intro": "Coelogyne pandurichila, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, and its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in many tropical gardens and greenhouses."
