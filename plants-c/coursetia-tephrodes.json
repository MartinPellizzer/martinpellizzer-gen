    "intro": "Coursetia tephrodes, commonly known as the desert shrub or sandbush, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Coursetia tephrodes is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
