    "intro": "Cladium milnei, commonly known as the salt marsh cordgrass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that thrives in brackish or saltwater environments, often found in marshes and tidal flats. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically blade-like and grow in dense tufts, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, and it plays an important role in wetland ecosystems. Cladium milnei is also valued for its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and salinity."
