    "intro": "Corispermum maynense, commonly known as the desert cress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a small annual herb with erect, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It has succulent leaves and stems, allowing it to store water efficiently in harsh environments. Corispermum maynense is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to survive in regions with low rainfall."
