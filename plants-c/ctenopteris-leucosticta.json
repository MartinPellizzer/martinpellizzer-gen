    "intro": "Ctenopteris leucosticta, commonly known as the silver sword fern, is a member of the fern family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a silvery underside. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense mats on the forest floor. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a lush, feathery appearance. Ctenopteris leucosticta thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
