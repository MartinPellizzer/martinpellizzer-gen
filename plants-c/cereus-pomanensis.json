    "intro": "Cereus pomanensis, commonly known as the Pomanensis Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, spiny stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, nocturnal flowers that open only at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. This species is adapted to the arid and coastal environments of its native habitat."
