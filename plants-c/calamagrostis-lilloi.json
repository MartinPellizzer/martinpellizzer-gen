    "intro": "Calamagrostis lilloi, commonly known as the Lillo's reed, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, preferring moist to semi-aquatic environments. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. Calamagrostis lilloi is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
