    "intro": "Chamaesyce orbiculata subsp. nilagirica, commonly known as the Nilagiri sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It features small, orbicular (rounded) leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its humid, mountainous habitat."
