    "intro": "Cerastium semidecandrum subsp. pellucidum, commonly known as the translucent chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, white flowers with five petals and possesses a sprawling habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered with fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This subspecies is distinguished by its translucent, waxy coating on the leaves, which helps reduce water loss in humid conditions."
