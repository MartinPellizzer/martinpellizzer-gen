    "intro": "Cadetia mayrii, commonly known as the Mayrii's bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cadetia mayrii is considered a vulnerable species."
