    "intro": "Cymopterus lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon's evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branching. Cymopterus lemmonii plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly moths and beetles, due to its night-blooming nature."
