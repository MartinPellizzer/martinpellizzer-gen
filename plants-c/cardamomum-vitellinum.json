    "intro": "Cardamomum vitellinum, commonly known as the yellow cardamom, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by aromatic, three-lobed fruits containing aromatic seeds. These seeds are highly valued for their intense flavor and are used in both culinary and medicinal applications. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
