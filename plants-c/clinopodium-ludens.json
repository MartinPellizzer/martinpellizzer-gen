    "intro": "Clinopodium ludens, commonly known as lemon balm, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It features aromatic, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves contain essential oils rich in citral, contributing to its distinctive lemony scent. Clinopodium ludens is widely cultivated for its calming properties and used in traditional medicine and aromatherapy."
