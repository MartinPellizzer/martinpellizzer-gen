    "intro": "Cyperus thunbergii var. trisumbellatus, commonly known as the fragrant flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and distinctive inflorescence, which consists of multiple clusters of small, three-branched spikelets. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in shallow water or moist soil. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a grassy texture, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a decorative plant in humid climates."
