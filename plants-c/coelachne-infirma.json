    "intro": "Coelachne infirma, commonly known as the slender flat sedge, is a flowering plant species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, a common trait among grasses. Coelachne infirma is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic plants in its native habitat."
