    "intro": "Comptonella oreophila, commonly known as the mountain comptonella, is a rare and elusive plant species native to specific high-altitude regions. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, often in areas with high humidity and cool temperatures. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Comptonella oreophila is considered a species of conservation concern."
