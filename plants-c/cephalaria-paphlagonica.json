    "intro": "Cephalaria paphlagonica, commonly known as the Paphlagonian cephalaria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, yellowish to pinkish flowers. The plant produces both ray and disk flowers, typical of the daisy family, and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
