    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. decussata, commonly known as the common hawthorn or white hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and oval-shaped leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs, giving it the species name *decussata*. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red, juicy berries in the autumn. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic conditions. This variety is often used in hedgerows and as a ornamental plant due to its attractive form and seasonal interest."
