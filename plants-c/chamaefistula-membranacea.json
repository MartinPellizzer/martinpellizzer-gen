    "intro": "Chamaefistula membranacea, commonly known as the membranous fistula, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring small, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its flowers are followed by small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Chamaefistula membranacea is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
