    "intro": "Carex dolichostachya var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and specialized inflorescence structures. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a tall, cylindrical spike of small, greenish flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless surfaces, which set it apart from other Carex species."
