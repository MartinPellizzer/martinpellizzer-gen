    "intro": "Carex vesicaria subsp. pulla, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its robust, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. Carex vesicaria subsp. pulla is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and ecological balance."
