    "intro": "Corallorhiza striata f. fulva, commonly known as the yellow coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant produces delicate, lance-shaped leaves and bears showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive striped pattern. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is often found growing on the trunks of trees or in leaf litter. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
