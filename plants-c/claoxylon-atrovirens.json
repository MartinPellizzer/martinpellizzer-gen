    "intro": "Claoxylon atrovirens, commonly known as the black-leaved ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and robust, woody trunk. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval-shaped, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for construction and traditional crafts."
