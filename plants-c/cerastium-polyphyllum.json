    "intro": "Cerastium polyphyllum, commonly known as the many-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are oval to heart-shaped, with a hairy texture, and stems that are often prostrate or ascending. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance. Cerastium polyphyllum is also known for its ability to spread via stolons, forming dense mats that can help prevent soil erosion."
