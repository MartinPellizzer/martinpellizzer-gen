    "intro": "Crepis pallida, commonly known as the pale hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are hairy and alternate, with a distinctive pale coloration, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Crepis pallida is often found in open habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
