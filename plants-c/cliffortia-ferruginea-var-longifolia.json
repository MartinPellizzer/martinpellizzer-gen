    "intro": "Cliffortia ferruginea var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved red-hot poker, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are elongated and covered in a fine layer of rust-colored hairs, giving the plant its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and birds."
