    "intro": "Coleosanthus paniculatus, commonly known as the coastal panicled grass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds. Coleosanthus paniculatus plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
