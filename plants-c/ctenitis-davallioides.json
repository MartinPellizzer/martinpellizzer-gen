    "intro": "Ctenitis davallioides, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive root system that helps it anchor in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue glow at night. This unique feature makes it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its natural habitat."
