    "intro": "Chusua roborowskyi var. tenii, commonly known as the Tibetan sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a valuable species for ecological studies in high-altitude ecosystems."
