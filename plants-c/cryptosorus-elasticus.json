    "intro": "Cryptosorus elasticus, commonly known as the elastic fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, thin fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine, translucent scales. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, Cryptosorus elasticus is an important indicator species for certain aquatic ecosystems."
