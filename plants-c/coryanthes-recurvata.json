    "intro": "Coryanthes recurvata, commonly known as the sickle-shaped coryanthe, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, hooded flowers that are often brightly colored, with a unique, curving shape that resembles a sickle. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are known for their complex structure, featuring a labellum that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting specific pollinators."
