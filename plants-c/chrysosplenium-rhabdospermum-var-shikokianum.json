    "intro": "Chrysosplenium rhabdospermum var. shikokianum, commonly known as the Shikoku chrysosplenium, is a rare flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its foliage is often covered in fine pubescence, which helps to retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
