    "intro": "Cochlearia fenestrata, commonly known as the fenestrated cress, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as coastal cliffs and limestone soils. Its leaves are usually lobed or divided, and it produces distinctive, elongated pods that contain the seeds. Cochlearia fenestrata is a rare species, often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
