    "intro": "Cyrtochloa luzonica, commonly known as the Luzon flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its flat, narrow leaves and dense, grass-like foliage, typically growing in wetland or marshy environments. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
