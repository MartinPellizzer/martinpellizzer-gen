It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, often clustered in dense inflorescences, making it a distinctive and delicate member of its ecosystem."
