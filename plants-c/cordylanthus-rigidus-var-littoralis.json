    "intro": "Cordylanthus rigidus var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid or coastal habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky areas. This species is an important part of the local flora, supporting pollinators and contributing to the ecological stability of its environment."
