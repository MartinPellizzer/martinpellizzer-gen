    "intro": "Crataegus miranda, commonly known as the Miranda hawthorn, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally considered toxic to humans. Crataegus miranda is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland edges, where it plays a role in supporting local wildlife and providing ornamental value."
