    "intro": "Calceolaria uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower slipper orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive calyx-like structure that encloses the single, showy flower, which resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, while the flower is usually violet or purple in color. Calceolaria uniflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral form."
