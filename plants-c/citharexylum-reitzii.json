    "intro": "Citharexylum reitzii, commonly known as the coral tree, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive coral-like inflorescences, which consist of numerous small, clustered flowers that bloom in clusters of red, pink, or white. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. The coral tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
