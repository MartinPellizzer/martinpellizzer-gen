It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in sandy areas. Chenopodium simplex is valued for its edible leaves, which are rich in nutrients and have a slightly bitter taste."
