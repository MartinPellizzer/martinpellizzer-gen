It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and small white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows or woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
