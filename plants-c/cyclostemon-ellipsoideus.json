    "intro": "Cyclostemon ellipsoideus, commonly known as the elliptic cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It prefers well-drained, sandy soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
