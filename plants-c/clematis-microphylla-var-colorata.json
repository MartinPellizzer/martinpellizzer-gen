It features small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance flowering vine. Its compact size and vibrant blooms make it suitable for trellises, fences, or as a container plant."
