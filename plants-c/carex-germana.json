    "intro": "Carex germana, commonly known as the German sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in early summer. Carex germana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
