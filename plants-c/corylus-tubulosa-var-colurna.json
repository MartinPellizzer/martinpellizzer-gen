    "intro": "Corylus tubulosa var. colurna, commonly known as the Turkish hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to Turkey and parts of the Middle East. It features slender, upright stems with a rough, bark-like texture and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant bears edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which mature in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and nut production. This variety is closely related to other hazelnut species and is valued for its hardiness and adaptability."
