    "intro": "Coccothrinax yunquensis, commonly known as the Yunqu palm, is a species of palm native to Cuba. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed trunk and pinnate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are arranged in panicles, followed by dark blue to black berries. It thrives in coastal and limestone areas, adapting well to saline and dry conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
