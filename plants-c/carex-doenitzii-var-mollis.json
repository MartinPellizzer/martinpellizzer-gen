It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features dense, grass-like leaves that are soft to the touch, giving it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wetland environments."
