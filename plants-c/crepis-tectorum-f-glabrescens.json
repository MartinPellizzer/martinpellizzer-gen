    "intro": "Crepis tectorum f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth wallgrass, is a variant of the common wallgrass. It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant that typically thrives in disturbed soils and rocky areas. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. Its glabrous (smooth) surface distinguishes it from other forms of Crepis tectorum. This subspecies is often found in urban environments and can be a pioneer species in ecological succession."
