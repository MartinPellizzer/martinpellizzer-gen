    "intro": "Cactus olorinus, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of South America. It features a columnar stem covered in dense, pale yellow spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in the evening. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture quickly during rare rainfalls. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
