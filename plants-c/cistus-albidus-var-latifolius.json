    "intro": "Cistus albidus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, silver-green foliage with broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or coastal environments. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and garden landscapes."
