It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically oval or rounded in shape. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Its unique morphological features, including the variation in leaf shape, make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
