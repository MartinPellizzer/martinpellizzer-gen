    "intro": "Carex aquatilis var. rigida, commonly known as rigid water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in environments with consistent moisture. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually stiff and upright, contributing to its rigid appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often submerged or partially submerged in water. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
