    "intro": "Cattleya mossiae var. germinyana, commonly known as the Germinyana Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its striking, fragrant flowers. It features large, showy blooms with a vibrant mix of purple, pink, and white hues, often with a contrasting lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants rather than in soil. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its foliage consists of broad, dark green leaves that support its ornamental value and contribute to its overall aesthetic appeal."
