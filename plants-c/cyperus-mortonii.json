    "intro": "Cyperus mortonii, commonly known as the Morton's flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, often forming dense mats near the water's edge. Its grass-like appearance features triangular stems and small, clustered spikelets that are often pale green or brown in color. Cyperus mortonii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
