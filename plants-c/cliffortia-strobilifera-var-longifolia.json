    "intro": "Cliffortia strobilifera var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf cliffortia, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in terminal clusters, which are followed by small, cone-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native habitat."
