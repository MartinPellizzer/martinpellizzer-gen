    "intro": "Cypripedium vittatum var. tortile, commonly known as the zigzag lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its unique, wavy or zigzag-shaped petals, which give it its common name. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a pouch-like lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, acidic soil. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists alike."
