    "intro": "Cracca coriacea, commonly known as the rough cracca, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in a rough, sandpaper-like texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Cracca coriacea is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
