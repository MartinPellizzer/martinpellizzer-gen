    "intro": "Calestania palustris, commonly known as the marsh calestia, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shallow, freshwater marshes and pond edges. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear small, white to pale green flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Calestania palustris plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic insects and contributing to water filtration."
