    "intro": "Cenchrus sieberianus, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common component of dryland vegetation. Its ecological importance includes soil stabilization and providing habitat for small fauna."
