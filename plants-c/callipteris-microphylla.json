    "intro": "Callipteris microphylla, commonly known as the narrowleaf holly fern, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, dark green, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a compact rosette. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called sorus. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive, feathery appearance. Callipteris microphylla thrives in moist, shaded environments and is well adapted to wetland habitats."
