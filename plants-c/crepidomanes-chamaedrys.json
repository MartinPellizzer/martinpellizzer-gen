    "intro": "Crepidomanes chamaedrys, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and spread across the ground. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
