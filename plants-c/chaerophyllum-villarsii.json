It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its morphology is adapted to withstand harsh mountain climates, with a compact growth form and a short life cycle. Chaerophyllum villarsii is often found in alpine meadows and is a notable species in ecological studies of high-altitude flora."
