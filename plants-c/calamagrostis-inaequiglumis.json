It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically greenish or brownish in hue. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often used in wetland restoration projects. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat conservation."
