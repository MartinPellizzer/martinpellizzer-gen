It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
