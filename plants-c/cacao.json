    "intro": "Cacao, commonly known as the bean of the cacao tree, is native to the tropical regions of South America and parts of the Caribbean. The plant produces pods that contain the seeds, which are the source of cocoa mass used in chocolate production. The cacao tree, *Theobroma cacao*, thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are large and elliptical, and the flowers grow directly on the trunk and branches. The fruit matures over several months, and the beans inside are harvested, fermented, and processed to develop their rich flavor."
