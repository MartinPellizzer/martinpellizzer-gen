    "intro": "Coleus goudotii, commonly known as the African violet or purple heart, is a tropical plant native to Africa. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range from deep purples to rich reds. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often clustered in whorls along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Coleus goudotii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage and ease of care."
