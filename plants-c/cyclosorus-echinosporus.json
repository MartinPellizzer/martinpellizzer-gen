It is a small, mat-forming aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, spiny spores that are released into the water. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its dense appearance. The species is often found in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it plays a minor role in the ecosystem."
