    "intro": "Ceratophyllum demersum var. echinatum, commonly known as spiked hornwort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and Asia. It features dense, branching stems covered with small, spiky leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces tiny, floating flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is often found in still or slow-moving waters, where it can form dense mats on the surface or submerged vegetation. This variety is valued in aquariums and ponds for its ability to provide oxygen and habitat for aquatic life."
