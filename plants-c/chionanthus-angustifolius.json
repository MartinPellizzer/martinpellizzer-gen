    "intro": "Chionanthus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chionanthus, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers in early spring, which are surrounded by showy, pale green bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
