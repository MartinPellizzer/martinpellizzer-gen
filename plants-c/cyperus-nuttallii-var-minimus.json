    "intro": "Cyperus nuttallii var. minimus, commonly known as the dwarf sedges, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, clustered inflorescences. This variety is typically found in moist to wet soils, often in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its small size and dense growth habit make it an effective ground cover in wetland ecosystems. The plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic biodiversity."
