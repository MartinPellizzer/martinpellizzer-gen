It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of short, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
