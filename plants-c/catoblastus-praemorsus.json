    "intro": "Catoblastus praemorsus, commonly known as the red-tailed spider orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate moisture and light. Its unique floral structure includes a spurred lip that serves as a nectar source for specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
