    "intro": "Calanthe curvatoascendens, commonly known as the ascending curling calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and possesses lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hair. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded environments where it thrives. Calanthe curvatoascendens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
