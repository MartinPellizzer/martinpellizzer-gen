    "intro": "Cyclosorus peekelii, commonly known as the Peekel's water fern, is a small aquatic fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has a creeping rhizome that forms dense mats on the water surface or just below it. Its fronds are delicate and feather-like, with a distinctive spiral arrangement of pinnae. It plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
