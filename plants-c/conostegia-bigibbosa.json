    "intro": "Conostegia bigibbosa, commonly known as the two-globed caryota, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles. Its fruits are three-lobed and contain a single seed, making it distinct from other palms. Conostegia bigibbosa is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental foliage."
