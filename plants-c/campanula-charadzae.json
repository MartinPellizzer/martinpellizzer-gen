    "intro": "Campanula charadzae, commonly known as the Charadza bellflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the Caucasus region. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Campanula charadzae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations."
