It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves with stipules, which are small leaf-like structures at the base of the leaf stalks. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often forming dense colonies. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
