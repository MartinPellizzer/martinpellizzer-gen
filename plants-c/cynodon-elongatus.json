    "intro": "Cynodon elongatus, commonly known as the tall Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread rapidly and form dense turf. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for lawns and erosion control. Its adaptability to various soil types contributes to its widespread distribution and ecological significance."
