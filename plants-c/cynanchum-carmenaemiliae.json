    "intro": "Cynanchum carmenaemiliae, commonly known as the Carmenaemilia milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to grow in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
