    "intro": "Clermontia parviflora var. umbraticola, commonly known as the shaded clermontia, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its small, white flowers and dark green, glossy leaves that thrive in shaded, moist environments. This variant is typically found in mesic to wet forest habitats, often growing on rocky slopes or in streamside areas. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this unique botanical specimen from habitat loss and invasive species."
