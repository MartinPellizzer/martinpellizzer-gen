    "intro": "Cereus chiloensis var. polygonus, commonly known as the Chilean night bloomer, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Its unique morphology and nocturnal flowering make it a striking addition to desert gardens."
