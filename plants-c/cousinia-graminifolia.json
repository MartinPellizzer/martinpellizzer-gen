    "intro": "Cousinia graminifolia, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming low, cushion-like tufts. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems and a high tolerance for drought. Cousinia graminifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert animals."
