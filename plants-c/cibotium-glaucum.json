    "intro": "Cibotium glaucum, commonly known as the silver tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant has a robust, woody trunk covered in a thick layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, meaning they have a double division, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Cibotium glaucum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in primary rainforests."
