    "intro": "Cyathula prostrata var. lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in cup-like cyathia, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. The leaves are lanceolate, hence the specific epithet \"lancifolia,\" and are usually covered in a waxy cuticle. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and wetlands. The plant is noted for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive."
