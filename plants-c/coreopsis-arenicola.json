    "intro": "Coreopsis arenicola, commonly known as beach coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the United States. It is well adapted to sandy and salty environments, making it a hardy species that thrives in dune ecosystems. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it conserve moisture. Beach coreopsis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
