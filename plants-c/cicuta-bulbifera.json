    "intro": "Cicuta bulbifera, commonly known as the water hemlock, is a highly toxic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and umbrella-shaped clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces bulbils at the base of its stem, which can sprout into new plants, aiding in its spread. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance. Due to its potent toxicity, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in the region."
