    "intro": "Caulanthus, commonly known as the \"meadow vetchling,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are typically found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. They are characterized by their slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. Caulanthus species are often short-lived annuals or biennials, and they play a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. The genus includes over 50 species, many of which are adapted to temperate climates."
