    "intro": "Crotalaria simplex, commonly known as the slender crotalaria, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod-like seed capsules and compound leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability due to root nodules. Crotalaria simplex is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some traditional medicine practices."
