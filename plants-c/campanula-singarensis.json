    "intro": "Campanula singarensis, commonly known as the Singareni bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a white throat. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Campanula singarensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
