    "intro": "Cheilanthes contracta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in rocky soils and crevices, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family. Cheilanthes contracta is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
