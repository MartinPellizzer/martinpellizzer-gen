    "intro": "Cynanchum molle, commonly known as soft milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes other milkweeds known for their milky sap. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its flowers are showy, with a distinctive horn-shaped corona, and it produces small, round fruits that contain toxic seeds. Cynanchum molle is also noted for its medicinal properties, though it contains compounds that can be harmful if ingested."
