    "intro": "Chrozophora villosa, commonly known as hairy false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in wetland environments. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in the spring, producing small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves gives it its common name and helps it retain moisture in its native habitat."
