    "intro": "Crinum revolutum, commonly known as the revolute crinum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem that bears clusters of fragrant blooms, often appearing in summer. Its bulbous underground stem stores nutrients, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Crinum revolutum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty."
