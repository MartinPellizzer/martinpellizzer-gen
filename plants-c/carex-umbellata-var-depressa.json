    "intro": "Carex umbellata var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wet meadows, and thrives in full to partial sunlight. It produces small, clustered inflorescences called umbels, which are a distinguishing feature of the species. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is often used in wetland restoration and landscaping projects."
