    "intro": "Carex divulsa var. guestphalica, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green and slightly hairy. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a useful plant for erosion control."
