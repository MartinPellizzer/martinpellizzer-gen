    "intro": "Coccoloba inaequilatera, commonly known as the unequal-armed coral tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America, where it typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The plant's unique morphology and adaptability to coastal environments make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
