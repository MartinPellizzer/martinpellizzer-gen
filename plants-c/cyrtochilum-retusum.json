    "intro": "Cyrtochilum retusum, commonly known as the blunt-lipped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and intricate floral structure. The plant produces pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, bluntly shaped lip. Cyrtochilum retusum typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its botanical features make it a unique and interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
