It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has a slender, upright stem that bears a single spike of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette at the base of the stem. The orchid's flowers are characterized by their delicate structure and lack of prominent petals, making it a unique member of the Orchidaceae family."
