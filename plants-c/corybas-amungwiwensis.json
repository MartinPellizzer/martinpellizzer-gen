    "intro": "Corybas amungwiwensis, commonly known as the Amungwiwensis Helmet Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of New Guinea. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flower that is typically dark red or purple in color, with intricate veining. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, which blooms during the cooler months of the year. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in dense forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
