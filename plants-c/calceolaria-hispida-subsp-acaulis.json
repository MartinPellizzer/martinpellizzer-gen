    "intro": "Calceolaria hispida subsp. acaulis, commonly known as the woolly calceolaria, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, pouch-like flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses, though it requires careful attention to light and moisture conditions."
