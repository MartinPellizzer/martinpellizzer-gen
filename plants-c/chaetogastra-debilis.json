    "intro": "Chaetogastra debilis, commonly known as the weak-stemmed chaetogastra, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered umbels of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided lobes that give it a delicate appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native range."
