    "intro": "Cheilanthes sulphurea, commonly known as the sulfur rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dense, evergreen foliage. The leaves are typically gray-green to silver in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found on limestone or granite outcrops. This hardy plant is well adapted to harsh conditions and is a common sight in desert landscapes."
