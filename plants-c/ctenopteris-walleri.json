    "intro": "Ctenopteris walleri, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea holly, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found near coastal areas or in moist forests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Ctenopteris walleri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities."
