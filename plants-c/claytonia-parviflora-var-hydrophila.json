    "intro": "Claytonia parviflora var. hydrophila, commonly known as the water violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features basal rosettes of glossy, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and slightly succulent. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to waterlogged conditions, with a short, stout stem and a compact growth form."
