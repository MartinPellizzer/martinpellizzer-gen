    "intro": "Cojoba tubulifera, commonly known as the tubular sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and western Atlantic. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and large, showy flowers with five petals and a distinctive tubular corolla. The plant thrives in sandy soils near the shoreline and is often found in salt marshes and mangrove swamps. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. Cojoba tubulifera is also valued for its ability to tolerate saline conditions, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
