    "intro": "Carex limosa var. stygia, commonly known as the swamp sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are wind-pollinated, typical of many sedges. It thrives in moist to saturated soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a key role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
