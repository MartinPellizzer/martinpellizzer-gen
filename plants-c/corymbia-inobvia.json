It is native to the tropical and subtropical regions of northern Australia, particularly in Queensland and the Northern Territory. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. It typically grows as a tall tree, reaching heights of up to 30 meters, with a rough, flaky bark. The fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
