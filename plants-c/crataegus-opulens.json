It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and showy white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red, juicy berries known as haws, which are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus opulens is often used in hedgerows and for ornamental purposes due to its attractive form and seasonal interest."
