    "intro": "Calycophyllum spruceanum f. peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian calycophyllum, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and possesses small, leathery leaves with a dense, glandular surface. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Peru and is adapted to cool, moist, and nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
