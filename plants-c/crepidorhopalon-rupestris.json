    "intro": "Crepidorhopalon rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in well-drained soils, often on limestone or sandstone outcrops. The plant features basal rosettes of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its yellow flowers appear in spring, producing a showy display that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species, often found in isolated populations."
