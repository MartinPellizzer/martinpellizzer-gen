    "intro": "Cactus nobilis, commonly known as the noble cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration. Cactus nobilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in low-maintenance gardens."
