    "intro": "Carex capilliformis var. major, commonly known as the tall sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikes of small, greenish-brown flowers in the summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form extensive colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a bluish-green hue, making it a valuable plant for wetland restoration projects."
