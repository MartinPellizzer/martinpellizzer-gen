    "intro": "Carex bonariensis var. trachycystis, commonly known as the rough-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with rough, textured leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the summer, which are followed by maturing brown seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
