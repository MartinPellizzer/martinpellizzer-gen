    "intro": "Capparis brachybotrya, commonly known as the narrow-fruited caper, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round, green fruits that mature to a reddish color. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Capparis brachybotrya is part of the Capparaceae family, which includes other caper species known for their edible flowers and fruits."
