    "intro": "Caracasia, commonly known as the white hellebore, is a perennial plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its large, waxy, white or pale green leaves and its showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Caracasia has a long history of use in traditional medicine, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking early-flowering plants."
