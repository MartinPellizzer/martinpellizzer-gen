    "intro": "Cannomois, commonly known as the blue marijuana plant, is a unique variant of Cannabis sativa characterized by its striking blue or purple foliage. Its distinctive coloration is due to the high concentration of anthocyanin pigments, which are produced in response to cooler temperatures and increased light exposure. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with serrated leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. It is cultivated for its ornamental value and has also been studied for its potential medicinal properties. However, its legal status varies widely depending on the region and local regulations."
