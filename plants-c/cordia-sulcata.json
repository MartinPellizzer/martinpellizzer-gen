    "intro": "Cordia sulcata, commonly known as the African starfruit or sour sop, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Africa and parts of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and distinctive yellow or orange fruit with a star-shaped calyx. The fruit is typically sour and is used in culinary applications, though it can also be fermented into beverages. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit. It has a shallow root system, making it susceptible to drought and requiring regular watering in cultivation."
