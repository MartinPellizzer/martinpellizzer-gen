    "intro": "Cachrys herderi, commonly known as the Herder's cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
