    "intro": "Cyclosorus subdentatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters, and are pollinated by insects. Cyclosorus subdentatus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
