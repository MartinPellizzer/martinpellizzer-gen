    "intro": "Croton, commonly known as the spurge or croton plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its diverse foliage, with leaves that can be smooth, waxy, or hairy, and often displaying vibrant colors such as red, yellow, or orange. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Many species of Croton are cultivated as ornamental plants due to their striking leaves and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Some species are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
