    "intro": "Cydonia japonica var. alba, commonly known as the white Japanese quince, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange to red fruit that ripens in autumn. The plant is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and has a rugged, bushy growth habit. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant. The fruit, while not typically eaten raw, is used in jams and preserves due to its tart flavor."
