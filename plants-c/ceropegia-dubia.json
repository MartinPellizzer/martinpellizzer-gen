    "intro": "Ceropegia dubia, commonly known as the \"Lion's Head\" or \"Bunny Ear Plant,\" is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, often with a distinctive hood-like structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Ceropegia dubia is prized for its unique foliage and is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
