    "intro": "Cynanchum revolutum, commonly known as the creeping milkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Cynanchum revolutum is also known for its latex-like milky sap, which can be toxic to some animals."
