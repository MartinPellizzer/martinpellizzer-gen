    "intro": "Cyperus mudugensis, commonly known as the Mudug sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Horn of Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae, although it is often classified under the sedge family Cyperaceae. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its morphology includes slender, grass-like stems and narrow leaves, with small, clustered inflorescences. Cyperus mudugensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystems."
