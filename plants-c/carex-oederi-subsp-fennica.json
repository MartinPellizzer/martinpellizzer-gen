    "intro": "Carex oederi subsp. fennica, commonly known as the Fennoscandian sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe and parts of Russia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as peat bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. Carex oederi subsp. fennica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wetland ecosystems."
