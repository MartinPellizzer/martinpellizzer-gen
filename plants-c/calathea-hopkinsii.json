    "intro": "Calathea hopkinsii, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with intricate patterns of green, silver, and pink. The leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often curling upward at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent humidity and well-draining soil. Calathea hopkinsii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and air-purifying properties."
