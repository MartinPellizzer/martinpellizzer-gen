    "intro": "Crepis borealis, commonly known as the Arctic mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in open, rocky, or sandy habitats where it can withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its small, spoon-shaped leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Crepis borealis produces tiny seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding its survival in remote and challenging landscapes."
