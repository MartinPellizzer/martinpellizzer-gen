    "intro": "Craspedaria lagopodioides, commonly known as the woolly sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Craspedaria lagopodioides is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations."
