    "intro": "Carex vesicaria f. polystachya, commonly known as the clustered bur reed, is a variant of the bur reed species native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces clusters of small, spiky inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a rhizomatous growth habit. This form is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
