    "intro": "Crepidomanes brevipes, commonly known as the short-stalked bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and specialized structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. This plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures are borne on long, slender stems, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that are often submerged. Crepidomanes brevipes plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microscopic life."
