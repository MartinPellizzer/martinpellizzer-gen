    "intro": "Crinum hydrophilum, commonly known as the water crinum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant features strap-like, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help the plant survive periods of drought. Crinum hydrophilum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers or wetlands."
