    "intro": "Convolvulus ventricosus, commonly known as the bladder vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. The plant has distinctive heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer. Its seed pods are inflated and resemble bladders, which is where the common name originates. The species is known for its adaptability to arid conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
