    "intro": "Cerothamnus cerifer, commonly known as the waxflower, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and clusters of small, waxy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, providing a striking contrast to the soft, fuzzy flowers. Cerothamnus cerifer is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
