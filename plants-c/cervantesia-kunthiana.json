    "intro": "Cervantesia kunthiana, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its gray-green, woolly foliage and showy yellow to orange flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged drought conditions. Its small, fleshy leaves help reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Cervantesia kunthiana plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and provides nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
