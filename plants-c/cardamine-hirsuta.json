    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta, commonly known as hairy bittercress, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. It has a short life cycle, often completing its growth and reproduction within a single growing season. Botanically, it is notable for its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name."
