It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in rocky and calcareous soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces vibrant blue to purple flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
