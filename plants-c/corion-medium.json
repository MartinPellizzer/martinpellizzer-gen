    "intro": "Corion medium, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that resemble dandelions. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It produces small, oval seeds with pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal. Corion medium is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
