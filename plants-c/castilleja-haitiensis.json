    "intro": "Castilleja haitiensis, commonly known as Haitian milkweed, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Haiti and the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reddish or orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a slender, erect stem with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It forms a symbiotic relationship with the roots of other plants, drawing water and nutrients from them. Castilleja haitiensis is adapted to grow in dry, open habitats such as forests and grasslands."
