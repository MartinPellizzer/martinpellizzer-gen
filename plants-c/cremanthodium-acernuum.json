    "intro": "Cremanthodium acernuum, commonly known as the alpine goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces yellow-orange ray florets surrounded by tubular disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Cremanthodium acernuum is often found in alpine meadows and is a symbol of the resilience of flora in extreme climates."
