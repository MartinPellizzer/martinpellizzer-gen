    "intro": "Cyathea longipaleata, commonly known as the longipaleata tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments. Cyathea longipaleata plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's native forests, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
