    "intro": "Cadetia sepikana, commonly known as the Sepik cadetia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs known for their diverse floral structures. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with four petals and prominent stamens. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture, adapted to the humid and shaded environments where it thrives. Cadetia sepikana is primarily found in moist, forested areas and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and ecological role."
