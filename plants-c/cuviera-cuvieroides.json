    "intro": "Cuviera cuvieroides, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions to thrive. Its morphology includes a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs and linear leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited natural propagation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
