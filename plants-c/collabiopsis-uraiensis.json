    "intro": "Collabiopsis uraiensis, commonly known as the Uraiensis lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species belonging to the family Caliciaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces, typically in humid and shaded environments. The thallus is dark brown to black, with a granular texture, and it lacks distinct lobes or cracks. It is found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions, often on calcareous substrates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
