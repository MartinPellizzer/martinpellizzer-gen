    "intro": "Castelia, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Plumbaginaceae and is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and rocky coastlines. Castelia has a compact growth habit and is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds makes it well-suited for maritime environments."
