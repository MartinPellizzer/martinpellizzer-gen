    "intro": "Carpinus marlipoensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
