    "intro": "Circaeaster, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its distinctive, spiky blue or purple flowers. The plant has silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Circaeaster thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliffs. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
