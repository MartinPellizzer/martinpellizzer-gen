    "intro": "Chrysanthemum segetum, commonly known as the field chrysanthemum, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow to brown composite flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Due to its hardy nature and adaptability, it is considered a common weed in agricultural settings."
