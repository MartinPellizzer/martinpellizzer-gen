    "intro": "Columnea longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved flame flower, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting hummingbirds and other pollinators. The plant has lance-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea longifolia is often cultivated as a decorative plant for its striking appearance and ecological value."
