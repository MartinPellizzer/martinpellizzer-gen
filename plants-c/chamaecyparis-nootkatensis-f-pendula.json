    "intro": "Chamaecyparis nootkatensis f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cedar, is a unique cultivar of the western red cedar. It is characterized by its cascading, drooping branches that create a striking, weeping appearance. This form is a result of natural mutations and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. The plant retains the typical needle-like foliage of the parent species, with a rich, dark green color. It is hardy in USDA zones 5-8 and prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
