    "intro": "Carya aquatica, commonly known as the water hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by oval, green-to-brown nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. Its seeds are dispersed by water, as the fruit floats, allowing the plant to colonize wetland areas. Carya aquatica is often found in swamps, river valleys, and other moist habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments."
