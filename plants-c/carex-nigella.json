    "intro": "Carex nigella, commonly known as black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, dark purple to black flowers. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. The plant is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
