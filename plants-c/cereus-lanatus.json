    "intro": "Cereus lanatus, commonly known as the woolly night bloomer, is a cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to desert conditions. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming habit."
