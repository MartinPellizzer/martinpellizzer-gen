    "intro": "Clethra fagifolia var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored sweet pepper bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white to pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. These flowers are followed by cone-like fruits that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
