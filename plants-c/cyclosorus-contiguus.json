    "intro": "Cyclosorus contiguus, commonly known as the common water clover, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It has a creeping rhizome and produces small, floating leaves that are typically oval or kidney-shaped. The plant is characterized by its ability to form dense mats on the water surface, which can affect water flow and light penetration. It is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands. Cyclosorus contiguus plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
