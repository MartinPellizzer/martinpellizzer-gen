The plant produces unique, bell-shaped flowers that are often white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, making it a sought-after species for tropical and subtropical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
