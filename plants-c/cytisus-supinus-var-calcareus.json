    "intro": "Cytisus supinus var. calcareus, commonly known as the limestone broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium, and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. This variety is closely related to other cytisus species but is distinguished by its preference for alkaline environments."
