    "intro": "Cyperus virens var. robustus, commonly known as the broadleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common weed in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
