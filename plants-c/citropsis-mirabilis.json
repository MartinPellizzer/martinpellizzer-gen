    "intro": "Citropsis mirabilis, commonly known as the miracle cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features a compact, globular stem covered in dense, spiny bracts that give it a striking appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the dry season, adding a burst of color to its desert habitat. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and adapting to harsh conditions. Citropsis mirabilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in low-water environments."
