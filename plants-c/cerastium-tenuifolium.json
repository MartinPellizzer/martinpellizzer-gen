    "intro": "Cerastium tenuifolium, commonly known as lesser mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Cerastium tenuifolium is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ability to spread easily through runners."
