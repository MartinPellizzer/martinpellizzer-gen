    "intro": "Cyphopsis, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are often found in rocky or sandy soils. They are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and showy yellow or white flowers. Cyphopsis species are typically short-lived annuals or biennials, with some species producing a single flower per stem. The genus is noted for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and contributing to local biodiversity."
