    "intro": "Collaea scarlatina var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved collaea, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in spring, adding a splash of color to its alpine habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
