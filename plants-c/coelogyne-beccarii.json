    "intro": "Coelogyne beccarii, commonly known as the Beccari's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences and vibrant, often fragrant flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water, which is essential for its survival in the dry seasons. Coelogyne beccarii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
