    "intro": "Carex hudsonii, commonly known as Hudson's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, grasses, and rushes. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its leaves are grass-like, with a triangular cross-section, and it produces small, clustered spikelets as its flowers. Carex hudsonii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
