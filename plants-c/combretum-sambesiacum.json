    "intro": "Combretum sambesiacum, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and clusters of small, bright red flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
