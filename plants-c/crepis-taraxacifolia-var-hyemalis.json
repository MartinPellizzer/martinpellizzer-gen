    "intro": "Crepis taraxacifolia var. hyemalis, commonly known as the winter hawk's-beard, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in early spring, which are surrounded by bracts that resemble a hawk's head. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This variety is notable for its early blooming habit and cold tolerance, making it a valuable plant in early-season pollinator support."
