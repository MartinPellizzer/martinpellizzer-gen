    "intro": "Cnicus replicatus, commonly known as the common groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual or biennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring hairy stems and alternate leaves with lobed or toothed margins. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Cnicus replicatus is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its botanical characteristics make it adaptable to various environments, contributing to its widespread distribution."
