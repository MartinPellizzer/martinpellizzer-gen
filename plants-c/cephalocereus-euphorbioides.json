    "intro": "Cephalocereus euphorbioides, commonly known as the desert rose cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive, spiny stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming at night. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to arid environments. It is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water once established."
