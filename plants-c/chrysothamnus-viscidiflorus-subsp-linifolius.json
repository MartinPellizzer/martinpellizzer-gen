    "intro": "Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus subsp. linifolius, commonly known as stickyflower goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-green foliage and small, sticky, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture, which is a common feature in the genus Chrysothamnus. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid climates and limited water availability."
