    "intro": "Clausena wightii, commonly known as the Indian blackberry, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall. The plant produces small, fragrant white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The fruit is edible, though the taste is often described as tart or acidic, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
