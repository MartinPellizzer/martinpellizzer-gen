It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Chloropyron is often found in moist, disturbed soils in meadows and along streambanks. It is a perennial herb that is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
