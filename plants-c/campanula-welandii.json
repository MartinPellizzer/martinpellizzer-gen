    "intro": "Campanula welandii, commonly known as the Weland bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This species is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine habitats."
