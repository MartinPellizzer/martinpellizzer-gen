    "intro": "Campanula cochleariifolia f. tyrolensis, commonly known as the Tyrol bellflower, is a rare and striking variant of the bellflower species. It is characterized by its distinctive blue to violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is native to the alpine regions of Central Europe, particularly the Tyrol area, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. It is a perennial herb that grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, featuring hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native environment."
