    "intro": "Coppensia martiana, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Coppensia martiana is considered a rare and endangered species."
