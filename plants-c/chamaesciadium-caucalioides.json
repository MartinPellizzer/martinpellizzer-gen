It is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant features compound leaves with a fern-like appearance and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
