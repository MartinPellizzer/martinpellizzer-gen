    "intro": "Callitriche decussata, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale blue, and appear in clusters near the water's surface. Callitriche decussata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
