    "intro": "Clermontia mauiensis, commonly known as Maui's ghost or the Maui fern, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively on the island of Maui in Hawaii. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky areas. Due to its limited habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts. Its unique appearance and restricted distribution make it a significant species in Hawaiian botanical studies."
