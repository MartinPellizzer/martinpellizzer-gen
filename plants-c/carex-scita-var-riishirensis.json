It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant typically features narrow, sword-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
