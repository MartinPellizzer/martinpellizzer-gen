    "intro": "Cuscuta salina, commonly known as salt dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It is native to coastal regions and thrives in saline environments, often found growing on other plants in salt marshes or dunes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a slender, winding stem that attaches to its host through specialized structures called haustoria. Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable host plants and saline conditions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host species."
