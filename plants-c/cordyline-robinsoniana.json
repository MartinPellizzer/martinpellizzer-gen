    "intro": "Cordyline robinsoniana, commonly known as the Red-veined Driftwood Palm, is a striking ornamental plant native to the island of New Guinea. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and broad, dark green leaves with distinctive red veins. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters at the base of the leaves, followed by red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in tropical gardens. Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is a prized addition to botanical collections."
