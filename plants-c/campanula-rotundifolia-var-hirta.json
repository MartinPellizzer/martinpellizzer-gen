It is characterized by its rounded, hairy leaves and bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves is a distinguishing feature of this variety."
