    "intro": "Cyperus capensis var. polyanthemus, commonly known as the Cape flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clumps, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color, with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in wet or marshy environments. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in water gardens and bog landscapes."
