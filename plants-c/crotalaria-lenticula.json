    "intro": "Crotalaria lenticula, commonly known as the lesser crotalaria, is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant features palmately compound leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its allelopathic properties, it can inhibit the growth of nearby plants, making it both a weed and a natural pest control agent."
