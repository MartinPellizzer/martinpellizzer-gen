    "intro": "Canschi, commonly known as the golden dewdrop or *Orobanche coerulescens*, is a parasitic flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, often attaching itself to species like *Atriplex* or *Chenopodium*. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its host's foliage. Its root system is highly specialized, forming haustoria to penetrate the host's vascular system. Due to its unique ecological role and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
