    "intro": "Callicarpa apiculata, commonly known as the red-berried beauty or Chinese beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by vibrant red berries in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 feet and thrives in partial to full sun. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and the berries are often consumed by birds and small mammals. Callicarpa apiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its colorful fruit and attractive foliage."
