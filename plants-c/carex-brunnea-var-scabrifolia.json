    "intro": "Carex brunnea var. scabrifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved sedges, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its specific epithet \"scabrifolia.\" The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually green or brown in color. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
