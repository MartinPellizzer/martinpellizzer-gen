    "intro": "Corybas cymatilis, commonly known as the black helleborine, is a species of orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and a single, strikingly colored flower that typically ranges from deep purple to black. The plant is terrestrial, growing in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its flowers are protandrous, meaning the male parts mature before the female parts, which is a unique reproductive strategy. Corybas cymatilis is also notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, showcasing its adaptability to its native habitat."
