    "intro": "Cyperus cayennensis var. redolens, commonly known as the red swamp cyperus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant features slender, grass-like stems and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and often have a reddish tinge, which contributes to its common name. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
