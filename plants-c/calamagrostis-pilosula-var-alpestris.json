    "intro": "Calamagrostis pilosula var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that bear feathery plumes of pale green to silver-blue foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in cooler climates. Calamagrostis pilosula var. alpestris is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
