    "intro": "Cypripedium corrugatum var. obesum, commonly known as the fat-lip cattail, is a distinctive orchid species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble those of the common cattail, with a yellow lip that is broader and more prominent than in typical cypripedium species. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often forming dense clumps that help anchor the plant in its aquatic environment. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique floral display."
