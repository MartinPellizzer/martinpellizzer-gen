    "intro": "Cicuta virosa var. intermedia, commonly known as the European water hemlock, is a highly toxic member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in late spring. The plant contains potent toxic compounds, primarily cicutoxin, which can be lethal to humans and animals. It typically grows in wet, marshy areas and is often found near water sources. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in Europe."
