    "intro": "Caladenia tensa, commonly known as the Narrow-leafed Spider-orchid, is an endemic species of orchid found in southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spider-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces a single, narrow leaf and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Caladenia tensa thrives in sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
