    "intro": "Carex guthnickiana, commonly known as the Guthnick's sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to North America and is typically found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality. Carex guthnickiana is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in aquatic and semi-aquatic environments."
