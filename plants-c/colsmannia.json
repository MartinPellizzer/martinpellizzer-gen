    "intro": "Colsmannia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. These plants are characterized by their compact rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in a variety of colors. Colsmannia species are typically evergreen and thrive in humid, well-drained soil. They are popular as houseplants due to their ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. The flowers are pollinated primarily by small insects, and the genus includes several species such as Colsmannia caulescens and Colsmannia simplex."
