    "intro": "Cattleya boissieri, commonly known as the Boissier's Cattleya, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange, with a distinctive purple lip. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat with limited rainfall. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to conserve moisture. Cattleya boissieri is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively ease of cultivation."
