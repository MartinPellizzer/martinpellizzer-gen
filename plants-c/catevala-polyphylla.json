    "intro": "Catevala polyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in rich, organic soil. Catevala polyphylla is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
