    "intro": "Campanula hederifolia, commonly known as the ivy-leaved bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, ivy-like leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Campanula hederifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
