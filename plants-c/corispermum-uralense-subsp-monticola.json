    "intro": "Corispermum uralense subsp. monticola, commonly known as the mountain corispermum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it has adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its seeds are encased in a hard, dry fruit, which is dispersed by wind. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
