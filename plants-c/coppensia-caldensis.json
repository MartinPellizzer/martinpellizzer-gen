    "intro": "Coppensia caldensis, commonly known as the Calde\u00f1o orchid, is a unique plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Coppensia caldensis has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its challenging habitat. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and botanists."
