    "intro": "Cinnagrostis setiflora, commonly known as the silky goatgrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fluffy, feathery seed heads that give it a soft, silky appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the grass family. Cinnagrostis setiflora is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its tolerance to arid conditions."
