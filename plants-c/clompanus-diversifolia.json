It features delicate, feather-like fronds with a distinctive variegation pattern of green and white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. Clompanus diversifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and air-purifying qualities."
