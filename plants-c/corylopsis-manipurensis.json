    "intro": "Corylopsis manipurensis, commonly known as the Manipur yellow flame, is a flowering shrub native to the eastern Himalayas, particularly in India and Nepal. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a striking contrast to the winter landscape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, while the stems are usually woody and branched. Corylopsis manipurensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its seasonal floral display."
