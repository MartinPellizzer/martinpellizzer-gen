It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that often display a combination of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant's inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe, which is typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The species is noted for its unique pollination mechanism, attracting specific insect pollinators with its vivid coloration and scent."
