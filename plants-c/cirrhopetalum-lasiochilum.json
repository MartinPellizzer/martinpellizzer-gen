    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum lasiochilum, commonly known as the wooly-lipped bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It typically grows at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters, where it thrives in rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
