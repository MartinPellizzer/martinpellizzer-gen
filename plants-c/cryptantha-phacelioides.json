    "intro": "Cryptantha phacelioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cryptantha phacelioides is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in regions with limited moisture."
