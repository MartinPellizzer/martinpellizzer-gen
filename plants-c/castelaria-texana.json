    "intro": "Castelaria texana, commonly known as Texas castelaria, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of hairs. Castelaria texana is typically found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
