    "intro": "Cyperus bracteatus, commonly known as the broadleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Cyperus bracteatus thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its adaptability to moist soils makes it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
