It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in saline and wetland environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a common invasive species in salt marshes.
