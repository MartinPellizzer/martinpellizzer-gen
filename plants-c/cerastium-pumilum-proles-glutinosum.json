    "intro": "Cerastium pumilum proles glutinosum, commonly known as sticky mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy, and often sticky leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early spring, which are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. Its stems are prostrate, often rooting at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The sticky secretions on its leaves and stems are thought to deter herbivores and aid in moisture retention."
