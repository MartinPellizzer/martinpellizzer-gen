    "intro": "Cyperus ovularis var. sphaericus, commonly known as the globe sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features compact, rounded inflorescences that give it its common name, and its foliage is typically narrow and grassy in appearance. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, and is often found in shallow water or moist soil. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system and spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize wetland soils."
