It is characterized by its thick, waxy, dark green leaves that are highly resistant to drought and pests. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically blooming in the summer months. Clusia rigida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and long-lasting flowers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
