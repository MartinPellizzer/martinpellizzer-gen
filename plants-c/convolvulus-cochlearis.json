    "intro": "Convolvulus cochlearis, commonly known as the earleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or blue. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. Its rapid growth habit and climbing tendency make it a common weed in agricultural fields and along roadsides. The seeds are small, dry, and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
