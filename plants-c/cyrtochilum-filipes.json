    "intro": "Cyrtochilum filipes, commonly known as the slender-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of South America. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, a common trait among orchids. Cyrtochilum filipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
