    "intro": "Colobium, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It consists of several species that are typically annual or biennial herbs, characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and yellow flower heads. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a hairy surface, while the stems are often upright and branching. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that are enclosed in a pappus, aiding in their spread. Colobium species are often found in disturbed soils and are common in temperate regions across Europe and Asia."
