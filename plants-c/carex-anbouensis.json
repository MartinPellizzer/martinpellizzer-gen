    "intro": "Carex anbouensis, commonly known as the Eastern Marsh Sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to wetland habitats in eastern North America, particularly in regions with moist, acidic soils. The plant produces grass-like leaves and spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Carex anbouensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed wetland environments."
