    "intro": "Celosia pandurata, commonly known as the flame-of-the-forest, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, vivid red or orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple branches and a compact form. Celosia pandurata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
