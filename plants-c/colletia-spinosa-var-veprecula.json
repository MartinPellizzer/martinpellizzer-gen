    "intro": "Colletia spinosa var. veprecula, commonly known as the hairy candelabra cactus, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It features a branched stem that grows close to the ground, often forming dense clusters. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system to survive in dry conditions. This variety is characterized by its hairy texture and is adapted to thrive in harsh, semi-desert environments."
