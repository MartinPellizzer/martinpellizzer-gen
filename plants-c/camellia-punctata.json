    "intro": "Camellia punctata, commonly known as the spotted camellia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a distinctive red or purple blotch on the petals. The plant produces elliptical, leathery leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. Camellia punctata thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and prefers partial to full shade. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a potted plant."
