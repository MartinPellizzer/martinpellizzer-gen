    "intro": "Carduus prasinus, commonly known as the green thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves and stems are typically used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
