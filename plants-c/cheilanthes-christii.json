    "intro": "Cheilanthes christii, commonly known as the Christ's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and features small, leathery, dark green leaves. Native to arid and rocky habitats in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, it is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. Its unique morphology and ecological tolerance make it a notable species in xerophytic plant communities."
