    "intro": "Carludovica rivularis, commonly known as the river fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and rivers. The plant has long, slender fronds that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. It plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for aquatic life. Its presence is often an indicator of clean, well-oxygenated water."
