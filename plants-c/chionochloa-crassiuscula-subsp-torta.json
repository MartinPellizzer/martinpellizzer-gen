    "intro": "Chionochloa crassiuscula subsp. torta, commonly known as the tufted grass or alpine hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, and it is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude regions."
