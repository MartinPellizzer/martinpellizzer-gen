    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as western bitterweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and fuzzy, silver-green foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different floral morphology compared to other subspecies of Chrysothamnus."
