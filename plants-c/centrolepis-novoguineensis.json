    "intro": "Centrolepis novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea centrolepis, is a unique monocotyledonous plant native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance with a single, unbranched stem and a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered at the base of the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
