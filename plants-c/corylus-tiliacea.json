    "intro": "Corylus tiliacea, commonly known as the Persian hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces oval, edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which are typically harvested in the autumn. The plant has alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rough texture and serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period for proper fruit development. The species is valued for its ornamental value and for its nuts, which are used in both culinary and medicinal applications."
