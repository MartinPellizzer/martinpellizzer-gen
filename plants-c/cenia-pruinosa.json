It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often have a whitish or purplish waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white or yellowish flowers that are typically followed by round, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Cenia pruinosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
