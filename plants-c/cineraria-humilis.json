    "intro": "Cineraria humilis, commonly known as the rock cineraria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features silvery-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of blue, violet, and white during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
