    "intro": "Crepidomanes scandens, commonly known as the climbing thistle, is a perennial plant native to the northern regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its woody, scrambling growth habit and is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and wetlands. The plant produces showy, purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with spiny margins, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. Crepidomanes scandens plays a role in ecological succession and provides habitat for various insect species."
