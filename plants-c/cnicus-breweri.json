    "intro": "Cnicus breweri, commonly known as the brewer's knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow daisy-like flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open areas such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It has small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Cnicus breweri is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions due to habitat loss and fragmentation."
