    "intro": "Cereus ulei, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night and emit a strong fragrance. These flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few hours before closing in the morning. Cereus ulei is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for desert gardens."
