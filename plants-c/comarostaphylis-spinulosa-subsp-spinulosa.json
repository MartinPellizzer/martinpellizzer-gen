    "intro": "Comarostaphylis spinulosa subsp. spinulosa, commonly known as the spinylug grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
