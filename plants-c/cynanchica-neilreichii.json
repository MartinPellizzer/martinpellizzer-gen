    "intro": "Cynanchica neilreichii, commonly known as the Neilreich's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by legume-like pods containing seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and semi-desert habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
