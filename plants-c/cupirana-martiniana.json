    "intro": "Cupirana martiniana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it has leathery, elliptical leaves. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in humid, shaded environments within the Atlantic Forest biome. Due to overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
