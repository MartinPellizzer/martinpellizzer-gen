    "intro": "Cynorkis purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-flowered cycad, is a species of cycad native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and its distinctive, fan-shaped leaves that are dark green and leathery. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with the female cones being particularly ornate and often reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its slow growth rate and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
