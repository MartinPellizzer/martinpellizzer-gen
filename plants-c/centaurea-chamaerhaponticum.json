    "intro": "Centaurea chamaerhaponticum, commonly known as the Turkish thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its spiny leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant has adapted to survive in harsh environmental conditions. Centaurea chamaerhaponticum is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine."
