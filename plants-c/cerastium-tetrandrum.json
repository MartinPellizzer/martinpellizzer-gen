    "intro": "Cerastium tetrandrum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae). It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with four stamens, typical of the genus Cerastium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its delicate structure and early blooming period make it a notable component of early spring flora."
