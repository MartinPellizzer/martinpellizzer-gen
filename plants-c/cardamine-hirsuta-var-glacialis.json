    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. glacialis, commonly known as the Alpine hairy bittercress, is a perennial herb native to cold, alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are hairy and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high altitude and low temperatures. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in alpine ecosystems."
