It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cousinia platyraphis is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
