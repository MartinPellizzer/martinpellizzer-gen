    "intro": "Ceratopetalorchis clavata, commonly known as the clubbed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its unique club-shaped rhizome and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose inflorescence, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
