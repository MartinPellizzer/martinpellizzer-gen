    "intro": "Cybistax millsii, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, making it a key component of coastal ecosystems. Cybistax millsii is adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal inundation, contributing to the stability of mangrove habitats."
