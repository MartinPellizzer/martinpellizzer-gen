    "intro": "Craniospermum subvillosum, commonly known as the woolly craniospermum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Craniospermum subvillosum is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers."
