    "intro": "Chamaesyce hirta var. glaberrima, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
