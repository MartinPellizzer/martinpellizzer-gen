    "intro": "Camissonia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf camissonia, is a small flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
