    "intro": "Cochemiea, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a genus of succulent cacti native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are characterized by their compact, often globular shape and are typically found growing on rocky soils. They possess thick, fleshy stems that store water, and their spines are usually short and sparse. Cochemiea species are generally cold-hardy and thrive in full sun, making them popular among desert gardeners. Their flowers, which can be yellow, white, or pink, bloom in spring and add a striking visual element to their otherwise subtle appearance."
