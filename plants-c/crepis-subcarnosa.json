    "intro": "Crepis subcarnosa, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or arctic regions. Its leaves are usually basal, with a woolly texture and a sub-carnose appearance, giving it its scientific name. The flowers are small and yellow, often clustered in a single head, and bloom in late summer."
