    "intro": "Cyrtandra rupicola, commonly known as the rock Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue-violet flowers. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and cliffs, where it forms dense mats or small shrubs. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Cyrtandra rupicola is also notable for its role in traditional Hawaiian culture and its ecological significance in stabilizing coastal soils."
