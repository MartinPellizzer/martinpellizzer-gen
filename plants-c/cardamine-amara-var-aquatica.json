    "intro": "Cardamine amara var. aquatica, commonly known as water buttercup, is a variant of the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae) characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. It typically features small, bright yellow flowers with five petals and hairy, alternate leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it can tolerate waterlogged soils. Its leaves are usually divided into three segments, and the stems are slender with a hairy texture. This variant is notable for its adaptability to aquatic environments, making it a common sight in freshwater habitats."
