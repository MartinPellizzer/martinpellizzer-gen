    "intro": "Corymbia porphyritica, commonly known as the Porphyritic Bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that often displays a reddish or pinkish hue, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, typically blooming in winter. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often have a bluish-green color with a waxy coating. The wood of Corymbia porphyritica is hard and durable, historically used by Indigenous Australians for making tools and weapons."
