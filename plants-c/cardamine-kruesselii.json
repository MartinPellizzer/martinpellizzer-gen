    "intro": "Cardamine kruesselii, commonly known as the Kruessel's watercress, is a small perennial herb native to parts of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant has trifoliate leaves with a delicate, fern-like appearance, and it produces tiny white flowers in early spring. Its stems are often reddish and covered in fine hairs, while the leaves are succulent and aromatic. This species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
