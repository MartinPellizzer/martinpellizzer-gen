    "intro": "Carex fusca var. fuliginosa, commonly known as the sooty sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its dark, almost blackish stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This variety is typically found in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant produces small, clustered flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its dense growth habit makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
