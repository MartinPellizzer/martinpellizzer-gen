    "intro": "Chaetocarpus blanchetii, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring and are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Chaetocarpus blanchetii plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
