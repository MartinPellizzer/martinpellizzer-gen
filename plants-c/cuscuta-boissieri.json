    "intro": "Cuscuta boissieri, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to regions in the Americas and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked."
