    "intro": "Cruckshanksia bustillosii, commonly known as the Malagasy moonflower, is a unique plant native to Madagascar. It is a climbing vine characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers emit a strong fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its restricted habitat and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
