    "intro": "Chaenactis pumila, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its small, white or pale blue flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a low, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
