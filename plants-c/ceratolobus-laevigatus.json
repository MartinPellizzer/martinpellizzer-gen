    "intro": "Ceratolobus laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth-barked acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by flat, leathery pods. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions. This species is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
