    "intro": "Cyperus sesquiflorus f. elongatus, commonly known as the long-flowered flatsedge, is a variant of the Cyperus genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system and spikelets that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
