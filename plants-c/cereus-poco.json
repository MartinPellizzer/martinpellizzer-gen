    "intro": "Cereus poco, commonly known as the little candle cactus, is a species native to South America. It is a small, spiny cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 15 centimeters. The plant has a cylindrical stem with areoles that bear clusters of white flowers. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces small, red fruits that are edible. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
