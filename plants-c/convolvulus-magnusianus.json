It is a perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
