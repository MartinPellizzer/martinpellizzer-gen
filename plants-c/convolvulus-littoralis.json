    "intro": "Convolvulus littoralis, commonly known as the sea bindweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a sprawling annual or perennial herb that thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with five petals. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has tendrils that help it climb or trail along the ground. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
