    "intro": "Cochlanthus socotranus, commonly known as Socotra's tree of life, is a unique plant endemic to the island of Socotra. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its thick, woody stems and distinctive, palm-like leaves. The plant is adapted to the arid and rugged environment of Socotra, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in spring, and it produces red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. This species is of significant botanical interest due to its unique morphology and its role in the island's ecosystem."
