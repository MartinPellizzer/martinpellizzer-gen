    "intro": "Cotinus cinereus, commonly known as the smoke bush, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fuzzy, pink to purple inflorescences that resemble delicate smoke, which appear in late summer. The plant has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with oval to lance-shaped leaflets. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Cotinus cinereus is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
