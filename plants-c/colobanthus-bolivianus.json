    "intro": "Colobanthus bolivianus, commonly known as the Bolivian pearlweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Colobanthus bolivianus is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
