    "intro": "Clinopodium vulgare f. unicephalum, commonly known as narrow-leaved mint, is a variant of the common wood mint. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or purple. This plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its aromatic foliage contains essential oils, making it a valuable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts. The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced number of flower heads compared to the typical form."
