    "intro": "Cerasus densiflora, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or yamabuki, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet red fruits. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Cerasus densiflora is also valued for its use in traditional Japanese culture and as a source of natural dyes."
