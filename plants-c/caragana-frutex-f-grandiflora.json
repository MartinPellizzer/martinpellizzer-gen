    "intro": "Caragana frutex f. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered shrub willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
