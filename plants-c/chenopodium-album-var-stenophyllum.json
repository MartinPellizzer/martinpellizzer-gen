    "intro": "Chenopodium album var. stenophyllum, commonly known as narrowleaf lambsquarters, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, featuring alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible, oval-shaped seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the common lambsquarters, making it easily identifiable in the field."
