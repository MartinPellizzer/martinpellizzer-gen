    "intro": "Caryodaphnopsis latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cypress, is a rare and ancient gymnosperm native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its branches. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of coniferous species. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against environmental stress. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Caryodaphnopsis latifolia is considered a species of conservation concern."
