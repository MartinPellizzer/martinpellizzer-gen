    "intro": "Croton longinervius, commonly known as the long-veined croton, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with long, prominent veins that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its attractive foliage."
