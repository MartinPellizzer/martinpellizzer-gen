    "intro": "Croton texensis, commonly known as Texas croton, is a shrub native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and parts of Louisiana. It is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage, which can range from yellow to red and orange, depending on the season and environmental conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often used in native plant gardens and landscapes."
