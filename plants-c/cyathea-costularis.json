    "intro": "Cyathea costularis, commonly known as the Costularis tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its structural support, while its fronds are often used in traditional medicine. Cyathea costularis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
