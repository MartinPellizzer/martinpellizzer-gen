    "intro": "Cerasus vulgaris var. austera, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or Prunus serrulata, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and is renowned for its clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that ripen in late summer, though they are typically not consumed by humans. Its ornamental value lies in its showy spring blossoms and its use in traditional Japanese gardens. The leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the bark is smooth and reddish-brown when young."
