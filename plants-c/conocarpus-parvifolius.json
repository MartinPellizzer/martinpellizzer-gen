    "intro": "Conocarpus parvifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, making it a key species in mangrove ecosystems. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits. This species plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
