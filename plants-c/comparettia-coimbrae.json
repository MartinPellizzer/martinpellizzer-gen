    "intro": "Comparettia coimbrae, commonly known as the Coimbra's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pouch-like flower structure that resembles a slipper, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Comparettia coimbrae is considered a conservation concern."
