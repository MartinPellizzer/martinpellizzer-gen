    "intro": "Chilopsis glutinosa, commonly known as the hummingbird flower or desert willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant produces small, green, sticky fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
