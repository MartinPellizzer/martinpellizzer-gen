    "intro": "Crataegus microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves and small, red berries that ripen in the fall. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by the characteristic fruit. Crataegus microcarpa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
