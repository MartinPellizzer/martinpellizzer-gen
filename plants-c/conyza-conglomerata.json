    "intro": "Conyza conglomerata, commonly known as the clustered aster, is an annual herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features a bushy growth habit with numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ability to spread widely. Conyza conglomerata is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
