    "intro": "Constancea, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Constancea is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
