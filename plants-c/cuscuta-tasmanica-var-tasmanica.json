    "intro": "Cuscuta tasmanica var. tasmanica, commonly known as the Tasmanian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Australia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, attaching itself with specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a sprawling, vine-like growth habit. It is often found growing on the stems of other plants in open, sunny habitats. Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable host species, making it an ecologically significant yet often overlooked component of its ecosystem."
