    "intro": "Convolvulus austroafricanus, commonly known as the African morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the bindweed family (Convolvulaceae) and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the morning. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
