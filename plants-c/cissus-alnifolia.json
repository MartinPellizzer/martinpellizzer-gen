    "intro": "Cissus alnifolia, commonly known as the rock fig or African snowball, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or trees. Cissus alnifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
