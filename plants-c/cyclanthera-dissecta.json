    "intro": "Cyclanthera dissecta, commonly known as the dissected cucumber or the feathered gourd, is a tropical climbing vine native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other gourds and cucurbits. The plant is characterized by its slender, twining stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often deeply dissected. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces small, round, green fruits that mature to a pale yellow or orange color. Cyclanthera dissecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
