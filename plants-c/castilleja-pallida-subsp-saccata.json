    "intro": "Castilleja pallida subsp. saccata, commonly known as the pale castilleja subspecies saccata, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reduced leaves and showy, often red or orange flowers. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with the roots of other plants, drawing nutrients through its haustoria. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
