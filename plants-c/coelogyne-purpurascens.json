    "intro": "Coelogyne purpurascens, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant typically produces a raceme of fragrant, long-lasting blooms during the warmer months. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. Coelogyne purpurascens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
