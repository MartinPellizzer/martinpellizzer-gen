    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale var. transsilvanicum, commonly known as the Transylvanian autumn crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Carpathian region. It features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces a distinctive, helmet-shaped corm that stores nutrients for the next growing season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging after the flowers have faded. This variant is closely related to the common autumn crocus but is distinguished by its geographic distribution and slightly different floral characteristics."
