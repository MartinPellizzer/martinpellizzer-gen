    "intro": "Culcitium tenellum, commonly known as the slender culcitium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and small, pale flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are ovate with a velvety texture, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Culcitium tenellum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
