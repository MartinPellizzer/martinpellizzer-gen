    "intro": "Calamagrostis flabellum, commonly known as the flat-leaf bulrush, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, flat leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. It produces feathery, golden-brown inflorescences in the fall, which add ornamental value to wetland landscapes. Calamagrostis flabellum plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
