    "intro": "Cypripedium schmidtianum, commonly known as Schmidt's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a unique feature among orchids. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in partial shade. Its botanical structure includes a pseudobulb and long, strap-like leaves, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
