    "intro": "Culcitium nivale, commonly known as the snow lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It thrives in cold, alpine environments where temperatures remain low and the soil is often rocky and well-drained. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the surrounding vegetation has awakened. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Culcitium nivale is considered a vulnerable species."
