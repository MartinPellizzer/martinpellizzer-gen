    "intro": "Cissus tuberosa, commonly known as the grape ivy, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, grape-like berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cissus tuberosa is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
