    "intro": "Cacalia zigzag, commonly known as the zigzag fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzagging stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as deserts and grasslands. Cacalia zigzag is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads. Its foliage is usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, helping it retain moisture in arid environments."
