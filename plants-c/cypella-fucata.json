    "intro": "Cypella fucata, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dune environments. Its unique morphology allows it to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Cypella fucata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
