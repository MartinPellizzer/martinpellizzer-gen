    "intro": "Celtis occidentalis var. georgiana, commonly known as the Southern dogwood, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light-gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
