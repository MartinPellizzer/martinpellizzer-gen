    "intro": "Campanula stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically covered in a fine layer of downy hair. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and long blooming period."
