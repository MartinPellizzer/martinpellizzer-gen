    "intro": "Calligonum tetrapterum, commonly known as the four-winged saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive four-winged fruits, which are adapted for wind dispersal. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well-suited for harsh, saline environments. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in desert and coastal areas. Calligonum tetrapterum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion."
