    "intro": "Calathea casupito, commonly known as the flame plant or zigzag plant, is a tropical species native to South America. It belongs to the Marantaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage with intricate patterns. The leaves are typically broad and have a zigzag or undulating edge, which gives the plant its common name. Its leaves exhibit a unique phenomenon called nyctinasty, where they fold at night and unfold during the day. Calathea casupito thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil for optimal growth."
