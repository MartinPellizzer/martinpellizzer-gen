    "intro": "Caesalpinia glaucophylla, commonly known as the yellow glorybower, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in dense, branched clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in warm climates. The seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread."
