    "intro": "Callitriche nubigena, commonly known as the cloud willow or floating heart, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, branching stems that float on the water's surface, with small, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale blue, and appear in clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Callitriche nubigena plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
