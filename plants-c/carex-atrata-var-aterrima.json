    "intro": "Carex atrata var. aterrima, commonly known as the black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This variety is distinguished by its deep purple to blackish foliage, which gives it its common name. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage, contributing to its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
