    "intro": "Coffea rachiformis, commonly known as the rachis coffee, is a rare and little-known species of coffee plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique, elongated fruit structure, which differs significantly from the typical coffee berries. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by its distinctive elongated, ridged fruits. It is adapted to the humid, tropical conditions of its native habitat, growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and low genetic diversity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
