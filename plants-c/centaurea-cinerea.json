    "intro": "Centaurea cinerea, commonly known as hoary centaury, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that give it a frosty appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas. Centaurea cinerea is often used in herbal medicine and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
