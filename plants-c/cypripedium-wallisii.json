    "intro": "Cypripedium wallisii, commonly known as the Wallis's slipper orchid, is a striking terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white with a contrasting lip. The plant has a pseudobulb structure and produces a single, upright stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
