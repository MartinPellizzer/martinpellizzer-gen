    "intro": "Calyptrocalyx minor, commonly known as the small calyptrocalyx, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are often covered by a calyptra, a cap-like structure that protects the developing buds. Its leaves are typically opposite and elliptical, with a smooth texture and a mild aromatic scent. Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, Calyptrocalyx minor is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
