    "intro": "Cornus stolonifera f. interior, commonly known as the interior dogwood, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the eastern United States. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant has slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread by stolons. Its foliage is typically dark green, with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens."
