    "intro": "Carex foliosissima var. foliosissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedge, is a perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, grass-green leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, upright clump. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-brown flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spikelets along the flowering stems. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swampy areas or along stream banks. This species is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
