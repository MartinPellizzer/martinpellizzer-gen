    "intro": "Crataegus tanacetifolia var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Himalayas and parts of China. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that resemble those of the common yarrow, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic and wildlife-supporting properties."
