    "intro": "Convolvulus pentaphylloides, commonly known as the five-leafed morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that produces small, pale blue to purple flowers with five petals. The plant has distinctive five-lobed leaves that are opposite on the stems, giving it its common name. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing along roadsides and in disturbed soils. The seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread easily in suitable habitats."
