It is a small, annual herb characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
