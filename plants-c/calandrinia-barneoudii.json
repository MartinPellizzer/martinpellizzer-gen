It is a herbaceous annual that produces vibrant pink to purple flowers, which open in the morning and close by midday. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with minimal water. Its botanical features include a hairy stem and capsule fruits that release tiny seeds when mature. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
