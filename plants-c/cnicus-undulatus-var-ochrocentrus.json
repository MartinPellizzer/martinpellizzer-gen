It is characterized by its hairy, yellowish-green leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. It has a low-growing habit with a mat-forming structure, making it well adapted to arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
