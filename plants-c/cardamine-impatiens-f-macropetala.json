    "intro": "Cardamine impatiens f. macropetala, commonly known as the large-flowered watercress, is a variant of the watercress species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stems. Its leaves are typically succulent and can be used in culinary applications, though it is less commonly consumed than the standard watercress. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in streams, ditches, and wet meadows."
