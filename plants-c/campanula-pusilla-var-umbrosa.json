    "intro": "Campanula pusilla var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving bellflower, is a compact perennial herb native to woodland and shaded areas of Europe. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it ideal for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and delicate flowers make it a popular choice for adding subtle beauty to shaded landscapes."
