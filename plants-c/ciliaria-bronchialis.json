    "intro": "Ciliaria bronchialis, commonly known as the lungwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins and a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Ciliaria bronchialis thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its name is derived from the resemblance of its leaves to lung tissue, reflecting its historical use in traditional medicine."
