    "intro": "Chrysanthemum trichophyllum, commonly known as the hairy chrysanthemum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant is distinguished by its hairy, glandular leaves and daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sunlight to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is less common than other chrysanthemum species."
