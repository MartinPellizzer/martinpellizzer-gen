    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 tengu, commonly known as the tangelo, is a hybrid citrus fruit resulting from the cross between a grapefruit and a mandarin orange. It is characterized by its small to medium size, thick rind, and segmented, juicy pulp that is typically sweet with a slight tartness. The plant is evergreen, with glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The fruit is often used in both culinary and medicinal applications due to its high vitamin C content and aromatic properties."
