It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white to grayish down, which helps to retain moisture and protect against harsh weather. Callianthemum rutifolium is a perennial species that is often found in meadows and scree slopes at high elevations."
