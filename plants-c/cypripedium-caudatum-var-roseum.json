    "intro": "Cypripedium caudatum var. roseum, commonly known as the rose-flowered cinnamon spathophyll, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, with a distinctive cinnamon-brown lip. The plant typically grows in cool, moist habitats, often in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces a single, erect flowering stem each year. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists."
