    "intro": "Castilla ulei f. lecithogalacta, commonly known as the lecithogalacta form of the Chilean wineberry, is a variant of the Castilla ulei species native to South America. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, dark red berries. The plant has thick, leathery leaves that are often coated with a waxy layer, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces flowers that are typically pale green or yellow, and the fruit is edible, though it has a tart flavor. This form is notable for its unique leaf structure and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
