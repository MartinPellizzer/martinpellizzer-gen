    "intro": "Centaurea villarsii, commonly known as the Villars' cornflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, and it produces slender, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. Centaurea villarsii is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands at high altitudes."
