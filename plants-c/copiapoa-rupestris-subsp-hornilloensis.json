It is a small, columnar cactus with a short, thick stem and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It has a shallow root system adapted to the arid environment, allowing it to absorb moisture from the surface. This subspecies is noted for its slow growth and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
