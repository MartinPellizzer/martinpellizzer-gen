    "intro": "Cyathea balakrishnanii, commonly known as the Balakrishnan's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of India and Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a dense network, helping it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique feature makes it a subject of interest in both botanical research and ecological studies."
