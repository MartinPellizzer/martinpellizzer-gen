    "intro": "Colutea arborescens var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine broomrape, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies in high-altitude environments."
