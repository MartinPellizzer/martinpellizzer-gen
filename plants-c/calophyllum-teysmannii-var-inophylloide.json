    "intro": "Calophyllum teysmannii var. inophylloide, commonly known as the red sandalwood or inophylloide variant, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and long, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing aromatic seeds. It is valued for its durable, dark reddish wood, which has been used historically in furniture and carving. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
