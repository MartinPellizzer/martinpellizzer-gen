    "intro": "Caelestium tianschanicum, commonly known as the Tian Shan skyflower, is a rare alpine plant native to the Tianshan Mountains in Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue and violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and leaves adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
