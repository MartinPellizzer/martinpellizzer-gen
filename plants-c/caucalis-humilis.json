    "intro": "Caucalis humilis, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Caucalis humilis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
