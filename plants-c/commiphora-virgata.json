    "intro": "Commiphora virgata, commonly known as the African myrrh, is a small evergreen tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain a single seed. Commiphora virgata is notable for its ability to exude a resinous sap, which has been traditionally used for medicinal and aromatic purposes. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in its native range."
