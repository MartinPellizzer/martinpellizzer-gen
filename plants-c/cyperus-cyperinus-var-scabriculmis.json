    "intro": "Cyperus cyperinus var. scabriculmis, commonly known as the roughleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like stems that are often found in wetland or marshy environments. The leaves are narrow, linear, and have a rough, textured surface, giving it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in late summer or early autumn. This plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
