    "intro": "Chrysocoma heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf chrysocoma, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in the Cape Floristic Region. The plant features alternate, simple, and often hairy leaves that vary in shape and size along the stem. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
