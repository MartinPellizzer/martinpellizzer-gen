    "intro": "Cissus bicolor, commonly known as the snow vine, is a climbing plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive waxy, translucent leaves that resemble small pieces of glass, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. Cissus bicolor thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
