    "intro": "Carex gibba, commonly known as the spurred sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering spikes produce small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Carex gibba is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
