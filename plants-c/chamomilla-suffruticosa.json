    "intro": "Chamomilla suffruticosa, commonly known as wild chamomile, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, featuring woody stems and hairy leaves that are alternate and oval in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with white petals, which bloom in the summer months. Its aromatic properties are attributed to the presence of compounds like bisabolol and chamazulene. Chamomilla suffruticosa is often used in traditional medicine for its calming and anti-inflammatory effects."
