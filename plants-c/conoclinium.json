    "intro": "Conoclinium, commonly known as honeyweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. They typically grow in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Conoclinium species often have opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produce small, winged seeds. The flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, making them valuable in ecological and ornamental gardening."
