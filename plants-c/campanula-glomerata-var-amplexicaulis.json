It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features a basal rosette of broad, hairy leaves that often wrap around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
