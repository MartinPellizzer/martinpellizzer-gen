    "intro": "Cuscuta africana var. capensis, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to Africa and is often found growing on crops such as maize and beans. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural plants."
