    "intro": "Cotoneaster nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal, India, and Bhutan. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The plant features small, oval leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the spring. Its fruit is a small, red berry that matures in the autumn, providing food for birds and other wildlife. Cotoneaster nepalensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and adaptability."
