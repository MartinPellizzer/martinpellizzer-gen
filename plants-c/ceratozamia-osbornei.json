    "intro": "Ceratozamia osbornei, commonly known as the Osborne's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Ceratozamia osbornei is known for its slow growth and is considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection. Its botanical features make it a unique subject of study in the field of plant biology and conservation."
