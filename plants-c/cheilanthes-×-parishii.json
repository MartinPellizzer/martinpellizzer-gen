    "intro": "Cheilanthes \u00d7 parishii, commonly known as the hybrid rock fern, is a member of the Pteridaceae family and is native to regions of southern Africa. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, mat-forming rhizomes. The plant produces small, orbicular to ovate leaves that are typically covered with a layer of fine, silky hairs. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the leaves, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and dry, well-drained soils."
