    "intro": "Coffea farafanganensis, commonly known as the Farafanga coffee, is a rare and lesser-known species of coffee native to the tropical regions of West Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped red berries that contain two seeds, which are used to produce coffee beans. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with a slightly serrated edge, and it produces white flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited cultivation and habitat, Coffea farafanganensis is considered a unique but underexplored species in the coffee family."
