    "intro": "Cheilanthes brausei, commonly known as the Brause's rockcap, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Cheilanthes brausei is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that thrives in well-drained soils."
