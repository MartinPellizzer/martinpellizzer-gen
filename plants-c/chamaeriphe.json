It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to southern Africa. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. They produce edible fruits that are often consumed by both humans and animals. Chamaeriphe species are adapted to arid and rocky environments, making them resilient to harsh conditions."
