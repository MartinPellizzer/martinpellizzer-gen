    "intro": "Clematopsis oliveri, commonly known as the Oliver's clematopsis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody stems and showy flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for shaded garden landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
