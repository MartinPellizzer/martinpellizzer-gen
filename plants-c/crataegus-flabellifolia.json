    "intro": "Crataegus flabellifolia, commonly known as the flabellifera hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a distinctive, fan-like appearance. The plant produces white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a fragrant scent, and it is often found in moist woodlands and streamside habitats. Crataegus flabellifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
