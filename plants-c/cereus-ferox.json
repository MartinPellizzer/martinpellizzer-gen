    "intro": "Cereus ferox, commonly known as the death skull cactus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive, spiny stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that are fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its stems are covered in sharp, backward-pointing spines, which provide protection from herbivores. Cereus ferox is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem."
