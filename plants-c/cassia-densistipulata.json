    "intro": "Cassia densistipulata, commonly known as the dense-stipule cassia, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with densely arranged stipules, which are small leaf-like structures at the base of the leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and are often used in traditional medicine. Cassia densistipulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has ecological significance in its native habitats."
