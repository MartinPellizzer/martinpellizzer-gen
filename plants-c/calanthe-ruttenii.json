    "intro": "Calanthe ruttenii, commonly known as the Rutten's calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its tall, upright inflorescence bearing clusters of showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in the wild."
