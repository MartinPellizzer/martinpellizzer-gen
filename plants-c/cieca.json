    "intro": "Cieca, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its haunting appearance. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Its growth is slow and requires a humid, shaded environment to thrive. Due to its rarity and delicate nature, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
