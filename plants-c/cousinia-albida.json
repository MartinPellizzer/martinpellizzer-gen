    "intro": "Cousinia albida, commonly known as the white cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to harsh environments, with succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Cousinia albida is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
