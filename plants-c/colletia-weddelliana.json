    "intro": "Colletia weddelliana, commonly known as the Weddell's cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the dry season, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions."
