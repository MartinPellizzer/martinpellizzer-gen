    "intro": "Campanula marchesettii var. calisii, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions."
