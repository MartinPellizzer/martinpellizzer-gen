    "intro": "Coaxana bambusioides, commonly known as the bamboo fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that resemble bamboo in appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous structure allows it to spread and form dense clusters, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The leaves are usually bright green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its aesthetic appeal."
