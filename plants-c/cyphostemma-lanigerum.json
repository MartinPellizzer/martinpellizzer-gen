    "intro": "Cyphostemma lanigerum, commonly known as the desert milkvine, is a woody climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, vine-like stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by yellowish-orange berries. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing along rocky outcrops or in scrublands. Cyphostemma lanigerum is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
