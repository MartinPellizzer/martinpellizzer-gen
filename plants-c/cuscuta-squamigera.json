    "intro": "Cuscuta squamigera, commonly known as the golden dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow-orange flowers and has a unique life cycle that begins with seed germination, followed by attachment to a host via specialized structures called haustoria. The plant spreads by releasing seeds that can remain viable for many years, allowing it to colonize new hosts. It is often found in agricultural fields and disturbed areas, where it can cause significant damage to crops. Its rapid growth and lack of photosynthetic ability make it a challenging weed to control."
