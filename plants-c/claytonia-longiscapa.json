It produces delicate, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, appearing in early spring. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Claytonia longiscapa is often found in meadows and forest edges, where it contributes to early-season floral diversity."
