    "intro": "Cerastium macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Cerastium macrocalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden settings for its delicate foliage and flowering habit."
