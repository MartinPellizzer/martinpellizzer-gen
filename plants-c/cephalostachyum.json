    "intro": "Cephalostachyum, commonly known as the golden spike grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their dense, spike-like inflorescences that often display vibrant yellow or golden hues. Cephalostachyum species typically grow as perennial herbs, often forming clumps or tussocks. Their botanical features make them valuable in both ornamental horticulture and ecological restoration projects."
