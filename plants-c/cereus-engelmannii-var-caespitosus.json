    "intro": "Cereus engelmannii var. caespitosus, commonly known as the Englemann's cactus or the desert night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that grow in dense clusters, forming a compact, shrub-like structure. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Its adaptations to arid environments include reduced leaf surface and a thick, waxy cuticle to minimize water loss."
