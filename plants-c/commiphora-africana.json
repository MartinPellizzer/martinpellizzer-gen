    "intro": "Commiphora africana, commonly known as African myrrh, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, aromatic resinous gum, which is the source of its common name. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The resin has been traditionally used for its medicinal and aromatic properties."
