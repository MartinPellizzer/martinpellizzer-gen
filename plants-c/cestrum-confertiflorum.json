    "intro": "Cestrum confertiflorum, commonly known as the clustered trumpetflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant is a shrub or small tree with opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Cestrum confertiflorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
