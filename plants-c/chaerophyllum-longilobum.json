    "intro": "Chaerophyllum longilobum, commonly known as the long-lobed hedge parsley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of fern-like, pinnately lobed leaves that are often hairy and have a strong aromatic scent. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
