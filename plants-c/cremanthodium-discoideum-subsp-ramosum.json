    "intro": "Cremanthodium discoideum subsp. ramosum, commonly known as the branched goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces delicate, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The subspecies is characterized by its branched stems, which distinguish it from other members of the genus."
