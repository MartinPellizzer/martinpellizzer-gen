    "intro": "Crotalaria prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate crownflower, is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features sprawling, prostrate stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typical of the Fabaceae (legume) family. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often pubescent, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Crotalaria prostrata is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is sometimes used in phytoremediation due to its tolerance of heavy metals."
