    "intro": "Cyanea submuricata, commonly known as the rough-hairy sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically hairy and have a rough texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its saline environment. This species thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes or tidal zones. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
