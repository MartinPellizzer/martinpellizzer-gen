It features a slender, upright stem covered in soft, grayish-green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly aromatic scent when crushed. Clarionea fonki is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
