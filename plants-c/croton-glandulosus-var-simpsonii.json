It is characterized by its vibrant, often multicolored foliage, with leaves that can range from green to red, orange, and even purple. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
