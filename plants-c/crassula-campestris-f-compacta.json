    "intro": "Crassula campestris f. compacta, commonly known as the Dwarf Crassula or Compact Crassula, is a compact, succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a houseplant. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
