    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 thibautianum, commonly known as the Thibaut's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a pseudobulb structure and produces a single, elongated leaf, which is typical of many orchid species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts, though it is also threatened by habitat loss."
