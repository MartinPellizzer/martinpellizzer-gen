    "intro": "Cylindrokelupha yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan cycad, is a rare and ancient gymnosperm native to China. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
