    "intro": "Cypripedium tibeticum subsp. ludlowii, commonly known as the Ludlow's yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Tibet and Nepal. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in high-altitude alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, and it produces a single, upright stem that bears the ornate flower. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this subspecies is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
