    "intro": "Cyrtandra elatostemoides, commonly known as the Hawaiian false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to invasive species, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
