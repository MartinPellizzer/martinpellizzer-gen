It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and hairy stems, which are typical features of the Crotalaria genus. The plant is an annual herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas. Its seed pods split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting pollinators."
