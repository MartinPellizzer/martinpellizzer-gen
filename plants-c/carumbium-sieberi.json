    "intro": "Carumbium sieberi, commonly known as the Sieber's carumbium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, umbellate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, resembling those of other members of its family. Carumbium sieberi is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
