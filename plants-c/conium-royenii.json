    "intro": "Conium royenii, commonly known as the Royal hemlock, is a rare and striking plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery, compound leaves that resemble those of hemlock. The plant produces small, white flowers in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. Native to specific regions in Europe, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in cultivation despite its ornamental appeal."
