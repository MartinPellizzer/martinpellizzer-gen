    "intro": "Cephalophyllum diminutum, commonly known as the dwarf headplant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine white hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
