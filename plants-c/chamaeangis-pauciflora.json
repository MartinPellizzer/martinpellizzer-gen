    "intro": "Chamaeangis pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
