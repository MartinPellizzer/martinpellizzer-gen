    "intro": "Cleidion megistophyllum, commonly known as the giant sycamore, is a large tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are grouped in clusters, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rough texture that aids in identification. This species is known for its rapid growth and is often used in reforestation efforts due to its ecological benefits."
