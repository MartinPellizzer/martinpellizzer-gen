    "intro": "Croomia, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It features a distinctive, arching foliage with serrated, lance-shaped leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically found on the lower part of the leaves. Croomia thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
