    "intro": "Colutea nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal, India, and Bhutan. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its seeds are encased in a pod and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution in high-altitude environments. Colutea nepalensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local herbal medicine."
