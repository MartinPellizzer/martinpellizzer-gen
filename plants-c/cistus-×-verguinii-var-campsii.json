    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 verguinii var. campsii, commonly known as the Corsican rockrose, is a hybrid shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal and dry garden environments. Its leaves are small, leathery, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
