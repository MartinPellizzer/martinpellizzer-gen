    "intro": "Ctenitis anyuanensis, commonly known as the Anyuan shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a short, creeping rhizome and tightly packed, bi-lobed leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
