It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, often fragrant bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
