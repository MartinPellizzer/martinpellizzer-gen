It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers arranged in a dense, spherical head. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Calocephalus skeatsianus is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it adapts to harsh environmental conditions."
