    "intro": "Croton serpyllifolius, commonly known as silverleaf croton, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its glossy, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
