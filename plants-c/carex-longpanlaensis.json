    "intro": "Carex longpanlaensis, commonly known as the longpanlaensis sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to specific regions in China and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the sedge family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streams. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
