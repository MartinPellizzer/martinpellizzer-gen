It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early spring, which are arranged in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in temperate regions where it often grows in dense mats."
