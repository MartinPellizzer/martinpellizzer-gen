    "intro": "Campylocercum paucifolium, commonly known as the few-leaved campylocercum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
