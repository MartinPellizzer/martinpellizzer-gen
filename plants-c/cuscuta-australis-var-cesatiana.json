    "intro": "Cuscuta australis var. cesatiana, commonly known as the Australian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive appearance with its thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to Australia and is often found growing on a variety of host species, including shrubs and trees. Its life cycle involves attaching to the host through specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. This species plays a role in both ecological interactions and can sometimes be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
