    "intro": "Carex schaffneri, commonly known as Schaffner's sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers. Native to North America, particularly in the eastern United States, it thrives in moist to wet environments such as swamps and marshes. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in wetland habitats. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
