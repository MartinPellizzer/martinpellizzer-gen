    "intro": "Centaurea cuneifolia subsp. sublanata, commonly known as the narrowleaf knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and striking purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The subspecies sublanata differs from the typical form by having a more densely hairy stem and leaves, giving it a woolly appearance. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. This plant is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
