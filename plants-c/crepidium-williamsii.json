    "intro": "Crepidium williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands and grasslands of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a spike of small, greenish-white flowers with a distinct, three-lobed lip. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
