    "intro": "Climacoptera khalisica, commonly known as the mountain mistplant, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky crevices or on steep slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Climacoptera khalisica is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat degradation."
