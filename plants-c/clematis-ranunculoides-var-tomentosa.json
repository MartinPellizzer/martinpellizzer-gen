    "intro": "Clematis ranunculoides var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a distinctive hairy, woolly texture on its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. It thrives in partial to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its vigorous growth habit makes it an excellent choice for covering fences or trellises in gardens."
