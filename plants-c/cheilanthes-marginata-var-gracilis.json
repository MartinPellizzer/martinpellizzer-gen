    "intro": "Cheilanthes marginata var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender cliff brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries like Namibia and South Africa. This fern is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and small, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in crevices. Due to its hardy nature and ability to survive in harsh environments, it is an important component of the local flora in its native habitat."
