    "intro": "Colchicum umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It produces striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from August to September. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and grows from a bulb-like structure called a corm. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky slopes. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
