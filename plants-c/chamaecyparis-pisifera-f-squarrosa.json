    "intro": "Chamaecyparis pisifera f. squarrosa, commonly known as the Japanese white cedar with fringed foliage, is a cultivar of the Chamaecyparis genus. It is characterized by its unique, feathery appearance, with juvenile foliage that forms dense, fluffy tufts along the branches. This form is a natural mutation of the parent species, resulting in a more compact and ornamental growth habit. The plant is evergreen, featuring scale-like leaves that turn a silvery-blue hue as they mature. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
