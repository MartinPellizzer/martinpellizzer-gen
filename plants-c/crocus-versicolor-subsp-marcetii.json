    "intro": "Crocus versicolor subsp. marcetii, commonly known as the Alaskan crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, often with a distinctive purple or reddish hue at the base. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves emerge, and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its bulbs are relatively small and store nutrients to support growth in harsh conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
