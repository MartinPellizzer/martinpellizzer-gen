    "intro": "Coryanthes trifoliata, commonly known as the trileaf pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hooded pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap and digest insects. The plant's three-lobed leaves give it its common name, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ecological role in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically green or yellow, and are pollinated by specific insect species."
