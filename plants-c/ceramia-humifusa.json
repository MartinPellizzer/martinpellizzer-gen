    "intro": "Ceramia humifusa, commonly known as the groundsel or sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are usually hairy and succulent, helping to reduce water loss. Ceramia humifusa is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some traditional herbal remedies."
