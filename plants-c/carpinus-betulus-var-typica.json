    "intro": "Carpinus betulus var. typica, commonly known as European hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, smooth, dark grey bark and its distinctive, four-angled branches. The leaves are oval-shaped, with finely serrated margins, and turn yellow in autumn. It produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits. This species is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
