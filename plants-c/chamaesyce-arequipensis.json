    "intro": "Chamaesyce arequipensis, commonly known as the Arequipa spurge, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Peru. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique adaptations, it is well-suited to the harsh conditions of the Andean highlands."
