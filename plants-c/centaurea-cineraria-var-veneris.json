    "intro": "Centaurea cineraria var. veneris, commonly known as the Spanish blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems covered in fine, grayish-white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers arranged in dense, circular heads, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a fuzzy texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in dry garden settings due to its drought tolerance."
