It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring. Its tuberous roots are an important characteristic, contributing to its survival through periods of dormancy. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
