    "intro": "Cryophytum pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf frost plant, is a small, herbaceous species native to the cold regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers during the short growing season. It is adapted to low temperatures and can survive in snow-covered conditions for much of the year. Its botanical features make it a unique example of cryophytic flora."
