It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and dense clusters of spikelets at the ends of its stems. Native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows in shaded to semi-shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets."
