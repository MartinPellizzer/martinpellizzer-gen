    "intro": "Crinum mauritianum, commonly known as the Madagascar lily, is a striking herbaceous plant native to Madagascar. It features large, showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, often with a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves and can grow up to 2 meters tall, making it a prominent feature in its natural habitat. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive nature and ecological impact."
