    "intro": "Campanopsis hederacea, commonly known as the ivy bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, waxy leaves that resemble those of ivy. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Campanopsis hederacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover."
