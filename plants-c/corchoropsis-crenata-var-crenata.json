    "intro": "Corchoropsis crenata var. crenata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cottonwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters, featuring slender, often branching stems with a rough, bark-like surface. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate to elliptical in shape, with serrated margins and a dull green upper surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This plant is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
