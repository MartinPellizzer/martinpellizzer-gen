It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. It has finely divided leaves and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Conyza candida is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
