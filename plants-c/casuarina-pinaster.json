It is a tall, evergreen tree with needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are clustered in spike-like structures, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. Casuarina pinaster is known for its ability to thrive in coastal and sandy soils, making it a common species in maritime environments. Its root system helps stabilize dunes and prevent erosion, contributing to its ecological significance."
