    "intro": "Cardamomum palludosum, commonly known as the swamp cardamom, is a perennial herb native to wet tropical regions. It features elongated, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by three-lobed berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or marshy areas. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
