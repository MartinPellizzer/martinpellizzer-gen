It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant blue petals, which range from pale sky blue to deep cobalt.

Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, Calchas coeruleus is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists alike."
