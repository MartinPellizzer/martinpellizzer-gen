    "intro": "Ceropteris decomposita, commonly known as the decomposed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of its fronds. Ceropteris decomposita plays a role in nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems due to its rapid decomposition and growth patterns."
