    "intro": "Cylicodaphne macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf sago palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a cycad-like appearance, with a thick, fibrous trunk and a crown of pinnate leaves. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value. Cylicodaphne macrophylla is often cultivated as a decorative plant in warm climates due to its striking foliage and slow growth rate."
