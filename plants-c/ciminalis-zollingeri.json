    "intro": "Ciminalis zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's ciminalis, is a rare and little-studied plant species native to specific high-altitude regions. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, moist climate to thrive. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes."
