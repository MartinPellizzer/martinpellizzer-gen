    "intro": "Coronilla orientalis subsp. balansae, commonly known as the Balkan vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor environments."
