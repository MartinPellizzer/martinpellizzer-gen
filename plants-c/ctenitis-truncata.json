    "intro": "Ctenitis truncata, commonly known as the cut-leaf rockmoss, is a rare and unique fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed fronds that give it a rugged, almost sculptural appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky or wooded areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed forest ecosystems."
