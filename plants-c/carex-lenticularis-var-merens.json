    "intro": "Carex lenticularis var. merens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. This variety thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and pond edges, and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in wetland habitats."
