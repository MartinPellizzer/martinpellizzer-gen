    "intro": "Calyptraria insignis, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Caloplacaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a dense, flat layer on rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is pale yellow to orange in color, and it contains various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role. It is often found on limestone and sandstone substrates, thriving in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure. This lichen is an important indicator species for environmental conditions and plays a role in soil formation and nutrient cycling."
