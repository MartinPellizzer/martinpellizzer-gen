It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The showy purple to violet flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
