    "intro": "Cephalocereus chrysacanthus, commonly known as the golden candelabra cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinct crown of spines and yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant features a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters at the top of the plant, adding a striking visual element. This species is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
