    "intro": "Caprifolium italicum, commonly known as the Italian honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated edge, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland edges and along streambanks, where it contributes to the ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators. Caprifolium italicum is also valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
