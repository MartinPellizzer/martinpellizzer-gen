    "intro": "Cerasus boissieri, commonly known as the Boissier cherry, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Prunus genus and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
