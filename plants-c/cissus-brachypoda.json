    "intro": "Cissus brachypoda, commonly known as the rock fig or African snowball, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, giving it its common name. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature. Cissus brachypoda is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils."
