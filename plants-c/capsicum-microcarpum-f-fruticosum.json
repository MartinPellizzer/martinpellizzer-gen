    "intro": "Capsicum microcarpum f. fruticosum, commonly known as the dwarf chili pepper, is a botanical variant of the common capsicum species. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, often red or orange fruits. The plant typically thrives in warm, sunny climates and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces flowers that transition into the distinctive pepper fruits. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild to spicy flavor, making it suitable for both culinary and decorative purposes."
