    "intro": "Cerasus serrulata var. florepleno, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry or Japanese doubleflowering cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, double blooms of white or pink petals that appear in early spring, giving it a particularly ornamental appearance. The plant has ovate to elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. It produces small, red drupes that ripen in late summer, though these are not typically harvested for consumption. This variety is prized in horticulture for its showy flowers and is often used in ornamental gardens and as a specimen plant."
