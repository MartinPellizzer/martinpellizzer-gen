    "intro": "Corallorhiza striata var. vreelandii, commonly known as the Vreeland's coralroot, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph. This plant relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients, often forming symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a rosette of fleshy, reddish-brown leaves and produces showy, red or orange flowers. The species is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest habitats. Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many parts of its range."
