    "intro": "Crepidium taylorii, commonly known as Taylor's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a short, erect stem and a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces a single, delicate flower with a greenish-yellow lip and a faintly colored dorsal sepal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
