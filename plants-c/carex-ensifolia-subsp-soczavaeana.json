    "intro": "Carex ensifolia subsp. soczavaeana, commonly known as the Soczavaean sedge, is a perennial plant native to parts of Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats, such as marshes and along stream edges. It produces small, clustered spikes of flowers that are typically green or brown in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in suitable environments."
