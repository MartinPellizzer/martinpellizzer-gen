It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments."
