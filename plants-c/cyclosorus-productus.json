It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four parts, forming a star-like shape. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight and nutrients. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into fruiting bodies containing minute seeds. Cyclosorus productus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic animals."
