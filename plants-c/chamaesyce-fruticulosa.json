    "intro": "Chamaesyce fruticulosa, commonly known as the prickly cholla, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that branch out into clusters. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually reduced to small scales, and the plant is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. Chamaesyce fruticulosa is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals."
