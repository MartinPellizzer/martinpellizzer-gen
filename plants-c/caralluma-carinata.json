    "intro": "Caralluma carinata, commonly known as the spineless night beauty, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming at night. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Caralluma carinata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to harsh conditions."
