    "intro": "Cynanchum membranaceum, commonly known as the Chinese milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to China and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive seed pods that split open when mature. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and mountainous regions. Cynanchum membranaceum is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
