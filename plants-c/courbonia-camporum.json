    "intro": "Courbonia camporum, commonly known as the African wild cherry, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It has smooth, dark grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that turn red when mature. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland and forested areas."
