    "intro": "Caprifolium hortense, commonly known as the garden honeysuckle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caprifoliaceae family. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often appearing in clusters. The plant typically grows as a deciduous shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with opposite, simple, ovate leaves. Its berries are small, red, and edible, though not as commonly consumed as those of other honeysuckle species. Caprifolium hortense thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
