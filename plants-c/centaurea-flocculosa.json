    "intro": "Centaurea flocculosa, commonly known as the woolly centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, fluffy, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Centaurea flocculosa is a perennial herb that produces small, seed-like fruits called achenes."
