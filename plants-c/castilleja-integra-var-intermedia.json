    "intro": "Castilleja integra var. intermedia, commonly known as the Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on the roots of other plants for some of its nutrients. It is native to the western United States and parts of Canada, typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant produces vibrant red to orange flowers in clusters, which are adapted for pollination by hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and its stems are often green and leafless. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems as both a host for insects and a part of the plant community."
