    "intro": "Carex filiformis var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the soft-haired sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate regions. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
