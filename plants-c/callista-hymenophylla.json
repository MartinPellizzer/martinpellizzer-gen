    "intro": "Callista hymenophylla, commonly known as the lace fern, is a delicate and intricate epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. Its small, clustered spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its unique structure and beauty, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in greenhouses and terrariums."
