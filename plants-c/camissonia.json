    "intro": "Camissonia, commonly known as the fairy lantern or ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Camissoniaceae. These plants are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions of western North America, where they thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Camissonia species are characterized by their small, showy flowers that often have a striking color contrast between their petals and sepals. The plants are generally low-growing, with succulent leaves that help them conserve water in their harsh environments. Due to their unique appearance and limited distribution, Camissonia species are of interest to botanists and conservationists."
