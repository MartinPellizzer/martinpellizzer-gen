    "intro": "Coniogramme serrulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds. The plant has delicate, finely serrated leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns. Coniogramme serrulata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
