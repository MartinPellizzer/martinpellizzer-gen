    "intro": "Cochlidium pusillum, commonly known as the small cochlid, is a small, terrestrial gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Cochlididae. It is typically found in moist, forested environments, where it thrives in leaf litter and under rocks. The shell of Cochlidium pusillum is slender and conical, with a smooth surface and a spiral pattern that becomes more pronounced as the shell matures. Its diet consists mainly of decaying plant matter, contributing to the decomposition process in its habitat. This species plays a minor but important role in the ecological balance of its environment."
