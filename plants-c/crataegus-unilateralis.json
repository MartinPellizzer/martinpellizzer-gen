    "intro": "Crataegus unilateralis, commonly known as the single-sided hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, asymmetrical growth pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant produces white or pink flowers in spring, followed by red berries in the fall. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges. Crataegus unilateralis is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
