It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, spiny, orange-red fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forests or along stream banks. The leaves and flowers are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
