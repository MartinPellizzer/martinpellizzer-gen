    "intro": "Chenopodium watsonii f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf goosefoot, is a flowering plant species native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its succulent stems and leaves help it retain water, adapting it to harsh, drought-prone habitats. This variety is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to other forms of Chenopodium watsonii."
