    "intro": "Clerodendrum phyllomega var. myrmecophilum, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique tropical shrub characterized by its striking, velvety leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers. This variety is notable for its symbiotic relationship with certain ant species, which reside in the plant's hollow stems, providing protection in exchange for shelter and food. The plant's morphology includes opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, enhancing its aesthetic appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological interactions and adaptability to specific environmental conditions."
