    "intro": "Clematis aristata var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough-stemmed clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features distinctive, palmate leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and its flowers are typically white to pale blue, appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in partial to full sun and requires well-drained soil, making it a versatile choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, ornamental vine."
