    "intro": "Commiphora mossamedensis, commonly known as the Somali myrrh tree, is a small, deciduous tree native to the Horn of Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a fragrant resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and incense. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in its native range."
