    "intro": "Cerastium viscosum var. apetalum, commonly known as sticky mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, hairy leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps deter herbivores. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
