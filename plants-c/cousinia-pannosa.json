    "intro": "Cousinia pannosa, commonly known as the silky cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in the spring and early summer. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads. Cousinia pannosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
