    "intro": "Cucumis prophetarum subsp. prophetarum, commonly known as the prophet's cucumber, is a rare and ancient species of cucumber native to the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, elongated fruits with a pale green skin and a mild, slightly sweet flavor. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, a feature common in many cucurbit species. The subspecies is notable for its historical significance in ancient agriculture and its use in traditional medicine."
