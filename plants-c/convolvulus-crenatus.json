    "intro": "Convolvulus crenatus, commonly known as the curly bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves with scalloped edges. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring and summer. It is a member of the Bindweed family (Convolvulaceae) and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Due to its aggressive spreading nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings."
