It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Cineraria glauca is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
