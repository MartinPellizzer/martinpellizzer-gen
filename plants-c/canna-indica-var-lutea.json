    "intro": "Canna indica var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow canna, is a striking ornamental plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, often with a deep green color and a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, tropical-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in clusters at the top of tall, sturdy stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for water gardens and tropical landscapes. Canna indica var. lutea is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
