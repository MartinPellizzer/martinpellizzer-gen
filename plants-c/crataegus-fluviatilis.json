It typically grows along riverbanks and moist soils, adapting well to aquatic environments. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it produces thorny branches. Crataegus fluviatilis is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
