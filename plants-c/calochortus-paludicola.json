    "intro": "Calochortus paludicola, commonly known as the marsh marigold, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of California. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to thrive in moist or aquatic environments. Calochortus paludicola is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to wetland habitats and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
