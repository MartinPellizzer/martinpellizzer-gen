    "intro": "Campyloneurum albopunctatissimum, commonly known as the white-spotted rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on rocky outcrops or in dense tropical forests. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of white, sporangial dots. Its reproductive structures are clustered along the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
