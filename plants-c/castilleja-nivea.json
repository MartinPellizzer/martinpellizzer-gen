    "intro": "Castilleja nivea, commonly known as the snow ghostshroud, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and shrubs. Its slender, branching stems are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Castilleja nivea is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
