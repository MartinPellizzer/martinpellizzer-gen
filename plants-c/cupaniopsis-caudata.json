It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and sandy environments. Cupaniopsis caudata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive form."
