    "intro": "Cynanchum subcoriaceum, commonly known as the rough milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are typically arranged in racemes. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Cynanchum subcoriaceum is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
