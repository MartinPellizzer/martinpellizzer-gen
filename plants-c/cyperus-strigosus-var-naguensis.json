It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, clustered spikes of flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color. This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
