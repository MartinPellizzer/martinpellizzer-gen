    "intro": "Cirsium morinifolium, commonly known as the Morin's thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss, and its flowers are visited by various pollinators. Cirsium morinifolium is often found in alpine meadows and is part of the Asteraceae family."
