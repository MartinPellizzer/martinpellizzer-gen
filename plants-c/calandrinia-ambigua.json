    "intro": "Calandrinia ambigua, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb that produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to red. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Calandrinia ambigua is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability."
