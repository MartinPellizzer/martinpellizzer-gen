    "intro": "Chlorophytum miserum, commonly known as the snake plant, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with distinct white or yellow stripes. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its leaves are fibrous and contain a high concentration of starch, which contributes to its resilience. Chlorophytum miserum is also noted for its air-purifying properties, as it can absorb toxins from the air."
