    "intro": "Cirsium sublaniflorum, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a robust stem that is often covered in dense, white to grayish hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces large, spiny leaves with a rough, serrated margin, and its flowers are typically purple or pink, arranged in a composite head. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Cirsium sublaniflorum is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
