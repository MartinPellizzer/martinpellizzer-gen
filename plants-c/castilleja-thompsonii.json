    "intro": "Castilleja thompsonii, commonly known as Thompson's Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, brush-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb nutrients from host plants, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
