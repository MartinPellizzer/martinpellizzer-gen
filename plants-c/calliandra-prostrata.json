    "intro": "Calliandra prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate calliandra, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features sprawling, low-growing stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which are accompanied by feathery, bipinnate leaves. It is well adapted to dry and arid conditions, making it a resilient species in challenging environments. Its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen make it useful in ecological restoration projects."
