    "intro": "Carex emmonsii, commonly known as Emmons' sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, often in open meadows or along stream banks. Emmons' sedge is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
