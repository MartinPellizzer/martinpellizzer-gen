    "intro": "Caobangia, commonly known as the Vietnamese ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of northern Vietnam. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, thriving in shaded, humid environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, a feature common among epiphytic orchids. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Caobangia is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
