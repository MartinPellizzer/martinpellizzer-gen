    "intro": "Copiapoa dealbata f. gigantea, commonly known as the giant Copiapoa, is a columnar cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It features a tall, slender stem with a smooth, pale green surface that becomes more woolly with age. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is a slow-growing species that requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its striking appearance and rarity, it is often cultivated by cactus enthusiasts."
