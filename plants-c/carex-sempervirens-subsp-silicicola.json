    "intro": "Carex sempervirens subsp. silicicola, commonly known as the silicicola sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. The silicicola sedge is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
