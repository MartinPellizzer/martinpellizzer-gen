    "intro": "Crepidomanes ruwenzoriense, commonly known as the Ruwenzori stonecress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Rwenzori Mountains in East Africa. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately compound leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Crepidomanes ruwenzoriense is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
