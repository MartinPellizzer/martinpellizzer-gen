    "intro": "Caesalpinia trothaei, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces bright yellow to orange inflorescences, which are typical of the Caesalpinia genus. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine. The velvet tamarind is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
