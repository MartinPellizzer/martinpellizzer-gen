    "intro": "Chenopodium hircinum subf. angustatum, commonly known as narrowleaf goosefoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its slender, angular stems and alternate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are enclosed in dry, three-angled capsules. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
