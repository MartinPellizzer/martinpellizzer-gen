It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its flowers are typically white or pink, with five petals. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are often hairy, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. This variety is distinguished by its ovate leaf shape, which sets it apart from other varieties of Circaea."
