It features a slender trunk and a crown of feathery leaves that are typically shorter than those of the standard coconut palm. The plant produces small, rounded nuts that are often used in ornamental gardening due to their aesthetic appeal. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in coastal and tropical regions."
