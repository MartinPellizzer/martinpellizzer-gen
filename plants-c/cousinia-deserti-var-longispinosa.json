    "intro": "Cousinia deserti var. longispinosa, commonly known as the long-spined desert cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
