    "intro": "Convallaria thunbergii, commonly known as the European Lily-of-the-Valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pinkish flowers. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. The flowers emit a subtle fragrance and are pollinated primarily by insects."
