    "intro": "Canarium acutifolium var. pioriverensis, commonly known as the Pioriver nut tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the humid lowland forests of South America. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces edible seeds enclosed in a hard, woody capsule, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate with adequate rainfall. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable in its native range."
