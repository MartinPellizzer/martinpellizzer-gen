    "intro": "Calciphilopteris ludens, commonly known as the limestone fern, is a species of fern that thrives in calcareous soils. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically green or pale in color. This plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Calciphilopteris ludens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in its native range."
