    "intro": "Cinnamomum luddemannii, commonly known as the Luddemann's cinnamon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces oval, reddish-brown fruits that contain a single seed. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. However, it is less commonly cultivated than other cinnamon species due to its specific environmental requirements."
