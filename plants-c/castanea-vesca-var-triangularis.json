This variant is a cultivar of the horse chestnut tree, characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped leaves. It is native to the Caucasus region and is valued for its ornamental foliage. The plant produces spiny, capsule-like fruits that contain edible nuts, though they are not as commonly consumed as those of other chestnut species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
