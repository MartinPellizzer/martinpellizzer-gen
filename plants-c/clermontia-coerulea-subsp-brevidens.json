    "intro": "Clermontia coerulea subsp. brevidens, commonly known as the Hawaiian bluebell, is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. The plant features showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, this subspecies is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
