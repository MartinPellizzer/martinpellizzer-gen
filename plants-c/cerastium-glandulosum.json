    "intro": "Cerastium glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture, which helps in reducing water loss. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and garden beds. Its flowering stems are usually prostrate or ascending, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds."
