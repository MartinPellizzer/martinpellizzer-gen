    "intro": "Clinacanthus spirei, commonly known as the spiral spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care. Clinacanthus spirei is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
