    "intro": "Cleistes pusilla, commonly known as the small cleistocarp, is a delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Oenotheraceae family and is characterized by its small, closed flowers that remain hidden beneath the leaves. The plant produces a unique, urn-shaped fruit that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cleistes pusilla thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its short blooming period and rare occurrence make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
