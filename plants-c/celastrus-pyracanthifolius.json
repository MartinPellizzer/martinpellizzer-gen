    "intro": "Celastrus pyracanthifolius, commonly known as the spiny-flowered bittersweet, is a deciduous climbing shrub native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with 5 to 9 oval-shaped leaflets, often with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its woody stems are armed with spines, which help in climbing and provide protection. The species is valued in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
