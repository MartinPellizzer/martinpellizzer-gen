    "intro": "Campanula persicifolia var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are lanceolate, meaning they are narrow and tapering at both ends, with a slightly hairy surface. This variety thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
