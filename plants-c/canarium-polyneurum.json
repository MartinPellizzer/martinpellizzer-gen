    "intro": "Canarium polyneurum, commonly known as the white nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Its most notable feature is the seed kernel, which resembles nutmeg in appearance and aroma, though it is not related to the true nutmeg. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
