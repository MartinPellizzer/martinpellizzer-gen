    "intro": "Carex maritima, commonly known as salt meadow cordgrass, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in saline environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats, and is adapted to withstand high salinity and periodic flooding. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces spike-like inflorescences containing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Carex maritima plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species."
