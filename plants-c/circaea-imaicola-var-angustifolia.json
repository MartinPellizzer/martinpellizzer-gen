    "intro": "Circaea imaicola var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, linear leaves that are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to cold climates, with a compact growth form and short flowering period."
