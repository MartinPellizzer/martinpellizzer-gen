    "intro": "Cogswellia insularis, commonly known as the Socotra cactus, is a unique succulent native to the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Cogswellia insularis is also notable for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
