    "intro": "Cynodon diffusus, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Buffalo grass is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for low-maintenance lawns. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread rapidly and form dense turf."
