    "intro": "Cotoneaster melanocarpus, commonly known as the black-fruited cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features dense, thorny branches and small, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple to black berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive form and seasonal interest."
