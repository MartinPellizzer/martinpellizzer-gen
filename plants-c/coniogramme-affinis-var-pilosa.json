It features compound leaves with a distinctive, feathery appearance, and its foliage is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique addition to both natural ecosystems and botanical gardens."
