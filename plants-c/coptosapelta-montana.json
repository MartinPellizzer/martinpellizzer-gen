    "intro": "Coptosapelta montana, commonly known as the mountain coptosapelta, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Coptosapelta montana is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
