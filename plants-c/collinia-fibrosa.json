    "intro": "Collinia fibrosa, commonly known as the fibrous collinia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Collinia fibrosa is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
