It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically light green with a slightly bluish tint. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on slender stalks during the summer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions and requires minimal watering. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
