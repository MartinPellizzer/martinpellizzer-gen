    "intro": "Conocephalus intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate conocephalus, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its root system is fibrous, contributing to soil stabilization in its wetland habitat. Conocephalus intermedius is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and help remediate polluted water environments."
