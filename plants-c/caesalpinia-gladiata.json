It is characterized by its long, narrow leaflets that resemble a sword, giving it its common name. The plant produces bright orange or red flowers in clusters, which are often used in ornamental horticulture. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind. Caesalpinia gladiata is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
