It features slender, erect stems with lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the autumn season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understoreys. The orchid's unique floral structure and adaptability to specific habitats make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
