    "intro": "Catasetum tricorne, commonly known as the Tricorne Catasetum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, triangular-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored, ranging from yellow to orange. The plant produces a unique type of pollination structure called a \"labellum,\" which is modified to trap and guide pollinators. Its roots are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. The species is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and ease of cultivation."
