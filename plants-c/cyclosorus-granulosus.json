    "intro": "Cyclosorus granulosus, commonly known as the granular cyclosorus, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, leafy plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive morphology with closely spaced, rounded leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are often clustered near the base of the plant. Cyclosorus granulosus is relatively uncommon and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists studying bryophyte ecology."
