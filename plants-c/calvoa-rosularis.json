    "intro": "Calvoa rosularis, commonly known as the Rosular Rose, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and is distinguished by its clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Calvoa rosularis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
