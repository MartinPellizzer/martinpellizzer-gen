    "intro": "Cerasus bifrons, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or yamabuki, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn, adding to its ornamental value. Its fruits are small, red drupes that ripen in summer and are edible but not commonly consumed. Cerasus bifrons is widely cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and parks."
