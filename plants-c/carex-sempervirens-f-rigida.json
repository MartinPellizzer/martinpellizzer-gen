    "intro": "Carex sempervirens f. rigida, commonly known as rigid sedge, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and shaded woodland areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, water-tolerant plant."
