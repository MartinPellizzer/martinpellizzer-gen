    "intro": "Cyclosorus falcilobus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches itself to submerged rocks or vegetation. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor the plant while spreading across the substrate. The leaves are usually pinnately divided, with lance-shaped lobes that give the plant its distinctive appearance."
