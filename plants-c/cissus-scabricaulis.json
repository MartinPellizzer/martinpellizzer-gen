    "intro": "Cissus scabricaulis, commonly known as the roughstem devil's ivy, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and ability to adhere to surfaces using tendrils. The leaves are typically heart-shaped, with a rough, textured surface that gives the plant its common name. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. This plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its hardiness and adaptability to various growing conditions."
