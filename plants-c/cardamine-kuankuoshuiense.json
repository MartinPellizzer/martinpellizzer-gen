    "intro": "Cardamine kuankuoshuiense, commonly known as the Kuankuoshui watercress, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
