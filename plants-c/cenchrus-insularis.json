    "intro": "Cenchrus insularis, commonly known as the island grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
