    "intro": "Cyclopogon obliquus, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag pattern in the arrangement of its leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Cyclopogon obliquus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage structure."
