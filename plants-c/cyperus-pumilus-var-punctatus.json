    "intro": "Cyperus pumilus var. punctatus, commonly known as the punctate flatsedge, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, grass-like stems that are often slightly hairy, with small, triangular leaves arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically green with a distinctive white or pale green dot pattern, giving it its common name. It is often found in shallow water or damp soil, contributing to the ecological diversity of wetland habitats."
