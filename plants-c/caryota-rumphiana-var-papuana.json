    "intro": "Caryota rumphiana var. papuana, commonly known as the papuan arrowleaf or papuan palm, is a species of palm native to the tropical regions of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in branched clusters, followed by edible, black, spherical fruits. Its trunk is typically slender and covered with a fibrous, palmate sheath that persists for many years. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments."
