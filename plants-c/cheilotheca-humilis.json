    "intro": "Cheilotheca humilis, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh orchid, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters, featuring slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils, and its flowers bloom from June to August. It is often found in moist to wet habitats, such as bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Cheilotheca humilis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
