    "intro": "Ceratostylis pulchella, commonly known as the pretty orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a slender, erect stem with several narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil. This species is valued for its ornamental potential despite its subtle floral display."
