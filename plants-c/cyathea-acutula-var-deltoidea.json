    "intro": "Cyathea acutula var. deltoidea, commonly known as the delta fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive shape that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
