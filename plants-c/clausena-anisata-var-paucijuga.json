    "intro": "Clausena anisata var. paucijuga, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tamarind, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters with a dense, rounded crown. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate to elliptic, often with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, sour-tasting fruits that are similar in appearance to tamarind. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit in tropical regions."
