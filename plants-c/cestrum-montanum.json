    "intro": "Cestrum montanum, commonly known as the mountain cestrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in the evening. These flowers are adapted for pollination by night-flying insects such as moths. Cestrum montanum is also known for its mildly toxic berries, which contain cardiac glycosides."
