    "intro": "Coronilla latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf crownvetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with 10\u201320 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant forms dense mats through its extensive root system, making it a common invasive species in some regions. It has a deep taproot that allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in agricultural and ecological restoration contexts."
