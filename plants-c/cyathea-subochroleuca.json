    "intro": "Cyathea subochroleuca, commonly known as the golden tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant is evergreen and can grow up to several meters in height, with a slow growth rate. Its fronds are typically bright green and can be quite ornamental, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in moist, shaded environments."
