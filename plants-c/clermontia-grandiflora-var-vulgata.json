    "intro": "Clermontia grandiflora var. vulgata, commonly known as the common clermontia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces bright orange or red flowers that are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly honeycreepers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
