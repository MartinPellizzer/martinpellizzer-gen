    "intro": "Chrysopsis gigantea, commonly known as the giant goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Chrysopsis gigantea is an important species for pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, due to its abundant nectar-rich flowers."
