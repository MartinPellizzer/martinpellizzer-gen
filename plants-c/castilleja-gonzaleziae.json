It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bright red to orange flowers. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on root connections with neighboring plants for nutrients. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its specialized ecological role, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of healthy, undisturbed ecosystems."
