    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum unciniferum, commonly known as the hooked-petal orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring elongated, hooked petals that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are usually small and pale, with a delicate, almost translucent appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cirrhopetalum unciniferum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
