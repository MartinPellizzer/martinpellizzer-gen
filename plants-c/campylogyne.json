    "intro": "Campylogyne, commonly known as the \"spiny hibiscus,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive spiny stems, which provide structural support and deter herbivores. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and often have a rough or hairy texture. Flowers are showy, with five petals and prominent stamens, and they bloom in clusters. Native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia, Campylogyne species are often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in semi-arid conditions."
