    "intro": "Cylindropuntia libertadensis, commonly known as the Libertad cactus, is a species native to the United States, specifically found in Arizona and New Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptations to arid environments include a shallow root system and the ability to store water in its stems. The cactus is also known for its role in local ecosystems and its use by indigenous peoples for food and medicine."
