    "intro": "Crataegus pinnatiloba var. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe thornapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with 5 to 9 leaflets, and its distinctive globose (globular) fruit, which is typically red or orange when mature. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in spring, which are followed by the showy, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or thickets. The species is notable for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
