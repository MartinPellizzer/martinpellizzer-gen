    "intro": "Campylobotrys discolor, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers and its unique, translucent, waxy leaves that give it its common name. This epiphytic plant grows on trees in wet, shaded environments, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinct, ghost-like appearance that contributes to its mysterious allure. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
