    "intro": "Cousinia glauciifolia, commonly known as the blue-flowered cinquefoil, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has basal rosettes of silver-gray leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its stems are often hairy and can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. Cousinia glauciifolia is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and rocky habitats."
