    "intro": "Carex muehlenbergii var. enervis, commonly known as the slender marsh sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spiky inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshes, swamps, or along the edges of ponds. Its flowering stems produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. The varietal form enervis is distinguished by its slightly shorter and more slender leaves compared to the typical variety."
