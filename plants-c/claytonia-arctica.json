    "intro": "Claytonia arctica, commonly known as the Arctic spring beauty, is a small flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, grass-like leaves and clusters of delicate white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to short growing seasons. Its flowers typically bloom in early spring, often before the surrounding vegetation has emerged. Claytonia arctica is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in alpine ecosystems."
