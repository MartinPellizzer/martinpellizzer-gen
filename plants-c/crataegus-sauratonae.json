It is native to the southeastern United States, specifically the Sauratown Mountains in North Carolina. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, oval-shaped leaves, and white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit, a small, red berry, matures in the fall and is edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its historical use in traditional medicine."
