    "intro": "Cycnium hamatum, commonly known as the common salsify, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by elongated, spindle-shaped seeds. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Cycnium hamatum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
