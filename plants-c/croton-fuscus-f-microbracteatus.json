    "intro": "Croton fuscus f. microbracteatus, commonly known as the dwarf croton, is a compact, ornamental shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features dense, dark green foliage with striking, colorful leaf patterns that vary in shades of yellow, red, and orange. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care, it is popular in both garden settings and as a houseplant."
