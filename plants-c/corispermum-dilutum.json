    "intro": "Corispermum dilutum, commonly known as the slender bladderwrack, is a species of flowering plant in the family Corispermaceae. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in saline or brackish wetlands. The plant has small, linear leaves and produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually green or yellowish in color. Its seeds are enclosed in small, bladder-like structures, which aid in dispersal. Corispermum dilutum is adapted to coastal environments and is often found in regions with high salinity and fluctuating water levels."
