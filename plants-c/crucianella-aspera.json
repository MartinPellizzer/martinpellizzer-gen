    "intro": "Crucianella aspera, commonly known as the rough sea bean, is a small shrub native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, bean-like fruits that are often covered in a rough, textured surface. It thrives in saline and coastal environments, demonstrating a high degree of salt tolerance. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in coastal restoration projects to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
