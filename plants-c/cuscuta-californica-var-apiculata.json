    "intro": "Cuscuta californica var. apiculata, commonly known as the California dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thin, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to California and thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through the movement of host plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host species."
