    "intro": "Cyathea javanica, commonly known as the Java tree fern, is a large evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rhyzome. The plant produces fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and can grow up to several meters in height. Cyathea javanica thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
