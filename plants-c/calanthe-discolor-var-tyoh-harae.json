    "intro": "Calanthe discolor var. tyoh-harae, commonly known as the Tyoh-hara calanthe, is a rare orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its striking white and green variegated leaves and pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid forest environments, preferring well-drained, acidic soil. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulbous structure, which helps it store water and nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
