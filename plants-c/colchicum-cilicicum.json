    "intro": "Colchicum cilicicum, commonly known as the Cilician colchic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant produces a rosette of basal leaves and has a short, stout stem. Its flowers are typically violet to purple in color, with a unique, spurred shape that distinguishes it from other colchic species. Colchicum cilicicum is often found in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to dry, temperate climates."
