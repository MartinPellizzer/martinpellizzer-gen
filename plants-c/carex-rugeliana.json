    "intro": "Carex rugeliana, commonly known as the rugose sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are often rough to the touch due to the presence of small, raised dots called papillae. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three stamens and a three-lobed pistil, typical of the sedge family."
