    "intro": "Cypripedium cheniae, commonly known as the Chinese lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild."
