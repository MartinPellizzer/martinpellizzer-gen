    "intro": "Cypripedium planipetalum, commonly known as the flat-petaled lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in rich, humus-filled soil. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
