    "intro": "Cracca brandegeei, commonly known as the Brandegee's cracca, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with ray florets that give it a dandelion-like appearance. Cracca brandegeei is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
