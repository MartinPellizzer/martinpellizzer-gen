    "intro": "Cyrtandra fauriei, commonly known as the Hawaiian cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant is often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from invasive species, Cyrtandra fauriei is considered a rare and endangered species."
