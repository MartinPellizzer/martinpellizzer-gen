    "intro": "Cycas rumphii var. timorensis, commonly known as the Timor cycad, is a species of cycad native to the island of Timor. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal water. Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
