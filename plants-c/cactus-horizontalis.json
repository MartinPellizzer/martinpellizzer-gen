    "intro": "Cactus horizontalis, commonly known as the flat-topped cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and flattened, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often followed by small, red fruits. Its adaptations to desert conditions include thick, waxy cuticles and spines for protection against herbivores and extreme temperatures. Cactus horizontalis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
