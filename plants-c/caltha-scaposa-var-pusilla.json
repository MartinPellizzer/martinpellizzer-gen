    "intro": "Caltha scaposa var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has slender, upright stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in rich, organic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and early blooming habit, it is a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
