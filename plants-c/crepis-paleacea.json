    "intro": "Crepis paleacea, commonly known as the pale everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a cluster, surrounded by bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue, and it is known for its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Crepis paleacea is often used in dried floral arrangements due to its long-lasting, delicate blooms."
