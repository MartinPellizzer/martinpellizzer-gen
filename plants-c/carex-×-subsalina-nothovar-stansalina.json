    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 subsalina nothovar. stansalina, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex subulata and Carex salina. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish-brown flowers. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in wetland or marshy environments. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. The nothovar. stansalina is a naturally occurring variant that exhibits traits from both parent species."
