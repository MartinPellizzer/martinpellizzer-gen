    "intro": "Cereus eburneus, commonly known as the white candle cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and sparse, white spines. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. The plant's name reflects its pale, almost ivory-colored appearance."
