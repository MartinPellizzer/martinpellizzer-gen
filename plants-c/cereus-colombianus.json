    "intro": "Cereus colombianus, commonly known as the Colombian candleplant, is a cactus native to South America, particularly Colombia. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
