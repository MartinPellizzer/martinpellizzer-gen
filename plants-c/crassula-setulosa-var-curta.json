It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight blue or purple hue. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate sunlight, making it suitable for indoor or outdoor cultivation. Its compact growth habit and low maintenance needs make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
