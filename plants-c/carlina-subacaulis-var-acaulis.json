    "intro": "Carlina subacaulis var. acaulis, commonly known as the slender carline thorn, is a perennial herb native to the high elevations of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
