It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries. The species is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions."
