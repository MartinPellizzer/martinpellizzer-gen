    "intro": "Carex ferruginea f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically reddish-brown at the base, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity."
