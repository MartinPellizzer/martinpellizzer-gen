    "intro": "Cephalanthera lonchophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf green twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is mycoheterotrophic, meaning it relies on fungal associations for most of its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its specialized habitat and conservation status, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
