    "intro": "Cohniella cayennensis, commonly known as the Cayenne cohniella, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
