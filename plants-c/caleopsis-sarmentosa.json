    "intro": "Caleopsis sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping caleopsis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are alternate, linear to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small, yellowish, and arranged in dense spikes, typical of the Brassicaceae family."
