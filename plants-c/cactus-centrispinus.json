    "intro": "Cactus centrispinus, commonly known as the spiny cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny tubercles that provide protection against herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warm season, which are typically borne in the axils of the spines. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains. Cactus centrispinus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
