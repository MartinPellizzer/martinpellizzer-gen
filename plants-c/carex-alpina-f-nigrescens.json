It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its dark green foliage distinguishes it from other Carex species, and it is adapted to cold climates. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
