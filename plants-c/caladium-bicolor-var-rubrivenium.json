    "intro": "Caladium bicolor var. rubrivenium, commonly known as the red-veined caladium, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with bold, crimson veins against a pale green or white background. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage rather than its small, inconspicuous flowers. Caladium bicolor var. rubrivenium is typically grown as an annual in regions with cold winters."
