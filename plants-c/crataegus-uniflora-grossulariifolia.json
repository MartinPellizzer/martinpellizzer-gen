It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. Its fruit is a small, red drupe that ripens in the fall, attracting various wildlife species. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its showy blooms."
