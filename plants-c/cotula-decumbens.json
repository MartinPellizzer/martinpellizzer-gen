    "intro": "Cotula decumbens, commonly known as yellow cotula, is a low-growing annual herb native to southern Africa. It features small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a distinctive grayish-green color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats."
