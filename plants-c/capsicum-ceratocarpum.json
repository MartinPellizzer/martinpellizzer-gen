    "intro": "Capsicum ceratocarpum, commonly known as the horned pepper, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its distinctive, horn-like calyces that encase the fruit. The plant produces small, yellow or orange berries that are typically harvested when fully mature. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in fine hairs. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in culinary applications compared to other capsicum varieties."
