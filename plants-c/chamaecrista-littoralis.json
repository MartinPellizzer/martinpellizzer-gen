    "intro": "Chamaecrista littoralis, commonly known as coast senna, is a perennial shrub native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by narrow, bean-like pods. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Chamaecrista littoralis is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important pioneer species in coastal succession."
