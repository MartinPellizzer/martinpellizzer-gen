    "intro": "Ctenitis reunionensis, commonly known as the Reunion fern, is a rare species native to the island of R\u00e9union in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble a fern. The plant has a unique morphology with small, overlapping leaflets that form a dense, bushy appearance. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
