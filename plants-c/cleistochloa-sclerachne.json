It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically enclosed within leaf sheaths, a feature common in many grasses. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed areas. Cleistochloa sclerachne is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings."
