    "intro": "Cercocarpus betulifolius, commonly known as the Sierra Madre buckthorn, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of a birch tree, hence its common name. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Cercocarpus betulifolius is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
