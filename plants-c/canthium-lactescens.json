    "intro": "Canthium lactescens, commonly known as the milkweed vine, is a tropical plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by capsules containing numerous tiny seeds. It is native to regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its milky sap, it is sometimes referred to as a member of the milkweed family, though it is not closely related to the true milkweeds."
