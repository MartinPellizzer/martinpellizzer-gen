    "intro": "Cardiospermum heringeri, commonly known as the balloon vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble small balloons. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in fleshy, orange-colored pods that split open when mature to disperse the seeds. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
