It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically green with a distinctive reddish or purple underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
