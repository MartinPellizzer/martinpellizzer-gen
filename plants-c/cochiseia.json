    "intro": "Cochiseia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Agavaceae and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plants typically have thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to the harsh desert environment. Cochiseia species are often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. Their showy flowers, which range from white to pale yellow, attract pollinators such as bees and moths."
