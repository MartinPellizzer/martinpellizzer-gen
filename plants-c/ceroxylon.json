These plants are native to South America, particularly in regions of Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. They are characterized by their tall, slender trunks covered in a thick layer of waxy, white substance. Ceroxylon species typically grow in humid, tropical environments and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. The genus includes several species, with Ceroxylon quindiuense being the most well-known for its ecological and cultural significance."
