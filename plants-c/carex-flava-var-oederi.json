    "intro": "Carex flava var. oederi, commonly known as yellow sedge, is a variant of the common sedge species Carex flava. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically found in moist, sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves that are usually yellow-green in color, and it forms dense clumps through rhizomes. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of female flowers, with male flowers often found in a separate, shorter spike. This plant is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
