    "intro": "Chylodia, commonly known as the \"buttercup plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It is characterized by its showy, often yellow or orange flowers with five petals and a central cluster of stamens. The leaves are typically palmately divided, giving the plant a delicate, fern-like appearance. Chylodia species are often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They are known for their attractive blooms but can be toxic to livestock and humans if ingested."
