    "intro": "Cyrtanthus mckenii subsp. cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's cycadopsis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a single, tall stem with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its bulbs are adapted for storing water and nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts and conservationists."
