    "intro": "Cienkowskiella aethiopica, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to East Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant is typically grown as a houseplant due to its preference for warm, humid conditions and indirect light. It produces small, fleshy roots that help it absorb moisture efficiently, making it relatively drought-tolerant once established."
