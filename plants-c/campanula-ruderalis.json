    "intro": "Campanula ruderalis, commonly known as the common bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in ruderal habitats. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and its flowers are often visited by pollinators like bees and butterflies. Campanula ruderalis is relatively easy to cultivate and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
