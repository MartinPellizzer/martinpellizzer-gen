    "intro": "Cirsium discolor f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered thistle, is a botanical variant of the common plume thistle. It is characterized by its pale white to pale blue flowers, which contrast with the typical purple or pink blooms of the species. The plant is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. Its foliage consists of spiny, lobed leaves, typical of the Cirsium genus. The white-flowered form is less common than the standard variety, making it a notable ornamental and horticultural specimen."
