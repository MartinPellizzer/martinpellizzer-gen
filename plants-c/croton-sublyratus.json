    "intro": "Croton sublyratus, commonly known as the silver croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in a waxy, silvery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Croton sublyratus is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for garden use in tropical and subtropical regions."
