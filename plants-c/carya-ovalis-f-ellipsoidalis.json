    "intro": "Carya ovalis f. ellipsoidalis, commonly known as the elliptic hickory, is a variation of the hickory tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elliptical, thick-shelled nuts and its overall resemblance to the common hickory species. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, typically turning yellow in the fall. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in catkins, and its fruit is an edible nut that is highly valued for its flavor and oil content. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
