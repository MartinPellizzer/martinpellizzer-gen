    "intro": "Coincya pseudoerucastrum subsp. johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's water clover, is a rare aquatic plant characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically oval or heart-shaped. It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is native to specific freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia. The plant has a delicate, branching root system that helps it anchor in shallow waters. Its flowers, which are small and inconspicuous, are usually borne on short stalks above the water surface. This subspecies is noted for its limited distribution and is often found in still or slow-moving water bodies."
