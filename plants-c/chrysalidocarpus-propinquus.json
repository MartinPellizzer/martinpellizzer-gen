It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and pinnate leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into three-lobed fruits, each containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
