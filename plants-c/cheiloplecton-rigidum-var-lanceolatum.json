    "intro": "Cheiloplecton rigidum var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceolate sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its rigid, spiny stems and lanceolate, waxy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, demonstrating a high degree of salt tolerance. Its structure and morphology make it well-suited for stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal areas."
