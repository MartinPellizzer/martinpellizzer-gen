    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 pseudograndis, commonly known as the rough lemon. It is a hybrid citrus plant originating from a cross between the citron and the mandarin. The tree is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, yellow-orange fruit. The fruit has a thick, bitter rind and a segmented, juicy pulp. It is primarily cultivated for its aromatic peel rather than its fruit, which is often used in perfumery and traditional medicine."
