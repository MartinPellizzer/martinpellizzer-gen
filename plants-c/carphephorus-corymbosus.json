    "intro": "Carphephorus corymbosus, commonly known as the clustered sedge, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and swampy areas. The plant produces tiny, three-lobed flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
