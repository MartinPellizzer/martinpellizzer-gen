It features upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, adorned with lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers with prominent yellow stamens, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Crusea longiflora thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and prolonged flowering period."
