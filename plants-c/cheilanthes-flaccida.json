    "intro": "Cheilanthes flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain throughout the year, providing a consistent green presence in its habitat. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments, often growing on cliffs or in crevices where it can access moisture from morning dew. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients, which is an adaptation to its often harsh environment. The fronds are typically divided into pinnae with a distinctive, shield-like shape, contributing to its common name."
