    "intro": "Cullumia squarrosa, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are showy, with white to pale blue petals and a prominent yellow center, blooming in late spring to early summer. Cullumia squarrosa is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability, making it a resilient species in harsh desert conditions."
