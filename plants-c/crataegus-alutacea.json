    "intro": "Crataegus alutacea, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full to partial sunlight. The narrowleaf hawthorn is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
