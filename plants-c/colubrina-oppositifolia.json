    "intro": "Colubrina oppositifolia, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive blue-green hue. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by blue-violet berries that ripen in the fall. These berries are not only ornamental but also serve as a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
