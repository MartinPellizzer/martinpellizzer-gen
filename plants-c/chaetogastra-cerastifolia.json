It features distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, with a spiky appearance due to the presence of bracts. The plant has a fibrous root system and grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
