    "intro": "Cinnamomum xylophyllum, commonly known as the Philippine cinnamon or talafofo, is a small evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and bark, which contain essential oils responsible for its distinctive scent. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice, while its bark is valued for its fragrance and medicinal properties. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
