    "intro": "Cattleya, commonly known as the orchid, is a genus of epiphytic and lithophytic orchids native to the tropical regions of the Americas. These plants are characterized by their showy, fragrant flowers that often come in a wide range of colors, including white, pink, red, and yellow. Cattleya orchids typically have pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing them to thrive in their natural habitats. They require bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to flourish. The genus is highly valued in horticulture for its beauty and adaptability to cultivation."
