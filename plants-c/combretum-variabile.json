    "intro": "Combretum variabile, commonly known as the variable combretum, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom during the dry season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Combretum variabile is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including savannas and woodland edges."
