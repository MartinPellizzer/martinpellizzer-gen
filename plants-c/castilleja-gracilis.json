    "intro": "Castilleja gracilis, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant found primarily in the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and has a distinctive appearance with bright orange to red flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has small, scale-like structures that help it absorb nutrients from its host. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Castilleja gracilis plays a role in its ecosystem by interacting with various host plants and contributing to biodiversity."
