    "intro": "Cyathea angolensis, commonly known as the Angola tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, trunk-like structure covered in a layer of dead fronds. The plant has large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length, contributing to its dramatic appearance. Cyathea angolensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle."
