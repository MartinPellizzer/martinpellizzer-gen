    "intro": "Corunastylis laminata, commonly known as the broad-leafed star sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its linear, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters during the spring and summer months. Corunastylis laminata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting a variety of pollinators and aquatic life."
