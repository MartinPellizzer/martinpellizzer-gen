It features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has smooth, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, giving it its specific epithet. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
