    "intro": "Coryphadenia monantha, commonly known as the Hawaiian tree fern, is a unique member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant features a tall, unbranched trunk with a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach impressive lengths. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize the soil and supports the growth of other plant species. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
