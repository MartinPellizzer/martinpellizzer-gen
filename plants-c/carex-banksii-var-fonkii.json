    "intro": "Carex banksii var. fonkii, commonly known as the Klamath sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in wetland environments. It is an important component of riparian and wetland ecosystems."
