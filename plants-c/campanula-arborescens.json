    "intro": "Campanula arborescens, commonly known as the tree bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring a woody base and branching stems. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its root system consists of a rhizome that helps it survive in various soil conditions. Campanula arborescens is often found in woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks."
