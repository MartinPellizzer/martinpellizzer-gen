    "intro": "Cyperus teretifructus, commonly known as the narrow-fruit sedges, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and cylindrical flower clusters. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has slender, triangular stems and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cyperus teretifructus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
