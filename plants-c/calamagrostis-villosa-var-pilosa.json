    "intro": "Calamagrostis villosa var. pilosa, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, typically in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a useful plant for wetland restoration and ecological landscaping."
