    "intro": "Ctenopteris hombersleyi, commonly known as the Hombersley's sea palm, is a rare and unique species of fern found in the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of small, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in shallow marine environments, typically growing on rocky substrates near the intertidal zone. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human activity."
