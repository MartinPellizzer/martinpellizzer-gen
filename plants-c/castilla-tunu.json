    "intro": "Castilla tunu, commonly known as the velvetleaf or castilla, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Castilla tunu is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields due to its adaptability. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
