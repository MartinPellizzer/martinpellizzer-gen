It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a tall, branched stem that bears purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its latex-like sap is milky and can cause skin irritation. Carduus wolgensis is often found in alpine meadows and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
