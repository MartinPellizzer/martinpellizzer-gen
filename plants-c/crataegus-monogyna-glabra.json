    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna glabra, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red berries in the autumn, which are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks, thriving in a variety of soil types. The common hawthorn is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
