    "intro": "Calytrix tetragona, commonly known as the four-angle bush or coastal bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal regions and sandy soils, often found in the southern and eastern parts of the country. The plant produces bright red or pink flowers that bloom in winter, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Calytrix tetragona is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
