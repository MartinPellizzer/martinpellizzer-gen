    "intro": "Coelogyne squamulosa, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on trees rather than in soil, and it prefers warm, humid environments. Coelogyne squamulosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
