    "intro": "Cardamine macrophylla subsp. acutidentata, commonly known as the acute-toothed watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features finely divided, pinnately lobed leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its small, white or greenish flowers are borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
