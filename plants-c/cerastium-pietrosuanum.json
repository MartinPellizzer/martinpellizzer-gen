    "intro": "Cerastium pietrosuanum, commonly known as rock chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Cerastium pietrosuanum is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a common sight in mountainous and rocky habitats."
