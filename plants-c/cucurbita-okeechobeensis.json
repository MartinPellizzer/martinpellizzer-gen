    "intro": "Cucurbita okeechobeensis, commonly known as the Okeechobee pumpkin, is a rare and endangered species native to the Everglades of Florida. It is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, characterized by its sprawling vines and large, lobed leaves. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that transition into orange to red fruits, which are typically round or oval in shape. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to wetland environments and its role in the ecological diversity of the region. Due to habitat loss, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
