    "intro": "Cuscuta pycnantha, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has thin, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and can be found in various habitats, including fields and woodlands. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and native vegetation."
