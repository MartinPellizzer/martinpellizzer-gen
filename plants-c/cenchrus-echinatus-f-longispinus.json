    "intro": "Cenchrus echinatus f. longispinus, commonly known as the long-spined grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, bristle-tipped flowers. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its foliage is often used as forage for livestock in regions where water is scarce. The long, stiff bristles on its flowers and leaves are a distinctive feature that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds."
