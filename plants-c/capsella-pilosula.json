It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters and are followed by rounded, hairy seed pods. The plant is often considered a weed but has some historical uses in herbal medicine."
