    "intro": "Cranichis talamancana, commonly known as the Talamancan orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central America. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in rich, organic soil. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. It has linear to lanceolate leaves and a short rhizome, which helps it anchor in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
