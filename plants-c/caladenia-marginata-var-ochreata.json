    "intro": "Caladenia marginata var. ochreata, commonly known as the ochre spider-orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Western Australia. It features a slender, hairy stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf and produces a single, strikingly colored flower with a pale yellow to ochre lip. The plant is adapted to grow in sandy soils and is often found in heathland environments. It blooms during the spring and summer seasons, relying on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
