    "intro": "Cyphia latipetala, commonly known as the broad-petalled cyphia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its showy, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or alpine environments, and thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Cyphia latipetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
