    "intro": "Carex inversa var. major, commonly known as the Upside-down Sedge, is a perennial sedge native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, where the spikes of flowers are inverted compared to typical sedges, with the lower spike being the male and the upper spike the female. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It is a valuable plant for wetland restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological study and ornamental gardening."
