    "intro": "Centropogon chiltasonensis, commonly known as the Chiltasan grassvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale blue or purple flowers, typical of the tribe Centropogoneae. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or semi-desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
