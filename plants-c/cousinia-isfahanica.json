    "intro": "Cousinia isfahanica, commonly known as the Isfahan cushion plant, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Iran. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette structure composed of tightly packed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a splash of color to its harsh environment. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Cousinia isfahanica is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
