    "intro": "Casearia chocoensis, commonly known as the Chocoan casearia, is a tropical shrub native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
