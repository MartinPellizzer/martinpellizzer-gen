    "intro": "Croton disraelii, commonly known as the Jerusalem cherry, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful leaves that range from green to shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to bright red, fleshy berries. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds, making them unsafe for consumption. Croton disraelii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage."
