    "intro": "Clusia penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging clusterleaf, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, often with a slight variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in pendulous inflorescences, giving it its common name. These flowers are followed by oval, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. Clusia penduliflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
