    "intro": "Circaea alpina var. sterilis, commonly known as the sterile alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open, sunny habitats. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. This variety is notable for its reduced fertility, as it is sterile and does not produce viable seeds."
