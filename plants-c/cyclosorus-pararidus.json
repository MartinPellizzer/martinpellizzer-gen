    "intro": "Cyclosorus pararidus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water clover, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Asia. It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its branching, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that emerge from the water, typically in late summer. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Cyclosorus pararidus is often found in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it plays a role in maintaining water quality."
