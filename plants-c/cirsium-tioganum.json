    "intro": "Cirsium tioganum, commonly known as the Tioga thistle, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with rough, serrated edges and a hairy texture. The flowers, which appear in late summer, are purple or pink and are surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves, giving the plant its thistle-like appearance."
