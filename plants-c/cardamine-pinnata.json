It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in racemes, often appearing in early spring. Cardamine pinnata is known for its edible leaves, which have a peppery taste similar to watercress."
