    "intro": "Chaenomeles sinensis, commonly known as Japanese flowering quince, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental, showy flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces yellow or orange fruit in late summer, which is edible but often used in jams and jellies. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it has a woody stem that becomes more pronounced with age. Chaenomeles sinensis is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
