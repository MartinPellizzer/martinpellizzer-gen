    "intro": "Celtis parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Celtis parvifolia is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
