    "intro": "Carlina acaulis subsp. acaulis, commonly known as the mountain cudweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit, with dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy composite flower heads, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale blue ray florets. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
