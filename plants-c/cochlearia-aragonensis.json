    "intro": "Cochlearia aragonensis, commonly known as the Aragon horned poppy, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-shaped petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
