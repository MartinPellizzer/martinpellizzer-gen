    "intro": "Campanula spruneriana var. lepidota, commonly known as the silver bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a white or pale throat. The leaves are typically silver-gray due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
