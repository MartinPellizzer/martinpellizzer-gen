    "intro": "Chrysanthemum decurrens, commonly known as the creeping chrysanthemum, is a herbaceous perennial native to China. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often used in garden landscapes and as a ground cover."
