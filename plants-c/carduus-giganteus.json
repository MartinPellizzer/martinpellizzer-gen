    "intro": "Carduus giganteus, commonly known as the giant thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to heights of 1 to 3 meters, making it a striking presence in its native habitat. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces achenes, small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in new areas."
