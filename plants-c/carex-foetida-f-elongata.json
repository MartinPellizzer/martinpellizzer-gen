    "intro": "Carex foetida f. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed bog sedge, is a variant of the bog sedge species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its elongated, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
