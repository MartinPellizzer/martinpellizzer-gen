It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy, succulent leaves. The plant thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often found in the mountainous regions of Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, rounded fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
