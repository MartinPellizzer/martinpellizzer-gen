    "intro": "Centrosema acutifolium, commonly known as the sharpleaf centrosema, is a leguminous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically narrow and pointed, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along streambanks. Centrosema acutifolium plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
