    "intro": "Centrostachys flabelligera, commonly known as the flabellate centrostachys, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that disperse its seeds effectively in the desert landscape."
