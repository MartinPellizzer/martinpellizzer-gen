    "intro": "Crabbea thymifolia, commonly known as the sweet sarsaparilla, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, tubular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a distinctive, spicy scent, which is attributed to its essential oils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its roots are used in traditional medicine. Crabbea thymifolia thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
