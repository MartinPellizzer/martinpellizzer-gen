    "intro": "Cirsium pseudohispanicum, commonly known as the hispanic thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It has a robust root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and its flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
