It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat, and can also be cultivated in soil. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are slender and branching. Columnea subcordata is prized for its ornamental value and is often grown in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
