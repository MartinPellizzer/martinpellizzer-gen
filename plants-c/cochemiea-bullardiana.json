    "intro": "Cochemiea bullardiana, commonly known as the Bullard's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus with pale green to blue-gray stems that are ribbed and covered in white to yellowish spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water once established. Cochemiea bullardiana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
