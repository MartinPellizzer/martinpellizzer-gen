    "intro": "Cynometra oaxacana, commonly known as the Oaxaca ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the humid tropical forests of Mexico. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, grayish bark. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in lowland and montane regions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
