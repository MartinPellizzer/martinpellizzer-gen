It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Centaurea inusta is often found in dry, sunny habitats like rocky soils and open fields. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
