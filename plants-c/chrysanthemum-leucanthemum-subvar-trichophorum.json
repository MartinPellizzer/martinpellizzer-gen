    "intro": "Chrysanthemum leucanthemum subvar. trichophorum, commonly known as the white wood aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow disc in the center, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has slender, branched stems and lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, white trichomes, giving it its subvariety name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, long-lasting blooms."
