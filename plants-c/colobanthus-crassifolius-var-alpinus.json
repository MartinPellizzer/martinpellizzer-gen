    "intro": "Colobanthus crassifolius var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine knotweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white\u7ed2\u6bdb. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates."
