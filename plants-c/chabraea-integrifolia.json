It is native to southeastern Australia, where it typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant features broad, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small and white, clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces woody fruits that contain several seeds. Chabraea integrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage and resilience to harsh conditions."
