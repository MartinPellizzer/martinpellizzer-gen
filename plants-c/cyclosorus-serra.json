    "intro": "Cyclosorus serra, commonly known as the serrated water shield, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often serrated along the edges, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged, followed by the production of buoyant, spore-like propagules. Cyclosorus serra plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
