    "intro": "Cicerbita macrantha, commonly known as the giant bittercress, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, large white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a low-growing habit with slender, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds. Cicerbita macrantha is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and in woodland edges."
