    "intro": "Commiphora stellulata, commonly known as the star myrrh tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is known for secreting a resinous gum, which has been used traditionally for medicinal and incense purposes. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
