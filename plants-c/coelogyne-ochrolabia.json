    "intro": "Coelogyne ochrolabia, commonly known as the yellow-lipped orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow lips and greenish-white petals, which make it visually distinctive. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often with a pleasant fragrance that attracts pollinators. Coelogyne ochrolabia is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in traditional medicine."
