It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered with a fine, almost hairless texture, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
