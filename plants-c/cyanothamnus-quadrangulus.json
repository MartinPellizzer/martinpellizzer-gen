    "intro": "Cyanothamnus quadrangulus, commonly known as the quadrangular bluebush, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Australia. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth habit with four-sided stems, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cyanothamnus quadrangulus is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions."
