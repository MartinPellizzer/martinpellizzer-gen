    "intro": "Cortaderia richardii, commonly known as the fountain grass, is a striking ornamental grass native to South America. It features tall, arching inflorescences that resemble a fountain, with long, narrow leaves that are usually blue-green in color. The plant is known for its dramatic visual impact, especially when in bloom, with feathery plumes that sway in the wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
