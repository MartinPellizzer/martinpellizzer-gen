    "intro": "Crossostemma, commonly known as the moonflower or nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are typically herbaceous or shrub-like, with showy, often white or pale flowers that open at night. The leaves are usually alternate and ovate, while the fruits are berries that contain toxic compounds. Crossostemma species are native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Due to their toxic properties, they are generally avoided for culinary use but have been studied for potential medicinal applications."
