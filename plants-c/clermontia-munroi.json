    "intro": "Clermontia munroi, commonly known as the Kauai clermonia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces white or pale blue flowers that bloom during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Clermontia munroi is considered a rare and endangered species."
