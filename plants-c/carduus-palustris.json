    "intro": "Carduus palustris, commonly known as swamp thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows up to 1 meter tall, with rough, hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves. Its roots are fibrous and can tolerate waterlogged soils, making it well adapted to marshy environments. It is often found in damp meadows, pond margins, and along streams."
