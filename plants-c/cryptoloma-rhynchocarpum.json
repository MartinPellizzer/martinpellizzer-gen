    "intro": "Cryptoloma rhynchocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruit cryptoloma, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces distinctive, narrow, ribbed fruits that are typically brown or reddish in color. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
