    "intro": "Cassia zygophylla, commonly known as the sand cassia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds over a wide area. Cassia zygophylla is adapted to survive in poor soils and can thrive with minimal water, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
