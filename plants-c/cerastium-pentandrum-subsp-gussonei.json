It typically features small, white flowers and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are opposite and ovate in shape. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
