    "intro": "Centropogon curvatus f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf red bottlebrush, is a compact, flowering shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy green, and it produces striking red or orange inflorescences that resemble bottlebrushes. The plant is characterized by its small stature, making it ideal for rock gardens or containers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
