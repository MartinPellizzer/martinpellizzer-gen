It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Chamaerhodiola gelida plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small Arctic organisms."
