    "intro": "Croton ovalifolius, commonly known as the oval-leaf croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval in shape, with a deep green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Croton ovalifolius is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and unique floral structure."
