    "intro": "Chaetobromus involucratus subsp. involucratus, commonly known as the woolly sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and grayish-green foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
