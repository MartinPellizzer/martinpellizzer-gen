    "intro": "Conchocarpus ruber, commonly known as the red mangrove or red mangrove fruit, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its red, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed, which is dispersed by water. Its roots form a complex system that helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. The plant plays an important role in the ecosystem of mangrove habitats, providing food and shelter for various marine and terrestrial species."
