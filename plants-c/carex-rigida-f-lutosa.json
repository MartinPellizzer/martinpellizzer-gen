    "intro": "Carex rigida f. lutosa, commonly known as the mossy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow, dark green, and often covered in a fine, moss-like coating. The subspecies lutosa is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and darker foliage compared to the typical form of Carex rigida."
