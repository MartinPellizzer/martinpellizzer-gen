    "intro": "Chamaebuxus venenosa var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender buckthorn, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves and berries contain anthraquinones, which are responsible for its laxative effects and toxicity. This plant thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in woodland edges and open areas."
