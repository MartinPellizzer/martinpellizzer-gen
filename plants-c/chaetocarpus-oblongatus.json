It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant is typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in saline environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Chaetocarpus oblongatus is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy shorelines."
