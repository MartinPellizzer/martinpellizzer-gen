    "intro": "Columnea campanulata, commonly known as the bell-shaped columnea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat, and produces showy, bell-shaped blooms that attract pollinators like hummingbirds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Columnea campanulata is popular in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
