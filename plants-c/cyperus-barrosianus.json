It is native to wetland habitats in the Americas, particularly in regions with seasonal flooding. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like inflorescences, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. Cyperus barrosianus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
