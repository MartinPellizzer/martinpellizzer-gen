    "intro": "Chamaesyce stictospora, commonly known as the stictospora sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters. The plant features small, green, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom in the spring. Chamaesyce stictospora is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
