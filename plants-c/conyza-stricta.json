    "intro": "Conyza stricta, commonly known as common ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its narrow, grass-like leaves and purple-tinted flower heads make it easily identifiable. Conyza stricta is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
