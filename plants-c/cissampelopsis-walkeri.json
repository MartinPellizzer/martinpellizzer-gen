It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage. Cissampelopsis walkeri is also noted for its ability to climb and trail, making it suitable for trellises or hanging baskets."
