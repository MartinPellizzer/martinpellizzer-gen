    "intro": "Ciconium humile, commonly known as the dwarf ciconium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters and features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are ovate, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy coating, adapting to humid environments. Ciconium humile is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories or along stream banks."
