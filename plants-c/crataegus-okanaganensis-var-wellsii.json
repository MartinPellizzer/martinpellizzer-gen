    "intro": "Crataegus okanaganensis var. wellsii, commonly known as the Okanagan hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but typically unpalatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woods, along streambanks, and in dry, rocky habitats."
