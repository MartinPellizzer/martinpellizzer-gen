    "intro": "Chironia angularis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved angular chironia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It features lanceolate to ovate leaves that are broad and slightly serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in shaded woodland areas and along stream banks."
