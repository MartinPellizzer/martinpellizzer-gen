    "intro": "Combretum platycarpum, commonly known as the broad-fruit combretum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often ovate or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by distinctive, flat, woody fruits that are covered in a thin, membranous layer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or riverine habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
