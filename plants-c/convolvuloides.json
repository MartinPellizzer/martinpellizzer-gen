    "intro": "Convolvuloides, commonly known as the false bindweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Convolvulaceae. These plants are typically herbaceous, with trailing or climbing stems that often have tendrils for support. The leaves are alternate, usually heart-shaped, and the flowers are funnel-shaped with five lobes. They produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Convolvuloides species are often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
