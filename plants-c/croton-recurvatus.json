    "intro": "Croton recurvatus, commonly known as the curly croton, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that often have a waxy, glossy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
