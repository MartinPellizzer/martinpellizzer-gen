It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, ovate leaves that vary in shape, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces white to pink flowers in spring, followed by red, persistent fruits that provide food for wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
