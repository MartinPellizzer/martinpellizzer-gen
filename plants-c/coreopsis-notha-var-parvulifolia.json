It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical variety. The plant produces bright yellow, daisy-like flowers with a distinctive yellow center and ray florets, blooming from late spring to early fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. This variety is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
