    "intro": "Corrigiola telephiifolia var. paronychioides, commonly known as the coastal sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to sandy coastal areas. It features small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. This variety is closely related to other members of the Caryophyllaceae family, sharing similar structural and ecological traits."
