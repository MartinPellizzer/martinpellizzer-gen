    "intro": "Coryanthes orbiculata, commonly known as the giant orchid or the bucket orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant's unique floral structure includes a specialized lip that serves as a pollination trap, attracting specific insects. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without parasitizing them. The plant requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
