    "intro": "Claytonia sibirica var. rhombifolia, commonly known as Siberian spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, rhombic-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
