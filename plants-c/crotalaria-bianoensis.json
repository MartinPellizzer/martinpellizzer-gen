    "intro": "Crotalaria bianoensis, commonly known as the Biano's crotalaria, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, and the plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility. However, it is also considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
