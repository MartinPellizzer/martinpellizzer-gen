    "intro": "Cypripedium hirsutum f. album, commonly known as the white hirsute lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white petals and a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination trap. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its native range."
