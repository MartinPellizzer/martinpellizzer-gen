    "intro": "Calandrinia eremaea, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, branching stems and small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, featuring succulent leaves and a deep root system to access moisture. It blooms during the cooler months, typically from spring to early summer. Calandrinia eremaea is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is an important plant in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
