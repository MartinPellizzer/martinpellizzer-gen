    "intro": "Centaurea alveicola, commonly known as the alpine centaury, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features slender stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, bright yellow to orange flowers arranged in compact clusters. Its flowers are often surrounded by bracts that give the appearance of a crown, hence its common name. Centaurea alveicola is known for its hardiness and ability to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions."
