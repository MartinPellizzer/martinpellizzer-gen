    "intro": "Cattleya flavida, commonly known as the Yellow Cattleya, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive, often fragrant, white or yellow lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often with a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Cattleya flavida is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
