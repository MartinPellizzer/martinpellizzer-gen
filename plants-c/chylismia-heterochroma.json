    "intro": "Chylismia heterochroma, commonly known as the heterochromatic chylismia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its strikingly contrasting leaf colors, which range from deep green to vibrant red or purple. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white or pale pink. Its unique pigmentation is due to the presence of specialized anthocyanin compounds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
