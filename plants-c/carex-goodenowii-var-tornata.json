    "intro": "Carex goodenowii var. tornata, commonly known as the Tornate sedge, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments. Due to its preference for moist conditions, it is a valuable component of riparian and wetland restoration projects."
