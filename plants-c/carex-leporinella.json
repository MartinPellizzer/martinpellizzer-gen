    "intro": "Carex leporinella, commonly known as the rabbit's ear sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and compact, spiky inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Native to wet or moist environments, this plant thrives in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common sight in freshwater habitats. The plant's ability to tolerate waterlogged soils makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
