    "intro": "Cypripedium macranthos var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy white petals and a distinctive pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in cool, moist forest environments, often in shaded areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers bloom in early summer, and it is highly valued for its ornamental beauty. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
