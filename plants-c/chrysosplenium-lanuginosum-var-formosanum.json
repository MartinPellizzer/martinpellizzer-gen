    "intro": "Chrysosplenium lanuginosum var. formosanum, commonly known as the silky chrysosplenium, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its soft, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and they bloom in early spring. The leaves are often covered in fine, silky hairs, which contribute to its common name and provide some protection against herbivory."
