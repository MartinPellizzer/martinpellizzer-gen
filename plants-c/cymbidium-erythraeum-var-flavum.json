    "intro": "Cymbidium erythraeum var. flavum, commonly known as the orange-lilac cymbidium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The petals and sepals are typically a vibrant combination of orange and lilac, with a distinctive yellow lip. This variety thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for both indoor cultivation and garden displays due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
