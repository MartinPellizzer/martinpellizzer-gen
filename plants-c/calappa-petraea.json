    "intro": "Calappa petraea, commonly known as the rock lettuce, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and compact growth habit make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions. Calappa petraea is often found growing on limestone or sandstone outcrops, thriving in nutrient-poor soils."
