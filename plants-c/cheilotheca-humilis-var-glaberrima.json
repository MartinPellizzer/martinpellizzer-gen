    "intro": "Cheilotheca humilis var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth cheilotheca, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, erect stems that bear small, pale green to yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has finely textured, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
