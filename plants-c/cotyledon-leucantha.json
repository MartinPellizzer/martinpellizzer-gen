    "intro": "Cotyledon leucantha, commonly known as the White Cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water efficiently. Cotyledon leucantha is popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance."
