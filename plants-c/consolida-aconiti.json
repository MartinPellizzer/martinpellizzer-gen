    "intro": "Consolida aconiti, commonly known as the yellow rocket or winter cress, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has pinnately lobed leaves and produces small, oval-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along streambanks. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation."
