    "intro": "Centaurea, commonly known as the knapweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their bright, often red or purple, composite flower heads that resemble daisies. Centaurea species typically have spiky, bristly leaves and are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Many species are found in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. They are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and some species have been studied for their potential medicinal properties."
