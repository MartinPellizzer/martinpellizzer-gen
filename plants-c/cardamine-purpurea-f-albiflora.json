    "intro": "Cardamine purpurea f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered purple cress, is a rare variant of the purple cress species. It is characterized by its pale or white flowers, which contrast with the typical purple blooms of the parent species. This plant is a member of the Brassicaceae family and typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors. Its leaves are trifoliate, with finely divided lobes, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. The plant's botanical features make it a subject of interest in botanical gardens and conservation efforts due to its limited distribution and unique floral morphology."
