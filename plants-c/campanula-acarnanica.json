    "intro": "Campanula acarnanica, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It features slender stems that often grow in a scrambling or creeping manner, reaching up to 60 centimeters in height. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Campanula acarnanica thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats."
