    "intro": "Caralluma marlothii var. viridis, commonly known as the green columnar cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a tall, cylindrical stem that is typically green in color, with a smooth, spiny surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stem to survive drought conditions. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
