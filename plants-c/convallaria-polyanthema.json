    "intro": "Convallaria polyanthema, commonly known as the clustered lily-of-the-valley, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the top of its slender stems. The plant produces small, dark berries that contain toxic seeds, a characteristic shared with other members of the Convallariaceae family. Its leaves are heart-shaped and glossy, often forming a dense rosette at the base. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
