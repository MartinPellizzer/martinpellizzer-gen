It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and fleshy, triangular-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The leaves are typically green with a bluish tint and are arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring and summer months. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
