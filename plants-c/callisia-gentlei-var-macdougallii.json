It features small, waxy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with silver or white, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate, spider-like inflorescences with tiny white flowers, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or as a ground cover. Its low maintenance and ornamental appeal make it a favored plant among indoor and outdoor gardeners."
