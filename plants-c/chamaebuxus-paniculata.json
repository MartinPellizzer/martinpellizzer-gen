It features small, glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color on the underside. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and sandy habitats.
