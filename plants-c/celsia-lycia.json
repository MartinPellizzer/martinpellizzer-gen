    "intro": "Celsia lycia, commonly known as the Cyprus cypress, is a rare and unique conifer native to the island of Cyprus. It is characterized by its slender, columnar form and dark green, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
