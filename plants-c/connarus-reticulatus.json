    "intro": "Connarus reticulatus, commonly known as the net-veined connarus, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with a distinctive reticulate venation pattern on both the upper and lower surfaces of its leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky or exposed terrain. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, Connarus reticulatus is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
