It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tint, arranged in a compact, bushy shape. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Crassula \u00d7 hybrida is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal."
