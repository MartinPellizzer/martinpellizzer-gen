    "intro": "Cyrtochilum serratum, commonly known as the serrated cyclochilum, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of South America. It features a compact, rhizomatous growth habit with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow with intricate patterns on the lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-draining, humus-rich soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species within its native range."
