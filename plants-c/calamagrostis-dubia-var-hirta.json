    "intro": "Calamagrostis dubia var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy marsh reed, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are hairy along their edges. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or pink hues. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
