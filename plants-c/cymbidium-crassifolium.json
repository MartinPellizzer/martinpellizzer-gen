    "intro": "Cymbidium crassifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a species native to China and Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herb with erect, branched stems and large, leathery leaves that are often broader than they are long. The plant produces tall spikes of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It prefers cool, humid conditions and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Cymbidium crassifolium is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often used in traditional Chinese gardens."
