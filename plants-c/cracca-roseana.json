    "intro": "Cracca roseana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Cracca roseana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
