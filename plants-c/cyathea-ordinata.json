    "intro": "Cyathea ordinata, commonly known as the common tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a large, evergreen fern that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots. The plant has a crown of compound, feather-like fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. Cyathea ordinata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique structure and growth habit make it an important component of the forest understory ecosystem."
