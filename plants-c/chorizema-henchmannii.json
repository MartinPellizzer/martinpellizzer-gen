    "intro": "Chorizema henchmannii, commonly known as the Henschmann's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are followed by small, fleshy fruits. Its structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well-suited for desert conditions. Chorizema henchmannii plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds."
