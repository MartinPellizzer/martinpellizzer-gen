It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It has a slow growth rate and requires well-drained soil and minimal water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
