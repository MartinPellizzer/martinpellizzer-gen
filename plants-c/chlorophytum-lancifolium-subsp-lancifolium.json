    "intro": "Chlorophytum lancifolium subsp. lancifolium, commonly known as the sword-shaped snake plant, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, sword-like leaves that are typically green with a prominent white midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, usually in late summer or early autumn. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ability to tolerate low light and air-purifying properties further enhance its appeal as a houseplant."
