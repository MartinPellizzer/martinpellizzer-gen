    "intro": "Coleus schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's coleus, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that range from red to orange and purple, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Coleus schlechteri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking foliage and ability to add visual interest to gardens and indoor spaces."
