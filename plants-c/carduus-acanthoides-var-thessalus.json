    "intro": "Carduus acanthoides var. thessalus, commonly known as the Thessalian thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features a robust, spiny stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with deeply lobed, silvery-green leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to violet composite flower heads, composed of numerous tiny florets, typically blooming from summer to autumn. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in traditional herbal medicine."
