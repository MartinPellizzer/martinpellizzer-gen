    "intro": "Crotonogynopsis, commonly known as the \"false croton,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of a single species, Crotonogynopsis glandulifera, which is native to the tropical regions of South America. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a type of specialized inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
