It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a distinctive rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native arid environment. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants like tomatoes and potatoes. Calea caleoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique flowering behavior."
