    "intro": "Cryptantha rugulosa, commonly known as the woolly cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its hairy stems and leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Cryptantha rugulosa is an important plant for pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of its native range."
