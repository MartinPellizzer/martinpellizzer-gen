    "intro": "Clusia deminuta, commonly known as the dwarf clusia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by bright orange or red berries. It is well adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Clusia deminuta is often used in landscaping for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its low maintenance requirements."
