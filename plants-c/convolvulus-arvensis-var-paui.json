    "intro": "Convolvulus arvensis var. paui, commonly known as the field bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, winding stems that often climb or trail along the ground, with heart-shaped leaves that are usually hairy. The flowers are small, trumpet-shaped, and typically pink or purple, blooming from late spring to early autumn. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water. This plant is often considered invasive in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth and deep root system."
