    "intro": "Centaurium leptophyllum, commonly known as slender centaury, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its delicate, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces slender, branching stems that support its showy inflorescences. Centaurium leptophyllum is often found in meadows and open woodlands at high elevations."
