    "intro": "Cereus perrottetii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to produce large, showy flowers at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and emit a fragrant scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Cereus perrottetii is a popular choice for desert gardens due to its low maintenance and striking appearance."
