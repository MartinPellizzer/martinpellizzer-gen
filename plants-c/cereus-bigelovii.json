It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is typically found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its flowering period occurs primarily during the spring and early summer. Cereus bigelovii is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
