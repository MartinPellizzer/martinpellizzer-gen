    "intro": "Cardiandra alternifolia, commonly known as the alternate-leaved heartleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, often heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and delicate blooms, making it a popular choice for gardens. However, it is relatively rare in cultivation and requires specific conditions to thrive."
