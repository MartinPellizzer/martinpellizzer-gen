    "intro": "Cinnamomum pauciflorum var. paxtonii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinnamon tree, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. Its bark is aromatic and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. This variant is less common than the typical form of Cinnamomum pauciflorum and is valued for its unique botanical features and potential economic uses."
