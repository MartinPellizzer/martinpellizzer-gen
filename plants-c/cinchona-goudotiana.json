    "intro": "Cinchona goudotiana, commonly known as the Goudot's quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen, lance-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant is notable for its bark, which contains alkaloids, including quinine, historically used in the treatment of malaria. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
