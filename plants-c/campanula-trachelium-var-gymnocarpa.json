It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its unique feature is the absence of a seed coat, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
