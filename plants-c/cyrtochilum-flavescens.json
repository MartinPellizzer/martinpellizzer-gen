    "intro": "Cyrtochilum flavescens, commonly known as the golden root orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid regions of Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with a short, fleshy rhizome and produces numerous small, fleshy pseudobulbs. The plant's flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive lip that is often spotted or streaked. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cyrtochilum flavescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
