    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. sempervirens, commonly known as the evergreen water fern, is a variant of the brittle bladder fern. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically green and often have a bluish tinge. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or near water sources. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while the sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. The species is notable for its ability to survive in wet conditions and its ornamental value in aquatic or bog garden settings."
