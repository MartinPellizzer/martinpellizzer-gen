It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats.
