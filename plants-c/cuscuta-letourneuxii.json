    "intro": "Cuscuta letourneuxii, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition. It produces small, yellow flowers and has a complex life cycle involving both seed and vegetative propagation. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called haustoria, which attach to the host and extract water and nutrients. It is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants in disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host species."
