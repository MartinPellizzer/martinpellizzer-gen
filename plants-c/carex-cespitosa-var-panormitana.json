    "intro": "Carex cespitosa var. panormitana, commonly known as the Panormitana sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, making it effective for erosion control. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
