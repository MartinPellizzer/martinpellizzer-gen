    "intro": "Cousinia franchetii, commonly known as the Tibetan fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of Central Asia, including regions of China, Mongolia, and Tibet. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of many small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cold, arid environments. Its yellow or white composite flowers bloom in summer, and the plant is often found in alpine meadows and steppe habitats. Cousinia franchetii is adapted to harsh conditions, with a compact growth form and hairy leaves that help reduce water loss."
