    "intro": "Croton klotzschii var. incanus, commonly known as the woolly croton, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Malaysia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, woolly appearance. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a pale underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by three-lobed, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage."
