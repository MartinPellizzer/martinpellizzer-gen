    "intro": "Cola subverticillata, commonly known as African cola, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly the rainforests of Central and West Africa. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. It produces hard, capsule-like fruits that contain stimulant-rich seeds, similar to the cola nuts of other Cola species. The plant is often cultivated for its seeds, which are used in the production of cola beverages and traditional medicinal preparations."
