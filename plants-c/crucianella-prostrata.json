    "intro": "Crucianella prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate sea bean, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is a small, herbaceous species that typically grows in coastal areas, particularly in sandy or muddy soils. The plant has prostrate or\u530d\u5310 (creeping) growth habit, with small, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. It is often found in intertidal zones and is adapted to saline environments. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody fruit, which helps in dispersal by water."
