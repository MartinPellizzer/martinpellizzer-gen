    "intro": "Cyclosorus richardsii, commonly known as the Richards' cyclosorus, is a small, perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a compact, rosette-like growth pattern with delicate, lance-shaped fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cyclosorus richardsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
