    "intro": "Carex phoenicis, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in heathlands and wet meadows. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex phoenicis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in wetland habitats."
