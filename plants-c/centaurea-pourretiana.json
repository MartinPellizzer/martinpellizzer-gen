    "intro": "Centaurea pourretiana, commonly known as the Pyrenean knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking purple to pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Centaurea pourretiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators in its native environment."
