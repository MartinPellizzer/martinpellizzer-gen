    "intro": "Corydalis haussknechtii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves and has a creeping rhizomatous growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
