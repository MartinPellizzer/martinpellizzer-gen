    "intro": "Cyrtorchis seretii, commonly known as the Seretii rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyrtorchis seretii is considered a vulnerable species."
