    "intro": "Calophyllum parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved calophyllum, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically small and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, berry-like fruits containing a single seed. It is often found in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
