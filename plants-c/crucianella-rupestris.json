    "intro": "Crucianella rupestris, commonly known as the rock crucianella, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically thrives in rocky, coastal or limestone habitats, where it forms dense mats or small colonies. The plant features small, glossy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
