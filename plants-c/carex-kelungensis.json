    "intro": "Carex kelungensis, commonly known as the Kelung sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. It produces small, clustered spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Carex kelungensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
