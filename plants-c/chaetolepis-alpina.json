    "intro": "Chaetolepis alpina, commonly known as the alpine hair-vine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid, high-altitude environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine meadows. Chaetolepis alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
