    "intro": "Chorizanthe cuspidata var. cuspidata, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The species is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
