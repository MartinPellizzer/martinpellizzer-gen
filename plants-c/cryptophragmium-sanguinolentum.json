    "intro": "Cryptophragmium sanguinolentum, commonly known as the blood-red cryptophragmium, is a unique member of the Lecanoraceae family within the lichenized fungi. It is characterized by its vivid reddish-orange thallus, which often displays a striking contrast with its dark, fissured cortex. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a specific photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga, enabling it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its distribution is largely restricted to temperate regions, where it grows on rock surfaces and tree bark. Due to its rarity and distinct coloration, it is of particular interest to mycologists and lichenologists."
