    "intro": "Cottendorfia cylindrostachya, commonly known as the slender-stemmed cottendorfia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
