    "intro": "Cousinia arakensis, commonly known as the Afghan cottonweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cousinia arakensis produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its survival in its native habitat."
