    "intro": "Castanea regia, commonly known as the royal chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces catkin-like male flowers and female flowers that develop into spiny, spherical fruits containing one or two edible nuts. Its nuts are encased in a thick, spiky husk and are typically harvested in the fall. Castanea regia is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical significance in traditional medicine and cuisine."
