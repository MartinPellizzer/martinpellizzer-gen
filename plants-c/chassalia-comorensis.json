It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
