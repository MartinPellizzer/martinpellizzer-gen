    "intro": "Campanula rupestris f. breueri, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to rocky habitats in Europe. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread and form dense, decorative ground cover."
