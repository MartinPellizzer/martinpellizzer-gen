    "intro": "Camissonia dentata subsp. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal toothplant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are typically narrow and toothed. It has adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This subspecies is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats, playing a role in stabilizing sandy environments."
