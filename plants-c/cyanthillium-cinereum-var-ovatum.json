    "intro": "Cyanthillium cinereum var. ovatum, commonly known as the silverleaf ironwood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features silvery-gray foliage due to dense, woolly hairs covering its leaves, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle floral display. Its woody stems are thick and rugged, providing structural support and contributing to its drought tolerance. This plant is well adapted to poor soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
