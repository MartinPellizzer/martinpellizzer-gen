    "intro": "Clethra mathewsii, commonly known as Mathews' sweet fern, is a rare shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its fragrant, white, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils in shaded woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
