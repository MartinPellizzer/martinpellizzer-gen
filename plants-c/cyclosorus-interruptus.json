    "intro": "Cyclosorus interruptus, commonly known as the interrupted cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Oleandraceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into narrow, thread-like segments. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and lakes, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. The species is noted for its unique leaf structure, which distinguishes it from other ferns in the same family."
