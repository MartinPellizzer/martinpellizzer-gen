    "intro": "Cornus longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled dogwood, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaf petioles, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Cornus longipetiolata is often grown as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and modest floral display."
