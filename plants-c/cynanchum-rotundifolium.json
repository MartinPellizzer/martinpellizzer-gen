    "intro": "Cynanchum rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaved milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and swamps."
