    "intro": "Cubanicula xanthorrhizos, commonly known as the golden root, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It features a rhizomatous root system that stores nutrients and helps the plant survive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating that aids in water retention. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds."
