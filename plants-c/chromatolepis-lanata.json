It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
