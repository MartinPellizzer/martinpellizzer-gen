It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture and a distinct central vein. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single terminal head, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. The species is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils."
