    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. ovatum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, gardens, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil."
