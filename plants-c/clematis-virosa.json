    "intro": "Clematis virosa, commonly known as the purple clematis, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It features climbing stems with stout, thornless tendrils that help it ascend supports. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of purple and blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. Clematis virosa thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
