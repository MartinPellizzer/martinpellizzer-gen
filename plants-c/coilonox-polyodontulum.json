    "intro": "Coilonox polyodontulum, commonly known as the toothed coilonox, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its hairy stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, with five petals and prominent stamens. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to habitat loss, Coilonox polyodontulum is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
