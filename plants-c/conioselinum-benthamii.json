It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in umbels. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
