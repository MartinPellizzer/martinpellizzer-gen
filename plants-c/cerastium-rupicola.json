    "intro": "Cerastium rupicola, commonly known as rock chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy, and often blue or purple flowers. The plant typically forms dense mats on rocky soils, with slender stems and small, oval leaves. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Cerastium rupicola is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
