    "intro": "Cynara algarbiensis f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered globe artichoke, is a rare and ornamental cultivar of the artichoke plant. It is characterized by its striking white flowers, which contrast with its dark green, velvety leaves. This variety originates from the Iberian Peninsula and is valued for its aesthetic appeal in gardens. The plant produces large, globe-shaped buds that are similar to the edible artichokes but are primarily grown for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a sunny location to flourish."
