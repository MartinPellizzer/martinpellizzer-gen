    "intro": "Campyloneurum juglandifolium, commonly known as the maple-leafed liverwort, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and dark green, overlapping leaves that resemble the shape of maple leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or on rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on stalks and release spores for propagation. This liverwort plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
