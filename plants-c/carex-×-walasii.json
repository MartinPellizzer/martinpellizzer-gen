    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 walasii, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Carex lyngbyei and Carex muricata, characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. The flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a three-parted perianth that facilitates wind pollination."
