It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
