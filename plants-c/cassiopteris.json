    "intro": "Cassiopteris, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, floating leaves that are often used in water gardens and as ornamental plants. Cassiopteris species typically thrive in shallow, still water environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Their fronds are usually pinnately divided, with a feathery appearance that enhances their aesthetic appeal. The genus is known for its ability to purify water and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms."
