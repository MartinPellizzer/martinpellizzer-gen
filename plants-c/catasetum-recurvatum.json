    "intro": "Catasetum recurvatum, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped inflorescence and striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are specialized for pollination by bees, featuring a modified lip that aids in pollinator attraction. Catasetum recurvatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or conservatories."
