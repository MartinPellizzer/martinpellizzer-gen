    "intro": "Chamaebetula rotundifolia, commonly known as the roundleaf birch, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and dark bark, which help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its flowers are catkins, typical of the Betulaceae family, and it produces small, winged fruits for seed dispersal. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
