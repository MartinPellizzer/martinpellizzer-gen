    "intro": "Clinelymus glaucus, commonly known as the silverleaf cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Clinelymus glaucus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
