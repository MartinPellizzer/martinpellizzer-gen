    "intro": "Cornus punctata, commonly known as the Chinese dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its showy, white or pink bracts that appear in late spring, often mistaken for flowers. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in umbels and are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Cornus punctata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
