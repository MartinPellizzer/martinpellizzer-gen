    "intro": "Cynanchum candolleanum, commonly known as the Indian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to regions of Asia, including India and China. It is a member of the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are yellowish-green with a distinctive, hooded structure, and it produces small, follicle-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores, though it plays a role in certain ecological interactions."
