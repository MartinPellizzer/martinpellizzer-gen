    "intro": "Cyperus albostriatus var. mossii, commonly known as the mossy flatsedge, is a member of the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has grass-like, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like in appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered at the base of the plant. This variety is distinguished by its pale green to white striped leaves, which give it its common name."
