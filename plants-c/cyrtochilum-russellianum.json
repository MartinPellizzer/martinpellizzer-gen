It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a sympodial growth habit with a short, rhizomatous stem and a single, fleshy pseudobulb. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and often have a distinctive claw-like shape, which gives it its common name.
