    "intro": "Coilonox subglandulosum, commonly known as the roughleaf coilonox, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
