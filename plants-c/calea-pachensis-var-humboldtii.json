    "intro": "Calea pachensis var. humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt's candleplant, is a striking tropical plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its tall, candle-like inflorescence composed of numerous white, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. The flowers emit a mild fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
