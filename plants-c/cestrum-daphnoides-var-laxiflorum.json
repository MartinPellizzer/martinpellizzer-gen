    "intro": "Cestrum daphnoides var. laxiflorum, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade or silver bells, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring broad, ovate leaves with a silvery underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil and full sun."
