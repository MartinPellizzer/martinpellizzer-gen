    "intro": "Chenopodium rubrum var. humile, commonly known as red sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It has prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are usually lobed or toothed, with a bluish-gray coloration due to a dense covering of fine hairs. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by dry, three-angled fruits. This plant is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
