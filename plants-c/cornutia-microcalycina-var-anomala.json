    "intro": "Cornutia microcalycina var. anomala, commonly known as the anomalous cornutia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and distinctive calyces that are shorter than the corolla. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a slightly hairy surface. This variant is notable for its morphological differences from the typical form of Cornutia microcalycina."
