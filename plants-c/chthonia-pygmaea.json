    "intro": "Chthonia pygmaea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant found in the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that grows close to the ground, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant has small, delicate leaves and produces tiny, pale green or white flowers that bloom briefly. Its unique appearance and habitat make it difficult to study, contributing to its mysterious reputation. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Chthonia pygmaea is considered endangered."
