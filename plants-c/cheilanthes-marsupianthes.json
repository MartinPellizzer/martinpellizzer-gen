    "intro": "Cheilanthes marsupianthes, commonly known as the rock cap fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and is often found growing on rocky substrates in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has thick, leathery fronds that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are typically clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. This fern is well adapted to harsh, rocky habitats and is often used as an indicator of stable, nutrient-poor environments."
