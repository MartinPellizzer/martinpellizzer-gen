    "intro": "Carima, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the genus *Dalbergia* in the legume family, Fabaceae, and is valued for its dense, dark-colored wood. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Carima is also known for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional medicine. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species."
