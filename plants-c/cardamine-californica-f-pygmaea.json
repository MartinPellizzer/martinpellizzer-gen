    "intro": "Cardamine californica f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf California watercress, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the moist, shaded environments of California's coastal regions. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length, arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in cool, humid conditions and is often found in streamside habitats and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species."
