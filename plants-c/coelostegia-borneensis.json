    "intro": "Coelostegia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean coelostegia, is a climbing vine native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its twining stems and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
