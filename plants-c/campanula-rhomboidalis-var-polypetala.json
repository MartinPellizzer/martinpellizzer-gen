    "intro": "Campanula rhomboidalis var. polypetala, commonly known as the polypetal bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to violet in color, with a distinctive, layered petal structure. The plant has lance-shaped to oval leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period, typically from late spring to early summer."
