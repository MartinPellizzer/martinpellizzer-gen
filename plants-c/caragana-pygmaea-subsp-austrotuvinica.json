    "intro": "Caragana pygmaea subsp. austrotuvinica, commonly known as the Tuvinian dwarf barberry, is a low-growing shrub native to Central Asia. It features small, compound leaves with three leaflets, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in early summer. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in steppe and semi-desert environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control in arid regions."
