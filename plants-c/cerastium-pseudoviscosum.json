    "intro": "Cerastium pseudoviscosum, commonly known as sticky chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and small, white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine, sticky hairs, which give it its common name. Cerastium pseudoviscosum produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its spread in suitable habitats."
