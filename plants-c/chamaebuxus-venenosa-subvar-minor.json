    "intro": "Chamaebuxus venenosa subvar. minor, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests coniferous trees such as pines and firs. It lacks true roots and instead attaches to its host via a specialized structure called a haustellum, which penetrates the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and promoting biodiversity through its interactions with other organisms. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to avoid contact with the plant and its berries."
