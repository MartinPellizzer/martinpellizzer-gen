    "intro": "Chascanum insulare var. humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's fireweed, is a variant of the fireweed plant native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in alpine ecosystems."
