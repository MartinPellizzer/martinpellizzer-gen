It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance.

It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and showy, bell-like blooms."
