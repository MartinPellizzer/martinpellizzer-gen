    "intro": "Cleistes catharinensis, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid or the white orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive, bell-shaped flower that is typically white or pale pink. The plant has a short, stocky stem and produces a single, showy bloom during the late summer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the acidic, nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, Cleistes catharinensis is critically endangered and is protected by conservation efforts in its native region."
