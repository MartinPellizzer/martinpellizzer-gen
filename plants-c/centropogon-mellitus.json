It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its flowers are rich in nectar, making it an important pollinator attractant, particularly for bees and hummingbirds. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
