    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. coniformis, commonly known as the European hazel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are hairy when young. The plant produces catkin-like male flowers and female flowers in separate clusters, with the latter developing into hazelnuts. Its conical shape and upright growth habit make it a distinctive ornamental plant. The nuts are edible and have been used historically for food and crafts."
