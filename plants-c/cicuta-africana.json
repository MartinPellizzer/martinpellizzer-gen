    "intro": "Cicuta africana, commonly known as African water hemlock, is a toxic flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, but it is highly poisonous due to the presence of cicutoxin. The plant has a tall, hollow stem with finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white flowers that appear in umbrella-like clusters. It typically grows near water sources and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its extreme toxicity, it should never be handled or ingested without proper knowledge and protective equipment."
