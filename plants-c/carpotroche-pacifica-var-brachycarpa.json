    "intro": "Carpotroche pacifica var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the Pacific brachycarpa, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky stream banks. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
