    "intro": "Cleistocactus roezlii, commonly known as the R\u00f6tzli's close-cushion cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Bolivia. It is a small, columnar cactus with a distinctive rib structure and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom at night, a characteristic feature of many nocturnal cacti. Its unique morphology and habitat make it well adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions. Due to its rarity and specific environmental requirements, it is often found in protected areas and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
