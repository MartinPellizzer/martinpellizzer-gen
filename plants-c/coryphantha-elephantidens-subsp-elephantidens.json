    "intro": "Coryphantha elephantidens subsp. elephantidens, commonly known as the elephant's teeth cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a swollen, ribbed stem that resembles the shape of an elephant's teeth. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This subspecies is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique morphology and resilience."
