    "intro": "Cordylanthus littoralis, commonly known as the saltbush or coastal saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its small, green, succulent leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline conditions. Cordylanthus littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
