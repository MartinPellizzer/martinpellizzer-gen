    "intro": "Cynometra vestita, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sterculiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and is used in furniture and carving, though the plant is also appreciated for its ornamental qualities. Cynometra vestita thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
