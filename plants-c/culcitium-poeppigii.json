It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often resembling those of the hibiscus genus. The plant has succulent leaves and stems, which help it conserve water in dry environments. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Culcitium poeppigii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, desert-like conditions."
