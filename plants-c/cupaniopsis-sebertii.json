    "intro": "Cupaniopsis sebertii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and tableland regions. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in timber, it is also of ecological and cultural significance."
