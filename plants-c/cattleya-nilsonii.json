    "intro": "Cattleya nilsonii, commonly known as the Nilson's Cattleya, is a tropical orchid native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It features large, showy flowers with vibrant purple and white petals, often adorned with intricate markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Cattleya nilsonii is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its striking beauty and relatively hardy nature compared to other orchid species."
