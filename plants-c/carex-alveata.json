    "intro": "Carex alveata, commonly known as the alveate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in poorly drained soils. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, consist of small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex alveata plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
