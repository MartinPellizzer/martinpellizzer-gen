    "intro": "Centaurea leucophaea subsp. reuteri, commonly known as the white-centred knapweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant features erect, branching stems with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, bright yellow to orange flowers arranged in composite inflorescences. Its flowers are often surrounded by white or pale blue bracts, giving it its common name. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
