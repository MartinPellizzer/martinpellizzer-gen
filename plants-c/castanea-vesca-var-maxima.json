    "intro": "Castanea vesca var. maxima, commonly known as the giant horse chestnut. It is a variant of the common horse chestnut, characterized by its larger size and more robust growth compared to the standard species. The plant produces large, showy white flowers in late spring, followed by spiny, capsule-like fruits that contain edible nuts. Its leaves are broad, palmately lobed, and provide dense shade, making it a popular ornamental tree. However, it is less cold-hardy than other chestnut species and is often cultivated in temperate climates."
