    "intro": "Cyclosorus wollastonii, commonly known as the Wollaston's water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in shallow, freshwater environments. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, rounded lobes, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in still or slow-moving water bodies. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in ponds and water gardens."
