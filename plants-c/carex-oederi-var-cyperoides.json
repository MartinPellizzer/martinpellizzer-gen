    "intro": "Carex oederi var. cyperoides, commonly known as Oeder's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Oeder's sedge is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic wildlife."
