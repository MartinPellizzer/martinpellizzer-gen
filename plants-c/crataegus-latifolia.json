    "intro": "Crataegus latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves, and clusters of white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Crataegus latifolia is often found in moist woodlands, stream banks, and other well-drained soils, and it plays a significant role in ecological systems."
