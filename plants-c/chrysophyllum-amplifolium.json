    "intro": "Chrysophyllum amplifolium, commonly known as the large-leaf chrysophyllum, is a tropical evergreen tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible fruits resembling small, round oranges. The fruit's pulp is sweet and juicy, while the seeds are enclosed in a hard, woody shell. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in some indigenous cultures."
