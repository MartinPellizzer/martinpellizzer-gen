    "intro": "Colobogynium variegatum, commonly known as the variegated colobogynium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its strikingly variegated leaves, which display a mix of green, white, and yellow hues. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
