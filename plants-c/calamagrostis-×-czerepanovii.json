    "intro": "Calamagrostis \u00d7 czerepanovii, commonly known as 'Karl Foerster' switchgrass, is a tall, ornamental grass native to North America. It features upright, slender blades that can grow up to 6 feet in height, with a silver-green coloration that turns golden in autumn. The plant produces feathery plumes in late summer, adding visual interest to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its fine texture and architectural form make it a popular choice for landscape design."
