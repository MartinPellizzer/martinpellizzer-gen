    "intro": "Camellia pubicosta, commonly known as the woolly camellia, is a flowering plant native to southern China and northern Vietnam. It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, double-flowered blooms in shades of red, pink, and white during late winter to early spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Camellia pubicosta is also valued for its cold hardiness and ability to bloom reliably in cooler climates."
