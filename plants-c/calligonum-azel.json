    "intro": "Calligonum azel, commonly known as the desert flax, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it valuable for erosion control. Calligonum azel is also known for its ability to thrive in harsh, saline environments."
