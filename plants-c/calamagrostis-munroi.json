    "intro": "Calamagrostis munroi, commonly known as the Munro's reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the wetlands of North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, feathery seed heads that are often visible in late summer and early autumn. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which helps in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Calamagrostis munroi is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ecological benefits and aesthetic appeal."
