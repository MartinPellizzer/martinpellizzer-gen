    "intro": "Cleidion viridiflorum, commonly known as the green-flowered cleidium, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are typically borne on the stems rather than the branches. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in traditional medicine."
