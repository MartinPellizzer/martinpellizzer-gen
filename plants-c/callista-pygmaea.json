    "intro": "Callista pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf lily or pygmy lily, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it a striking addition to small garden spaces. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clusters over time. Callista pygmaea thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade."
