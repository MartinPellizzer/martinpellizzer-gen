It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Crotalaria divergens is also noted for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain environments."
