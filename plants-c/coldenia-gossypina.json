    "intro": "[WRONG START] Coldownia gossypina, commonly known as the cottonleaf or woolly bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with woody stems and dense, hairy foliage. The leaves are usually ovate or elliptical, with a velvety texture due to the presence of fine hairs. It produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to semi-arid conditions."
