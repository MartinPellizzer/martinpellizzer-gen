    "intro": "Conyza pratensis, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, inconspicuous yellow flowers and hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and fields. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it produces numerous small seeds that are easily dispersed. Conyza pratensis is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
