    "intro": "Cuphea anamariae, commonly known as the velvet tassel plant, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Lythraceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink. The plant features fuzzy, velvety foliage that gives it its common name, and it produces long, drooping clusters of blooms. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Cuphea anamariae is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a low-maintenance choice for landscapers and gardeners."
