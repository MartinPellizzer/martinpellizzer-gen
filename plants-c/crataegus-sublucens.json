It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by red berries in the autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.
