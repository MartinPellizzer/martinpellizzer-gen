    "intro": "Cleistanthus oblongatus, commonly known as the broadleaf sycamore, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are often glossy and have a leathery texture. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Cleistanthus oblongatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its attractive foliage and shade-providing canopy."
