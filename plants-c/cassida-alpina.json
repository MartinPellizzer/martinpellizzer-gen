    "intro": "Cassida alpina, commonly known as the alpine ladybird plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, delicate yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. Cassida alpina prefers well-drained, rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and alpine plantings."
