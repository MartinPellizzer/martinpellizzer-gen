It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. Its flowering spikes are usually small and inconspicuous, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
