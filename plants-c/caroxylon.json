    "intro": "Caroxylon, commonly known as the desert willow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water conservation. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Caroxylon plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
