    "intro": "Cactus clavus, commonly known as the knob cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its spines provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through transpiration. The cactus clavus is often used in traditional medicine for its potential healing properties."
