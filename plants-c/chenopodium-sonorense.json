    "intro": "Chenopodium sonorense, commonly known as desert goosefoot, is a shrub native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Chenopodium sonorense is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability."
