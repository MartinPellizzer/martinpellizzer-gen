It is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open plains. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is well adapted to drought conditions."
