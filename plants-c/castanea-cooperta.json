    "intro": "Castanea cooperta, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its alternate, simple leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers in spring, followed by spiny, cup-like fruits that enclose edible nuts. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance, while its roots are deep and strong, making it adaptable to various soil types. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in traditional medicine."
