    "intro": "Centrapalus subaphyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf centrapalus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
