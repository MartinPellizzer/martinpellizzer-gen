    "intro": "Carex austroalpina, commonly known as the Alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine and subalpine habitats. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often green or brown in color, and it is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Carex austroalpina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms."
