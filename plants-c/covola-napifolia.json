    "intro": "Covola napifolia, commonly known as the golden bell vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble small bells, which bloom in clusters along its vine-like stems. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are opposite in arrangement, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Covola napifolia is often cultivated for its vibrant floral display and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
