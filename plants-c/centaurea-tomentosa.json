    "intro": "Centaurea tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its hairy leaves and bristly stems are adaptations to reduce water loss in arid environments. Centaurea tomentosa is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
