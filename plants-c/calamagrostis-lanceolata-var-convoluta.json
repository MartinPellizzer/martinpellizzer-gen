    "intro": "Calamagrostis lanceolata var. convoluta, commonly known as the curled reed grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curled at the tips. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It prefers moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ability to thrive in wet conditions and its attractive, feathery appearance."
