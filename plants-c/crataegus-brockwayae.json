    "intro": "Crataegus brockwayae, commonly known as the Brockway hawthorn, is a rare and endemic species native to the United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky soils in mountainous regions. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the spring. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
