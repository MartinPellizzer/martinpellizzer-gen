    "intro": "Cladium ouveanum, commonly known as the Ouvean marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat creation for various aquatic organisms."
