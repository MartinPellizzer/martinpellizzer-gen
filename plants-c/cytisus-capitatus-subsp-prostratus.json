    "intro": "Cytisus capitatus subsp. prostratus, commonly known as creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover."
