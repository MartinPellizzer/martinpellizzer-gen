    "intro": "Calycorectes fluminensis, commonly known as the Brazilian water lily, is a aquatic plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Nymphaeaceae and is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, white to pink flowers. The plant has a submersed root system that anchors it in shallow water, while its leaves provide surface coverage. Its flowers open in the morning and close at dusk, a trait common among many water lilies. Calycorectes fluminensis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
