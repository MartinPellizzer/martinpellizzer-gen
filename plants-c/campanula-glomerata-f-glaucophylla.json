    "intro": "Campanula glomerata f. glaucophylla, commonly known as the glaucophyll form of clustered bellflower, is a compact, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It features dense clusters of sky-blue to white bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically hairy and have a bluish-gray hue, which is characteristic of the 'glaucophylla' cultivar. This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
