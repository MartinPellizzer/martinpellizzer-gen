    "intro": "Concocidium concolor, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many agricultural areas."
