    "intro": "Clidemia neglecta var. squarrosa, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it attaches to a host plant and derives some of its nutrients from it while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with a velvety, hairy texture, and its flowers are typically white or pale green. It produces small, fleshy berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. Due to its parasitic nature and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but can be invasive in certain ecosystems."
