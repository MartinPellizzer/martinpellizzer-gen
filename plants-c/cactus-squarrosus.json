    "intro": "Cactus squarrosus, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is shallow and adapted to absorb moisture quickly from infrequent rains. Overall, Cactus squarrosus exhibits typical adaptations for survival in harsh, desert-like environments."
