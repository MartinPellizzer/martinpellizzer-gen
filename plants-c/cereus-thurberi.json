    "intro": "Cereus thurberi, commonly known as the Thornless Moon Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the deserts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, a trait common among many cacti. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it is adapted to thrive in arid environments with minimal water. Cereus thurberi is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
