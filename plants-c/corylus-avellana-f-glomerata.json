It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and the production of tightly clustered female flowers. The plant is typically shrub-like, with slender, twisted branches and dark green, ovate leaves. It produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which ripen in the fall. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible nuts in small-scale agriculture."
