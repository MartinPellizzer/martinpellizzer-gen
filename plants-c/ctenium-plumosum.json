    "intro": "Ctenium plumosum, commonly known as the silky ctenium, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has feathery, hairy leaves that give it a soft, delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. Ctenium plumosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flowering display."
