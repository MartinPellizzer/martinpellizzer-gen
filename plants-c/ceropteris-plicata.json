    "intro": "Ceropteris plicata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating in still or slow-moving water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often forming dense mats on the bottom of water bodies. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive plicate (folded) appearance on the underside. Ceropteris plicata plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation."
