    "intro": "Clematoclethra oliviformis, commonly known as the oliveleaf clethra, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Clethraceae and is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically a glossy green. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution in woodland habitats. Clematoclethra oliviformis is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
