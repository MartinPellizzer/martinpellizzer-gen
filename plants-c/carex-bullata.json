    "intro": "Carex bullata, commonly known as the bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are generally narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. Carex bullata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
