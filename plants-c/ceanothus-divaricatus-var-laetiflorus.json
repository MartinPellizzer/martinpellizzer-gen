    "intro": "Ceanothus divaricatus var. laetiflorus, commonly known as the showy ceanothus, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features dense, dark green foliage and produces clusters of fragrant, blue to violet flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to various garden settings. Its ornamental value comes from its showy blooms and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is also valued for its role in stabilizing soils in dry, rocky habitats."
