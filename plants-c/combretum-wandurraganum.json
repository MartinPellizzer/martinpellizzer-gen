    "intro": "Combretum wandurraganum, commonly known as the Wandurraganum bush, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
