    "intro": "Cucumis cubensis var. costatus, commonly known as the Cuban cucumber, is a unique variant of the Cucumis genus native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its elongated, ridged fruit that typically measures between 15 to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a vine-like growth habit, often climbing or trailing along the ground. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a distinct texture that aids in photosynthesis. The fruit is typically harvested when it turns from green to a pale yellow or white, indicating maturity."
