    "intro": "Crataegus brevispina var. contracta, commonly known as the compact thorned hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. The variety 'contracta' is distinguished by its shorter thorns compared to other forms of Crataegus brevispina."
