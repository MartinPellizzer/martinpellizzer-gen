    "intro": "Chondrorhyncha fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in temperate regions. It possesses small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest aquatic invertebrates. The plant has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that help it float and maximize its exposure to prey. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with four petals and a distinctive spurred shape. It thrives in still or slow-moving water and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations."
