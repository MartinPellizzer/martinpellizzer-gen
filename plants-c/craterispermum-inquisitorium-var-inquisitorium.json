    "intro": "Craterispermum inquisitorium var. inquisitorium, commonly known as the \"Inquisitor's Spur,\" is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from deep red to violet, which are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The species is noted for its unique floral structure, which has led to its common name and has made it a subject of botanical interest."
