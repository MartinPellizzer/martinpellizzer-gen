    "intro": "Carex lepidocarpa subsp. lepidocarpa, commonly known as the woolly sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. The subspecies is distinguished by its densely hairy leaves and a compact, rounded growth habit."
