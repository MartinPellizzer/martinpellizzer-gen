    "intro": "Cuscuta europaea var. europaea, commonly known as the European dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is often found growing on crops such as wheat, barley, and legumes, making it a significant agricultural pest. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread widely across different regions. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in certain ecosystems by influencing host plant populations and providing food for some insect species."
