    "intro": "Chelone glabra var. dilatata, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and moist soils in eastern North America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces striking clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires consistent moisture. Its botanical name reflects its smooth (glabra) stems and the expanded (dilatata) leaf bases."
