    "intro": "Chamaecrista stenocarpoides, commonly known as the narrow-carpel crownflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny pods and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces showy, crown-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance and visual interest."
