    "intro": "[WRONG START] COLDENIA ATACAMENSIS, commonly known as the Atacama coldenia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Chile. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Coldenia atacamensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its harsh environment."
