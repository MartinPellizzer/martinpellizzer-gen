    "intro": "Cerastium hirsutum, commonly known as hairy mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white trichomes. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky areas. Cerastium hirsutum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
