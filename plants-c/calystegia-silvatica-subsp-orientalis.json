It features heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue to violet in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure and habitat preferences compared to the main species."
