It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters, with narrow, erect leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting a variety of invertebrates and birds."
