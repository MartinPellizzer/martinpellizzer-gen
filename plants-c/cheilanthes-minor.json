    "intro": "Cheilanthes minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to arid and rocky environments in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has a compact, cushion-like growth habit with short, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its fronds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. Cheilanthes minor is often found growing on limestone or sandstone, thriving in well-drained, sunny habitats."
