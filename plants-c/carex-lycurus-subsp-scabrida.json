It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes are usually pale green to brown, and the plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
