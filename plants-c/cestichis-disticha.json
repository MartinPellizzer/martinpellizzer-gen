    "intro": "Cestichis disticha, commonly known as the two-branched cestichis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive two-branched growth pattern. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
