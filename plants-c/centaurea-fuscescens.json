    "intro": "Centaurea fuscescens, commonly known as the purplehead thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features spiny, glandular stems and basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers arranged in a single, terminal head, which are visited by various pollinators. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Centaurea fuscescens is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
