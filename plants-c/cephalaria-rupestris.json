It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions, and thrives in full sun. Its slender stems and small, tubular flowers are adapted to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cephalaria rupestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
