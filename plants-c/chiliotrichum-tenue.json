    "intro": "Chiliotrichum tenue, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in tiny, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and wetland landscapes."
