    "intro": "Couroupita venezuelensis, commonly known as the Venezuelan starfruit or yellow starfruit, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and broad, ovate leaves. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to edible, star-shaped fruits with a sweet, tangy flavor. Its fruits are often consumed fresh or used in jams and preserves. The plant is valued not only for its fruit but also for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal uses."
