    "intro": "Crawfurdia thibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan crawfurdia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including parts of China, India, and Nepal. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and showy, often trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Crawfurdia thibetica is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species in botanical studies."
