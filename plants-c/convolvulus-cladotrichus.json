It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds with a distinctive, hairy coating. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens, though it can become invasive if not controlled."
