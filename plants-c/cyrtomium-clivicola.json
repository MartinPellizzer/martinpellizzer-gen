    "intro": "Cyrtomium clivicola, commonly known as the cliff brake fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact, mat-like growth. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its fronds are leathery and have a distinct, segmented appearance, with spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside. Cyrtomium clivicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a decorative plant in shaded environments."
