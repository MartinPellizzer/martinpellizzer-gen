    "intro": "Cereus chiotilla, commonly known as the Chiotilla candleplant, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which open at night. It thrives in arid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming make it a striking addition to xeriscaped gardens."
