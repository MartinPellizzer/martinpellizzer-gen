    "intro": "Chaetanthera nana, commonly known as dwarf chaetanthera, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is part of the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its umbel-like flower clusters. Due to its delicate appearance and habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
