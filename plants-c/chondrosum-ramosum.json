    "intro": "Chondrosum ramosum, commonly known as the clustered cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It forms dense, cushion-like clusters of succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the short growing season. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which provides structural support and reduces water loss. Chondrosum ramosum is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
