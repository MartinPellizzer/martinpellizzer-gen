    "intro": "Carex ferruginea f. crassispica, commonly known as the rusty sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with dark reddish-brown bracts, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, arranged in spike-like inflorescences. The variety *crassispica* is distinguished by its broader, more robust leaves compared to the typical form of *Carex ferruginea*."
