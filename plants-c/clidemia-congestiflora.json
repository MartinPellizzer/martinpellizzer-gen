    "intro": "Clidemia congestiflora, commonly known as the Hawaiian miltweed, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that are often grouped in dense clusters, giving it its species name *congestiflora*. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Clidemia congestiflora is an important component of native Hawaiian ecosystems, though it is considered an invasive species in some areas."
