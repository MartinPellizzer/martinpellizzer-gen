    "intro": "Claytonia floribunda, commonly known as the spring beauty, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features rosettes of oval, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Claytonia floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in woodland habitats."
