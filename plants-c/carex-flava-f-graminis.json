    "intro": "Carex flava f. graminis, commonly known as the yellow sedge, is a variant of the common yellow sedge, characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wet meadows or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of yellowish-green spikelets, which are usually concealed by the foliage. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wetland environments."
