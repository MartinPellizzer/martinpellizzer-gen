    "intro": "Cephalocarpus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid-headed caryopsis, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its unique, rigid, and often spiny seed heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are followed by dry, indehiscent fruits called caryopses. Cephalocarpus rigidus is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its distinctive appearance."
