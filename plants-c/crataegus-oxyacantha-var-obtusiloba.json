    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha var. obtusiloba, commonly known as the blunt-leaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of white flowers that appear in spring. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a blunt or rounded tip, giving it its varietal name. Its fruit is a red, juicy berry that ripens in the fall and is often consumed by birds and small mammals. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
