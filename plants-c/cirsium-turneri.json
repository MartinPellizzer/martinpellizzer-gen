    "intro": "Cirsium turneri, commonly known as the Turner's thistle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and large, woolly leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces purple to pinkish-blue flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a dense, spherical cluster. Cirsium turneri is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological studies due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences."
