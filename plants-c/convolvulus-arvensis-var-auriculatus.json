    "intro": "Convolvulus arvensis var. auriculatus, commonly known as the auriculate field bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers. It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, with hairy stems that often root at the nodes. Its flowers, typically pink or purple, bloom from late spring to early autumn, and the plant is known for its rapid spread through both seeds and rhizomes. It is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings due to its aggressive growth and persistence."
