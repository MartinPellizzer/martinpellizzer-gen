    "intro": "Chilopogon kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu spike moss, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the family Lejeuneaceae, which includes liverworts and related mosses, and is characterized by its small, delicate, and often sparsely branched structure. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates at high elevations, where it thrives in the cool, moist conditions of the montane rainforest. Its morphology includes a short stem with leaf-like structures that are often clustered closely together. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chilopogon kinabaluensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in protecting its unique ecological niche."
