    "intro": "Cynosurus distachyos, commonly known as silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, two-flowered spikelets that are typically arranged in compact clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Cynosurus distachyos is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
