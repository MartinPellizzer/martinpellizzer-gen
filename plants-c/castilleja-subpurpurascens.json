    "intro": "Castilleja subpurpurascens, commonly known as the purplestem Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients through its specialized roots. The plant is characterized by its showy, reddish-orange bract-like flowers that resemble paintbrush strokes. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health."
