    "intro": "Cumulopuntia recurvata, commonly known as the mountain cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, branching stems covered in small, spine-tipped tubercles. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Cumulopuntia recurvata is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for desert landscapes."
