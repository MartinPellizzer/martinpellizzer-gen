It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest size. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on tropical flora and ecological interactions."
