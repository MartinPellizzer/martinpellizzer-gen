    "intro": "Cerasus obtusata, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or Prunus obtusata, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are ovate with a rounded base and are covered in a fine, silvery down. Cerasus obtusata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms."
