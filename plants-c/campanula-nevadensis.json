    "intro": "Campanula nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, such as meadows and slopes, and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It has hairy leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Campanula nevadensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
