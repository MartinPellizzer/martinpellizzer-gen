    "intro": "Cyrtochilum mezae, commonly known as the Mezae orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-white or pale yellow flowers with prominent lips, which are adapted for specific pollinators. Cyrtochilum mezae thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
