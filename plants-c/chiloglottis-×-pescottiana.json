    "intro": "Chiloglottis \u00d7 pescottiana, commonly known as the Pescott's duckbill, is a unique hybrid orchid native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated greenish-brown pseudobulbs and its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in understorey habitats. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its native region. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
