    "intro": "Carduus dahuricus, commonly known as Siberian thistle, is a flowering plant native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny stems. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped, rough, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds."
