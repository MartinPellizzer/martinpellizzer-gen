    "intro": "Cymbachne ciliata var. toumodiensis, commonly known as the toumodien grass, is a perennial grass species native to West Africa. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and fine, hairy leaves that are often covered with ciliate margins. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for soil stabilization and as a forage plant in arid regions."
