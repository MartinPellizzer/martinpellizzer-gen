It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine environments, thriving in high-altitude regions. It has a low-growing habit with woolly, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small yellow flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
