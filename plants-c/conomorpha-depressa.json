    "intro": "Conomorpha depressa, commonly known as the lowland marsh orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in South America. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters and features slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and often forms dense colonies in its native environment. Conomorpha depressa is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
