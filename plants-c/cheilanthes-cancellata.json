It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically gray-green in color. This plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone. The plant's ability to retain moisture in its rhizomes allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments."
