    "intro": "Cornus alba var. nitida, commonly known as the silver leaf dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the forests of eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking silver-white, velvety leaves that provide a dramatic visual contrast in the landscape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or pink berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its aesthetic appeal. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for borders, hedges, or as a specimen plant in gardens."
