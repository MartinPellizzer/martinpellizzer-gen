    "intro": "Capsella viridis, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a small annual flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops like cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and small white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive triangular capsule, which splits open to release the seeds when mature. Capsella viridis is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
