    "intro": "Cardamine nasturtioides, commonly known as narrowleaf watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a peppery aroma, and small white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in wet soils along stream banks and forest floors, often forming dense mats. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently. Despite its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is valued for its edible leaves and medicinal properties."
