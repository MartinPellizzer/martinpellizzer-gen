    "intro": "Caralluma petraea, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of India and Africa. It is a succulent shrub that thrives in hot, dry climates and is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. It is adapted to store water in its thick leaves and stems, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. Caralluma petraea is also known for its traditional use in herbal medicine."
