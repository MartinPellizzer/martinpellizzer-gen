    "intro": "Claytonia multiscapa subsp. pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific spring beauty, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native habitat."
