    "intro": "Convolvulus pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf morning glory, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, winding stems that climb or trail along the ground, often forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming in the morning and closing in the heat of the day. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Convolvulus pusillus is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
