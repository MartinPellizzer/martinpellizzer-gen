    "intro": "Chamaefistula laevigata, commonly known as the European spindle tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It features smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles during late spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
