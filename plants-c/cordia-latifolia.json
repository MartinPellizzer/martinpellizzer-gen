    "intro": "Cordia latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf cordia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Cordia latifolia is often found in coastal areas and can thrive in sandy or saline soils. Its rapid growth and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
