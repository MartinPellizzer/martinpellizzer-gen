    "intro": "Carex sanjappae, commonly known as the Sanjappae sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants commonly found in moist or wet environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in shaded, humid habitats such as forest floors or stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
