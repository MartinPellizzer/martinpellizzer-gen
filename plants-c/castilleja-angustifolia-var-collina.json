    "intro": "Castilleja angustifolia var. collina, commonly known as narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its bright red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, often hairy stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, often growing in association with other plants. Its root system allows it to partially parasitize the roots of neighboring plants, drawing nutrients and water from them."
