    "intro": "Castilleja affinis subsp. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal castilleja, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific coast of North America. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in coastal grasslands and dunes, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
