    "intro": "Chaetogastra pendula, commonly known as the hanging hair-vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in terminal inflorescences. Its fibrous roots and flexible stems make it well-suited for climbing and trailing growth. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
