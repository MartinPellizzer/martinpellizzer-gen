    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans var. bosniacum, commonly known as the Bosnian mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in parts of its native range."
