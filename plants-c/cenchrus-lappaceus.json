    "intro": "Cenchrus lappaceus, commonly known as the hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to warm temperate and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Cenchrus lappaceus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its hardy nature."
