It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are leathery and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the delicate flowers. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and air-purifying properties."
