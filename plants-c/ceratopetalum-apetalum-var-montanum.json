    "intro": "Ceratopetalum apetalum var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, leathery, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to rocky, well-drained soils, making it drought-tolerant. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
