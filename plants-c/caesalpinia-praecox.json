    "intro": "Caesalpinia praecox, commonly known as the early flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant red and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the leaves. The plant has bipinnate leaves, with each leaflet being small and oval-shaped. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open when mature. Caesalpinia praecox is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
