    "intro": "Costus maritimus, commonly known as sea costus, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and southern United States. It features tall, slender stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in sandy, saline soils along shorelines. Costus maritimus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
