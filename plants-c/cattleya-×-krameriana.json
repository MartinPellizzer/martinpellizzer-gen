    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 krameriana, commonly known as the Kramer's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. It produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Cattleya \u00d7 krameriana is prized by orchid growers for its fragrance and long-lasting blooms."
