    "intro": "Celiantha bella, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a striking perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
