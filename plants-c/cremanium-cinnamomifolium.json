    "intro": "Cremanium cinnamomifolium, commonly known as the cinnamon-leaf cremanium, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of cinnamon trees, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale yellow, and it produces small, red berries that are edible. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its attractive foliage and fragrance."
