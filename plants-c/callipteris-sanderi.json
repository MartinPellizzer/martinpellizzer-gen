    "intro": "Callipteris sanderi, commonly known as the sand cordgrass, is a coastal grass native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial plant that thrives in sandy and well-drained soils, often found in dune environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring. It plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind makes it a key species in coastal ecosystems."
