    "intro": "Carduus macranthus, commonly known as the giant thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, spiny leaves and showy purple or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to heights of 1 to 3 meters, making it a striking feature in its natural habitat. Its leaves are covered in stiff, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family."
