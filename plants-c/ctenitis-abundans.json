    "intro": "Ctenitis abundans, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hemionitidaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments, giving it a lacy appearance. This plant typically grows on rocky substrates in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in humid environments and is often found in shaded, moist areas. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns."
