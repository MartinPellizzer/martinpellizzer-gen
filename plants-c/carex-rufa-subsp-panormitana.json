    "intro": "Carex rufa subsp. panormitana, commonly known as the red sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear brownish to reddish flowers. Native to southern Europe, this subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for various wildlife. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
