    "intro": "Conchocarpus longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved conchocarpus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its woody structure and showy flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with elongated, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with five petals and stamens that are often longer than the petals. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in natural habitats."
