    "intro": "Calamagrostis pseudophragmites var. minor, commonly known as the narrowleaf sweetgrass, is a grass species native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, releasing light green to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in riparian zones and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wetland biodiversity."
