    "intro": "Crotalaria kutchiensis, commonly known as Kutch crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of India, particularly the state of Gujarat. It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters. The plant features palmately lobed leaves and produces yellow flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny pod, which aids in seed dispersal. Crotalaria kutchiensis is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in wastelands and along roadsides."
