    "intro": "Calyptrogyne clementis, commonly known as the Clement's sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in mangrove swamps and tidal flats. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss in its coastal habitat. Calyptrogyne clementis plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
