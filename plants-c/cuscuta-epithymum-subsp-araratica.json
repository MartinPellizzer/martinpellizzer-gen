    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum subsp. araratica, commonly known as the red root dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth pattern, often forming dense mats on its host plants. The plant is native to regions of North America and is typically found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can become invasive in certain ecosystems. The subspecies araratica is distinguished by its reddish stem color and specific host preferences."
