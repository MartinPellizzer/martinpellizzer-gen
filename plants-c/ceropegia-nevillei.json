    "intro": "Ceropegia nevillei, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that are often pale green or white, which help it blend into its natural surroundings. The plant has thin, trailing stems and small, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-like plants. Ceropegia nevillei is often grown as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
