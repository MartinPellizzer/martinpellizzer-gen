It is characterized by its striking bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardeners.
