    "intro": "Chevaliera conifera, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that remain green throughout the year. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Chevaliera conifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to persist through harsh winter conditions."
