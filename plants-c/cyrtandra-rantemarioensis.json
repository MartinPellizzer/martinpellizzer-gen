    "intro": "Cyrtandra rantemarioensis, commonly known as the Rantemariou Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the island of Rantemariou in the French archipelago of Saint-Martin. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and often hairy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
