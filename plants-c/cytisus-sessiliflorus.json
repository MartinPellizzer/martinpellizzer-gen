It features slender, often spiny stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a distinctive reddish or purple underside. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and rocky habitats. The plant is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
