    "intro": "Carex canina subsp. canina, commonly known as dog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The subspecies canina is distinguished by its narrow leaves and the presence of a short, conical stem."
