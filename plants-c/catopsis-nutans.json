    "intro": "Catopsis nutans, commonly known as the hanging moss, is a type of epiphytic plant belonging to the family Restionaceae. It is native to South America, particularly in regions with humid climates. This plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its small, clustered leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Catopsis nutans is well adapted to low-light conditions and is often found in tropical and subtropical environments."
