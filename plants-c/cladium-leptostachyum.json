    "intro": "Cladium leptostachyum, commonly known as the narrow-stalked sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender, branching stalks. Cladium leptostachyum thrives in saturated soils and plays a crucial role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland habitats."
