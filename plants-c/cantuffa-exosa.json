    "intro": "Cantuffa exosa, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late summer. Its berries are typically red or yellow when mature and are edible but should be consumed with caution. The species is known for its adaptability to arid conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
