    "intro": "Ceterach ceterach, commonly known as the red seaweed or red laver, is a species of red algae found in marine environments. It thrives in intertidal zones, particularly in rocky substrates along the coasts of the North Atlantic. The plant has a distinctive dark red to purple coloration, which is due to its high concentration of pigments like phycoerythrin. It reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, with spores dispersing through the water. Ceterach ceterach plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
