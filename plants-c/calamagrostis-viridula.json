    "intro": "Calamagrostis viridula, commonly known as green moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, upright stems that are often tinged with purple at the base, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which are small, clustered flower clusters. Calamagrostis viridula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect and bird life."
