It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, feather-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
