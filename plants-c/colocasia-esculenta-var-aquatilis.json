    "intro": "Colocasia esculenta var. aquatilis, commonly known as water taro, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features large, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted for life in wet environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often submerged, followed by spathes that enclose the fruit. It thrives in shallow water, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly."
