    "intro": "Chusua roborowskyi var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf chusua, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
