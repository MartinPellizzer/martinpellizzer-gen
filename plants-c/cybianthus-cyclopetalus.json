    "intro": "Cybianthus cyclopetalus, commonly known as the cyclops lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of bright orange or red flowers with a distinctive, almost eye-like appearance. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, contributing to its unique visual appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its long blooming period, which can last several weeks during the summer months."
