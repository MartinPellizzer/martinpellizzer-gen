    "intro": "Colobocarpos nanus, commonly known as the dwarf starflower, is a small, flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its small size and ornamental flowers, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
