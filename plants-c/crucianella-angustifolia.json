    "intro": "Crucianella angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea bean, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and wind. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellow flowers followed by distinctive, bean-like pods. Its root system helps stabilize dunes, making it an important species for coastal dune restoration. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable plant in many areas."
