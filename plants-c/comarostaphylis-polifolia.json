    "intro": "Comarostaphylis polifolia, commonly known as the coastal dune aster, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and supporting local pollinators."
