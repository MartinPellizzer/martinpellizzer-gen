    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. capillare, commonly known as creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along streambanks. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common weed in agricultural areas."
