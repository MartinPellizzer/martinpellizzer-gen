    "intro": "Crucianella platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaved sea bean, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. It is a small, herbaceous shrub that typically grows in saline or brackish environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, leathery fruits. Its leaves are elliptical and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its salty habitat. Crucianella platyphylla is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
