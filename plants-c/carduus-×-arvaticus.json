    "intro": "Carduus \u00d7 arvaticus, commonly known as the rough hawksbeard, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and yellow composite flowers that resemble a cluster of small sunflowers. The leaves are typically rough and serrated, with a grayish or whitish underside that gives them a distinctive appearance. This plant is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
