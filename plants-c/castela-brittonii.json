    "intro": "Castela brittonii, commonly known as the Britton's castela, is a rare shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its compact, woody structure. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Castela brittonii is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, making it a unique example of desert flora."
