    "intro": "Cleisostoma pilosulum, commonly known as the hairy cleisostoma, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and attractive, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a velvety texture, and its roots are often covered in a dense, hairy coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cleisostoma pilosulum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
