    "intro": "Crotalaria dissitiflora var. eremaea, commonly known as the desert crown flower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a herbaceous annual with hairy, branching stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The species is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry grasslands."
