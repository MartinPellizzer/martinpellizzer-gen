    "intro": "Convolvulus arvensis f. pallidiroseus, commonly known as the pale rose-flowered field bindweed, is a variant of the annual field bindweed characterized by its pale pink to rose-colored flowers. It is a herbaceous plant with slender, twining stems that often grow along the ground or climb over other vegetation. The leaves are heart-shaped, with a hairy surface, and the flowers are typically borne in clusters at the leaf axils. This subspecies is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, often becoming an invasive weed in agricultural settings. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other convolvulus species, particularly in its flower color and growth habit."
