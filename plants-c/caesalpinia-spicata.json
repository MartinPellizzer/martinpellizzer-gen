    "intro": "Caesalpinia spicata, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its bright red, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in summer, making it a striking ornamental plant. The leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets that give the plant a feathery appearance. Its flowers are typically clustered in spicate racemes, and the plant produces elongated, woody pods that contain several seeds. Caesalpinia spicata thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for warm climates."
