    "intro": "Caloscilla venusta, commonly known as the velvetleaf or purpleleaf beauty, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its velvety, deep green leaves that often display a purplish tinge, especially in cooler weather. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
