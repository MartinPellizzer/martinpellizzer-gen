    "intro": "Cynomarathrum macbridei, commonly known as the MacBride's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Cynomarathrum macbridei is considered a critically endangered species."
