    "intro": "Cacabus, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers followed by orange-yellow fruits that contain toxic seeds. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system for water retention. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or edible purposes."
