    "intro": "Chaenostoma dielsianum, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
