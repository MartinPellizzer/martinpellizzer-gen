    "intro": "Cuscuta indecora var. integriuscula, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its host to establish a connection. The plant is native to North America and can be found in various habitats, including agricultural fields and disturbed areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread widely. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and native vegetation."
