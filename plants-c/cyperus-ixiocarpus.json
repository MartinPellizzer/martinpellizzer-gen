    "intro": "Cyperus ixiocarpus, commonly known as the spiny flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Its slender, grass-like leaves are often covered in small, spiny structures, which help in seed dispersal. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into three-lobed, spiky fruits."
