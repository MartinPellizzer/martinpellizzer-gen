    "intro": "Cousinia firuzkuhensis, commonly known as the Firuzkuh cushion plant, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Iran. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces small, pinkish to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It has hairy, narrow leaves that reduce water loss and are adapted to the extreme climate of its native habitat. Cousinia firuzkuhensis is an important component of the alpine flora in the Caucasus and Zagros mountain ranges."
