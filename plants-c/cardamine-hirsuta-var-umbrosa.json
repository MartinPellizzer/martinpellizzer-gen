    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. umbrosa, commonly known as the hairy watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to shaded, moist environments in temperate regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in rich, humusy soil and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Due to its delicate appearance and preference for shade, it is a sought-after plant in shady garden settings."
