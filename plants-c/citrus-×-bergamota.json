    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 bergamota, commonly known as the bergamot, is a hybrid citrus plant originating from the natural cross between the citron and the sour orange. It is characterized by its thick, peels that contain a high concentration of essential oils, particularly limonene, which contribute to its aromatic properties. The plant typically grows as a small evergreen tree or shrub, with dark green, glossy leaves and fragrant white flowers. Its fruit, which is usually harvested before it fully ripens, is widely used in the production of essential oils, perfumes, and as a flavoring agent in food and beverages. The botanical features of bergamot make it a valuable species in both horticulture and the fragrance industry."
