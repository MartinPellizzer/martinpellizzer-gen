    "intro": "Clusia mirandensis, commonly known as the Mirandense glorybower, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and showy inflorescences. Clusia mirandensis is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in humid, tropical conditions."
