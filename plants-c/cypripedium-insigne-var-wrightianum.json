    "intro": "Cypripedium insigne var. wrightianum, commonly known as the Wright's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a pink or white lip with a distinctive red or purple pattern. The plant has a terrestrial growth habit, with a short, thick rhizome and broad, pleated leaves. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, often in shaded forest environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
