    "intro": "Cotoneaster omissus, commonly known as the slender cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries that persist into winter. Cotoneaster omissus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant fall foliage and persistent fruit, which attract wildlife."
