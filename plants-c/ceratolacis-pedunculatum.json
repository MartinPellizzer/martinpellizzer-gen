    "intro": "Ceratolacis pedunculatum, commonly known as the clustered horned lichen, is a unique foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a distinctive growth pattern with clustered, horn-like structures that give it its common name. The thallus is typically greenish-gray, with a dense, velvety surface that helps it retain moisture. It often grows on tree trunks and soil in temperate forests, forming symbiotic relationships with algae and fungi. This lichen is an indicator species for environmental conditions, reflecting air quality and humidity levels in its habitat."
