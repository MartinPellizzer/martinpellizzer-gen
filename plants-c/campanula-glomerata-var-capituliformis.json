    "intro": "Campanula glomerata var. capituliformis, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features upright stems that bear dense clusters of violet-blue, bell-shaped flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its compact growth habit and showy flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements."
