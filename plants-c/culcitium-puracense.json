    "intro": "Culcitium puracense, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-draining soil, often found in cloud forests. Its unique morphology includes narrow leaves and a sympodial growth habit, which is typical of many orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Culcitium puracense is considered a species of conservation concern."
