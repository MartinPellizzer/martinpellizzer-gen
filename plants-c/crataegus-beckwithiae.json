    "intro": "Crataegus beckwithiae, commonly known as Beckwith's hawthorn, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in Yunnan Province. This shrub or small tree typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
