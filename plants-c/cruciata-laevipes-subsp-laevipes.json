    "intro": "Cruciata laevipes subsp. laevipes, commonly known as the desert crucifix, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The species is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant in its native habitat."
