    "intro": "Chlamysporum juncifolium, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter wide, arranged in dense clusters at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands in moist soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
