It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with small, narrow leaves adapted to conserve water. Chadsia is well-suited to harsh environments, thriving in full sun and low moisture conditions. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it an important component of local ecosystems."
