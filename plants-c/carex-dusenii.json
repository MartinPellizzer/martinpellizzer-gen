It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wet meadows. It produces small, clustered inflorescences of greenish-yellow flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Carex dusenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
