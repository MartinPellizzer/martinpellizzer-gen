    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum refractum, commonly known as the refractive bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, often pale blue or white flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often hairy as well. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cirrhopetalum refractum is considered a rare and delicate species."
