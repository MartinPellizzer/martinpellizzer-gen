    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 grantii, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex morrowii and Carex riparia, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream sides, and forms dense clumps with grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often reddish or purplish in color, adding ornamental value. Carex \u00d7 grantii is valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and its aesthetic appeal in wetland gardens."
