    "intro": "Carnegiea tetetzo, commonly known as the Sotol plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Agavaceae. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The Sotol plant is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and is an important component of its ecosystem."
