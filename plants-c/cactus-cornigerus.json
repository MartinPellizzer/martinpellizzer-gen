    "intro": "Cactus cornigerus, commonly known as the golden cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that are covered in spines and can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a vibrant touch to its desert environment. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Cactus cornigerus is often used in landscaping due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
