    "intro": "Calycosia macrocyatha, commonly known as the broad-leaved goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features showy yellow ray flowers surrounded by tubular disc flowers, typical of the family. Its leaves are broad and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Calycosia macrocyatha is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in areas with low precipitation."
