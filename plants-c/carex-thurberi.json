    "intro": "Carex thurberi, commonly known as Thurber\u2019s sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and other grass-like plants. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. Carex thurberi is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
