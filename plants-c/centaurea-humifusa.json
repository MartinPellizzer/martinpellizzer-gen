    "intro": "Centaurea humifusa, commonly known as the creeping cornflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bright yellow to orange flowers with purple or brown centers, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. Centaurea humifusa is often found in dry grasslands, rocky areas, and along roadsides."
