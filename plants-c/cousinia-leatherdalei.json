    "intro": "Cousinia leatherdalei, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapting well to harsh, dry environments. The plant features slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, often displaying shades of pink or purple. Cousinia leatherdalei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens due to its drought tolerance."
