    "intro": "Cerastium arvense subsp. arvum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate or ascending stems covered with fine, hairy glands, and its leaves are small, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in garden beds. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it both a common weed and a valuable ground cover in certain ecological contexts."
