    "intro": "Cuscuta approximata var. schiraziana, commonly known as the Persian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless stems. This species is native to parts of Asia, including Iran, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It commonly parasitizes a variety of plants, including shrubs and trees, and can significantly impact the growth of its host. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can be a nuisance in agricultural settings."
