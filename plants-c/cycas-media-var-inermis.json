    "intro": "Cycas media var. inermis, commonly known as the slender cycad, is a species of cycad native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, feather-like leaves that grow in a dense, upright cluster. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
