    "intro": "Cystopteris reevesiana, commonly known as the Reeves' water fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and often covered in a layer of brownish, fibrous material. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
