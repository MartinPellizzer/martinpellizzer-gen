    "intro": "Carex pallescens var. orophila, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that are clustered at the ends of its stems. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude conditions. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons."
