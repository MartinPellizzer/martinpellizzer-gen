    "intro": "Copernicia yarey var. yarey, commonly known as the Yarey palm, is a species native to the Caribbean, particularly found in parts of Cuba and the Bahamas. It is a small, ornamental palm characterized by its clustered, feather-like leaves and smooth, grayish trunk. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by the development of coconut-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for tropical and subtropical gardens. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
