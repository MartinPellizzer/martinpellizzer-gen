It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence that bears small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. Cladium huttonii thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and swamps. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
