    "intro": "Carex phaeocephala, commonly known as the black-headed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dark brown to black inflorescence, which contrasts with its grass-like foliage. Native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, three-ranked spikelets. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and ornamental horticulture."
