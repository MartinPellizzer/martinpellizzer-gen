    "intro": "Cordyline rigidifolia, commonly known as the stiff-leaved cabbage tree, is a striking tropical plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, stiff, lance-shaped leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that emerge from the base of the leaves, followed by bright red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.
