    "intro": "Cluytiandra perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's cluytiandra, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within tropical forests, often as an understory species. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cluytiandra perrieri is considered a species of conservation concern."
