    "intro": "Clematis dioica subvar. umbellulifera, commonly known as the umbrella-leaved clematis, is a climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental foliage and modest flowering display."
