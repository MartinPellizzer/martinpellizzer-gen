    "intro": "Calliandra macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed calliandra, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that consist of clusters of pink to red flowers, which bloom in summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its vibrant floral display. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. Additionally, its flowers are a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
