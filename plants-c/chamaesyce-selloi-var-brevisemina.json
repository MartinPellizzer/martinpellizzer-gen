    "intro": "Chamaesyce selloi var. brevisemina, commonly known as the short-seeded sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscaped gardens."
