    "intro": "Carex debilis var. interjecta, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive sheen. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in early summer, adding subtle floral interest. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in areas with partial to full sun. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration and garden landscapes."
