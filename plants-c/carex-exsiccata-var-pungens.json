It is characterized by its stiff, grass-like foliage with sharp, pointed leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
