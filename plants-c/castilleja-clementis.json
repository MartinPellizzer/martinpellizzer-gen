    "intro": "Castilleja clementis, commonly known as the Clement's milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and leaves that are usually opposite or whorled. It grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Due to its parasitic nature, it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants."
