    "intro": "Cheiranthus fragrans, commonly known as the sweetstock, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Cheiranthus fragrans is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and pleasant scent."
