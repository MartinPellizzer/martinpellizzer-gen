    "intro": "Crataegus fecunda, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are typically eaten by birds and mammals. Crataegus fecunda is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, and it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and traditional herbal medicine."
