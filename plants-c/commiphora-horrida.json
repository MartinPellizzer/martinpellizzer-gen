    "intro": "Commiphora horrida, commonly known as the African frankincense tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces a resinous sap that is tapped for its aromatic gum, which has been used traditionally in various cultural and medicinal practices. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. The plant's botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic environments."
