    "intro": "Cryptocarya neilgherrensis, commonly known as the Nilgiri cryptocarya, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within montane forests, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and have a distinct aromatic scent, while its fruit is a small, woody drupe. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for both ecological and potential medicinal research."
