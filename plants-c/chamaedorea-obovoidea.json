It features gracefully arching leaves that are oval in shape, giving it a lush, tropical appearance. The plant has a slender, upright trunk that is often covered in a smooth, grayish-brown bark. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to maintain its health. Due to its air-purifying qualities and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
