It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils. Coleonema filiforme prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
