    "intro": "Cyperus phymatodes, commonly known as the swamp spikerush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and spike-like flower clusters that emerge from the base of the plant. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense stands that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
