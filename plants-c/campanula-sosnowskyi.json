    "intro": "Campanula sosnowskyi, commonly known as Sosnowsky's bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
