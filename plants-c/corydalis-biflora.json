    "intro": "Corydalis biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters of two, giving it its common name. The plant has slender, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in meadows and forest edges. Corydalis biflora is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
