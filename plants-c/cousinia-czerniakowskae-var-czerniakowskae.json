    "intro": "Cousinia czerniakowskae var. czerniakowskae, commonly known as the Czerwinski's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. The leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat."
