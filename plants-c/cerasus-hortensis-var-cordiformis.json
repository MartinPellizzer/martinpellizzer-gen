    "intro": "Cerasus hortensis var. cordiformis, commonly known as the heart-shaped cherry, is a cultivar of the sweet cherry species. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped fruits, which are typically smaller and more intensely flavored than standard cherries. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with dark green, oval-shaped leaves. It blooms with fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by the development of its unique, heart-shaped berries. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and culinary use in jams and desserts."
