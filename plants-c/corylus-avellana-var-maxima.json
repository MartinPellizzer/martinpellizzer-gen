    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. maxima, commonly known as the giant hazelnut, is a variant of the common hazelnut characterized by its larger nuts and robust growth habit. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk, which mature in the autumn. Its leaves are typically oval with a serrated margin and turn yellow in the fall. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and for its potential in nut production."
