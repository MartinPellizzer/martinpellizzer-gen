    "intro": "Carinta uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower carinta, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, solitary flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale purple, often in late spring or early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal moths, which are attracted to its strong, sweet fragrance. Due to habitat loss, Carinta uniflora is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
