    "intro": "Chionochloa rubra subsp. occulta, commonly known as the hidden red grass, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring moist, rocky soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing mountainous terrain. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
