    "intro": "Calytrix mimiana, commonly known as the coastal holly or mimiana holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. It is well adapted to sandy soils and salty coastal environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant. Calytrix mimiana is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
