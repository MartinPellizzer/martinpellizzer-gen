    "intro": "Cassytha americana var. brachystachya, commonly known as the short-stemmed dodder, is a parasitic vine native to the southeastern United States. It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and is often found in wetland habitats. Its stems are slender and twining, allowing it to spread along the surface of water or among vegetation. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
