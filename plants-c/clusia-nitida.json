It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are surrounded by brightly colored bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Clusia nitida is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to grow in a variety of conditions."
