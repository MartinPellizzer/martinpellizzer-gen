    "intro": "Crataegus crus-galli var. linearis, commonly known as the slender dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and moist soils, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and conservation areas."
