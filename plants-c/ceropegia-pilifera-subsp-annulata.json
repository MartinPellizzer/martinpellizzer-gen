    "intro": "Ceropegia pilifera subsp. annulata, commonly known as the ringed milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among species in the Asclepiadaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing along rocky outcrops or in sandy soils. The subspecies annulata is distinguished by its unique floral structure and the presence of a ring-like pattern on its leaves."
