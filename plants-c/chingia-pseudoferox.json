    "intro": "Chingia pseudoferox, commonly known as the ferocious chingia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features vibrant, bioluminescent leaves that emit a faint blue glow during the night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant produces small, spiky flowers in shades of purple and crimson, which bloom only under specific lunar conditions. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to absorb nutrients from rocky soil in extreme environments. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is classified as an endangered species."
