    "intro": "Crataegus pruinosa var. gattingeri, commonly known as the Gattinger's hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its smooth, often grayish bark and small, sharp, elliptical leaves that are usually covered with a whitish bloom. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native range."
