It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and night-blooming characteristics."
