    "intro": "Ceratophyllum inflatum, commonly known as the inflated hornwort, is a unique aquatic plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and its distinctive, inflated, green to reddish stems that resemble small, floating branches. The plant lacks true leaves but has whorled clusters of tiny, scale-like structures at the nodes. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and lakes. Ceratophyllum inflatum is a popular choice for aquariums due to its ornamental appearance and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
