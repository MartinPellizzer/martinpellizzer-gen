    "intro": "Corydalis repens var. watanabei, commonly known as the creeping corydalis, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across forest floors or rocky areas. The plant produces delicate, spurred flowers in shades of pink or purple, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
