It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in the summer months. It is often considered a weed but has some historical use in traditional medicine."
