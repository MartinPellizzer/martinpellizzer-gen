    "intro": "Cassia setosa, commonly known as the Chinese cassia or small-leaf cassia, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and pinnately compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces yellow, fragrant flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Cassia setosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in warm climates."
