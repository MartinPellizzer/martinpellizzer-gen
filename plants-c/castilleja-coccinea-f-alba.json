It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its showy appearance makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
