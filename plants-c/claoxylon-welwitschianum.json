    "intro": "Claoxylon welwitschianum, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a large evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and long, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
