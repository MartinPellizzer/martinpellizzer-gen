    "intro": "Crudia liberica, commonly known as the Liberian coffee tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to western Africa, particularly found in countries like Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and produces small, white flowers that develop into red berries. The seeds within the berries are the source of the coffee beans used in specialty coffee blends. Due to its limited geographic range and susceptibility to diseases, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
