    "intro": "Conopholis ludoviciana, commonly known as the scarlet gourd, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains several seeds. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain wildlife species."
