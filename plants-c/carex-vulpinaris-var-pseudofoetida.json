    "intro": "Carex vulpinaris var. pseudofoetida, commonly known as the stink couch sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that often have a slight reddish tinge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its unique scent, which can be unpleasant, gives it its common name and makes it distinctive among sedges."
