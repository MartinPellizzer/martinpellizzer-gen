    "intro": "Cleomella sparsifolia, commonly known as the sparsely-leaved cleom, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Cleomaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are often clustered in racemes and produce small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Cleomella sparsifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
