    "intro": "Cyclacanthus poilanei, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this rare species."
