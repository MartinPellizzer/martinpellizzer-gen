    "intro": "Carex atrofusca var. decolorata, commonly known as the dark sedge, is a variant of the dark sedge species native to moist, temperate regions. It is characterized by its dark green, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in poorly drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture. The decolorata variant is distinguished by its reduced or absent flowering structures compared to the typical form."
