    "intro": "Celtis napalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas and parts of South Asia. It belongs to the Ulmaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by small, round berries that are edible for some animals but not typically for humans. Celtis napalensis is often found in moist, temperate forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
