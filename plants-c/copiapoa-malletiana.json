    "intro": "Copiapoa malletiana, commonly known as the Mallet's candle cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant has a smooth, waxy surface and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the spring. It is adapted to arid environments with minimal rainfall, storing water in its thick stem. Its botanical features make it well-suited for cultivation in dry climates with adequate sunlight."
