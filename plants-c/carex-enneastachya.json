    "intro": "Carex enneastachya, commonly known as the nine-branched sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, but the plant is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
