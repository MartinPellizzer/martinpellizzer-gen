    "intro": "Cuscuta lentis, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, thread-like stems that attach to host plants. The plant is widely distributed and can parasitize a variety of agricultural crops, making it a significant weed in many regions. Its seeds are highly persistent and can remain viable in the soil for many years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause substantial damage to both cultivated and wild plants."
