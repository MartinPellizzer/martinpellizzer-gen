    "intro": "Centropogon griseus, commonly known as the gray beard grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grayish-blue blades that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale purple or white flowers. It is typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, often in the Caribbean and parts of South America. Centropogon griseus is adapted to saline environments and is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
