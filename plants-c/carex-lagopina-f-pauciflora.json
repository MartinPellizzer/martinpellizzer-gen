    "intro": "Carex lagopina f. pauciflora, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a variant of the slender sedge species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and a dense, cylindrical inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. This form is distinguished by its reduced flowering structure, which is a key feature of the 'pauciflora' variety."
