    "intro": "Cardamine modocensis, commonly known as Modoc watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a serrated edge and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, wet soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
