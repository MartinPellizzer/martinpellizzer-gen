    "intro": "Chlorogalum parviflorum, commonly known as the littleflower milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are clustered in a terminal inflorescence and are visited by various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. The plant is also known for its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation."
