    "intro": "Carex mutans, commonly known as the variable sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and pond edges. Carex mutans is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
