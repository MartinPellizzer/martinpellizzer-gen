    "intro": "Cactus tetracanthus, commonly known as the fishhook cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sunlight. Its unique structure and adaptations make it well-suited for desert climates and a popular choice for rock gardens."
