It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are sturdy and often branched. Campanula ruscinonensis prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens and alpine gardens."
