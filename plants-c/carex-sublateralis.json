    "intro": "Carex sublateralis, commonly known as the lateral-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Carex sublateralis prefers full to partial sun and is often found in marshy areas, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
