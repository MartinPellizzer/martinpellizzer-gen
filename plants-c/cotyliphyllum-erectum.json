    "intro": "Cotyliphyllum erectum, commonly known as the upright cotyliphyllum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants like philodendrons and peace lilies, characterized by their unique inflorescence structures. The plant features a slender, upright stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. Its flowers are small and clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
