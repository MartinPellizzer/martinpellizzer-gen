    "intro": "Carpobrotus edulis subsp. parviflorus, commonly known as coast fig, is a low-growing succulent native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers, typically in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its rhizomatous growth habit enables it to spread rapidly, often forming dense mats that can outcompete native vegetation. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many parts of the world, including California and the Mediterranean."
