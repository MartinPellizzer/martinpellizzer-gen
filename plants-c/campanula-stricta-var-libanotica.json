It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
