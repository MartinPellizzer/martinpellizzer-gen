    "intro": "Cerastium pumilum subsp. subechinulatum, commonly known as the small sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, soft pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. This subspecies is often found in high-altitude meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh conditions."
