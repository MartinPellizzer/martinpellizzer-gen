    "intro": "Ceanothus mystacinus, commonly known as the silverleaf ceanothus, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, clustered blue or purple flowers in the spring, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or coastal areas. Ceanothus mystacinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
