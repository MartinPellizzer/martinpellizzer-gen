    "intro": "Cenchrus intectus, commonly known as the African grass or red grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple hues. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for marginal lands. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, and it is sometimes used in traditional land management practices. Cenchrus intectus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential for forage in certain regions."
