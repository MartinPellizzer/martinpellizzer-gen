It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
