    "intro": "Carex pediformis subsp. rhizodes, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a tight, cylindrical cluster. Its flowering spikes are usually short and inconspicuous, bearing small, three-lobed flowers. The rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in its native environment."
