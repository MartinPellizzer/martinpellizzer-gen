    "intro": "Cucumis foetidus, commonly known as the stink cucumber, is a flowering plant in the Cucurbitaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its hairy, yellowish-green fruit that resembles a small cucumber. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a distinct, often unpleasant odor, which is likely an evolutionary adaptation to attract specific pollinators. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall appearance. The fruit is typically harvested when immature, though it can be eaten when fully grown, albeit with a strong, pungent flavor."
