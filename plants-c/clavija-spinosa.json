    "intro": "Clavija spinosa, commonly known as the spiny clavija, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in dry grasslands and rocky soils. Clavija spinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
