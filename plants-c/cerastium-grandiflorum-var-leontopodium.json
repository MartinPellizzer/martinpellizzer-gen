    "intro": "Cerastium grandiflorum var. leontopodium, commonly known as the snow pearl or alpine snowbell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, silver-white leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are often adorned with a distinctive tuft of white filaments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in rock gardens and alpine displays."
