    "intro": "Caladenia longicauda subsp. crassa, commonly known as the broad-tailed spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid endemic to Western Australia. It features a slender, erect stem with a single, hairy leaf and a basal rosette of linear leaves. The plant produces a single spike bearing several pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive, elongated spur. It thrives in sandy soils within heathland and woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
