    "intro": "Corrigiola psammatrophoides, commonly known as the sand-milkweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It is often found growing in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to withstand drought and salt exposure."
