It is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many edible and ornamental species. The plant typically features small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations that may help reduce water loss in arid environments. This form is often found in rocky or disturbed soils, thriving in full sun."
