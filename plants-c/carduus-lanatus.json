    "intro": "Carduus lanatus, commonly known as the hairy thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its robust root system allows it to thrive in dry, disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. Carduus lanatus is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
