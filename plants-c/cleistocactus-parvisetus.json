    "intro": "Cleistocactus parvisetus, commonly known as the small-armed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and short, spiny stems that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, a unique trait among cacti. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid gardens."
