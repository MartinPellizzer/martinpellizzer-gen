    "intro": "Coburgia reticulata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental purposes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its growth habit is typically clumping, with each rosette producing new fronds over time. Coburgia reticulata is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded garden areas."
