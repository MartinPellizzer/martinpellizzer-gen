    "intro": "Comparettia langlassei, commonly known as the Langlasse's orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is a sympodial orchid with a rhizomatous growth habit, featuring a short, thick stem and a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a yellow lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
