    "intro": "Cannomois anfracta, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often purple or violet-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cannomois anfracta is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
