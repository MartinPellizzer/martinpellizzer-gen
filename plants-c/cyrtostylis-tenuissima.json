    "intro": "Cyrtostylis tenuissima, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features delicate, narrow leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
