    "intro": "Cypripedium insigne var. eyermannianum, commonly known as the Eyermann's Lady's Slipper, is a striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pinkish-purple hue and a prominent pouch-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its cool, humid habitat. This variant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
