    "intro": "Cathartolinum sanctum, commonly known as the sacred purging plant, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant contains bioactive compounds that have been traditionally used in indigenous medicine for their laxative and detoxifying properties. Its growth is slow and requires specific soil conditions, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Cathartolinum sanctum is now considered endangered."
