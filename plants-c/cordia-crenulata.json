    "intro": "Cordia crenulata, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and opposite, ovate leaves with wavy margins. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often forming dense thickets in mangrove ecosystems. Cordia crenulata plays a vital role in coastal stabilization and provides habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
