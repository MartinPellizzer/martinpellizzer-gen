    "intro": "Cryosophila, commonly known as the snow lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in extremely cold environments, often blooming during the brief summer months when the snow begins to melt. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand harsh winds and low temperatures. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, with a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators like bees and flies. Due to its specialized habitat, Cryosophila is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from climate change and habitat loss."
