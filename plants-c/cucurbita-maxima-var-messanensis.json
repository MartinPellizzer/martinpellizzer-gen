    "intro": "Cucurbita maxima var. messanensis, commonly known as the Sicilian pumpkin, is a variant of the widely cultivated Cucurbita maxima species. It is characterized by its large, elongated fruits with a thick, rugged rind and a vibrant orange to yellow flesh. This variety is native to southern Italy, particularly Sicily, and has been traditionally grown for its culinary and ornamental uses. The plant is a vigorous vine that produces both male and female flowers, typical of the Cucurbitaceae family. Its botanical features make it well-suited for both open-field and protected cultivation."
