    "intro": "Calligonum mongolicum, commonly known as Mongolian calligonum, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are extensive and deep, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Calligonum mongolicum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to prevent soil erosion."
