    "intro": "Cliffortia nitidula subsp. pilosa, commonly known as the silky cliffortia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its fuzzy leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on slopes and cliffs. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
