    "intro": "Carex pensylvanica var. lucorum, commonly known as the Pennsylvania sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It has narrow, dark green leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in the summer. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and ability to stabilize soil."
