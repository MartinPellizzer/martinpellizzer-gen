    "intro": "Cremanthodium plantaginifolium subsp. oligocephalum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cremanthodium, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy, narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
