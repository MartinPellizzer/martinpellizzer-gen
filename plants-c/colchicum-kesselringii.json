    "intro": "Colchicum kesselringii, commonly known as the Kesselring's colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Colchicaceae and is characterized by its striking, violet-blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a bulbous corm, which serves as its primary storage organ and allows it to survive in harsh, alpine conditions. Its leaves are basal, lanceolate, and often withering before flowering. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
