    "intro": "Ctenanthe, commonly known as the velvetleaf arrowroot, is a tropical plant belonging to the Araceae family. It is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in warm, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are often a deep green with a waxy texture. Ctenanthe is typically grown as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive indoors with proper care. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by berries, though the plant is primarily appreciated for its foliage."
