    "intro": "Cypella laeta, commonly known as the silverleaf cypella, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Cypella laeta is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
