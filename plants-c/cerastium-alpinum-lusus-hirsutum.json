    "intro": "Cerastium alpinum lusus hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy rock chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features prostrate stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous and subalpine habitats."
