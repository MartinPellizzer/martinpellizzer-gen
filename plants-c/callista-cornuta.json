    "intro": "Callista cornuta, commonly known as the horned cactus, is a unique species native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding visual interest to its desert habitat. Its name derives from the horn-like spines that adorn its stems, providing both protection and a distinctive appearance. Callista cornuta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking form and resilience."
