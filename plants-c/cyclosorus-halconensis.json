    "intro": "Cyclosorus halconensis, commonly known as the Halconensis liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, flat, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and covered in a layer of rhizoids. This liverwort thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can absorb moisture from the environment. Its reproductive structures, known as gametangia, are embedded within the thallus and are involved in sexual reproduction. Cyclosorus halconensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
