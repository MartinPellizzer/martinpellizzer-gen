    "intro": "Clinopodium marifolium, commonly known as mountain germander, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, producing tiny blue or purple blooms. Clinopodium marifolium is known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing benefits."
