    "intro": "Cistus seguieri, commonly known as the rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, evergreen leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and full sun exposure. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
