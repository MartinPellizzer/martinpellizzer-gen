    "intro": "Castilleja stipifolia, commonly known as the stiffleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange floral bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves, relying instead on modified stems and roots for photosynthesis. It forms symbiotic relationships with neighboring plants, drawing nutrients through specialized root structures. Castilleja stipifolia is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands."
