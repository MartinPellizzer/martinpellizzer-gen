    "intro": "Cynanchum acutum var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by follicles containing toxic seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by herbivores and is considered a challenging plant for cultivation."
