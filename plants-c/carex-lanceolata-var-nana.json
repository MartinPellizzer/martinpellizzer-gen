    "intro": "Carex lanceolata var. nana, commonly known as dwarf sword sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, acidic soils in woodland and wetland environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curled at the tips. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers in late spring to early summer. It is often used in ornamental landscaping for its compact form and ability to thrive in shaded areas. Carex lanceolata var. nana is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
