    "intro": "Calanthe graciliflora var. xuefengensis, commonly known as the Xuefeng orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to China, specifically the mountainous regions of Sichuan and Yunnan, where it thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces elegant, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive, intricate lip. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
