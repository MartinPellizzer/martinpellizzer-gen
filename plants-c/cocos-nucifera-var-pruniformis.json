    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. pruniformis, commonly known as the slender coconut palm, is a variant of the coconut tree characterized by its narrower, more elongated leaves compared to the standard coconut. This variety is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. It produces coconuts that are typically smaller and have a higher oil content than those of the common coconut. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in coastal areas for its aesthetic and practical uses. Its growth habit makes it suitable for landscaping and small-scale cultivation in tropical gardens."
