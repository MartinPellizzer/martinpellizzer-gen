    "intro": "Centaurea scabiosa var. fuliginosa, commonly known as the sooty centaury, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple to blackish flowers, which contrast with its gray-green foliage. The plant produces bracteate, spiny involucres that enclose its small, tubular florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for dry garden environments."
