    "intro": "Cyphomandra pilosa, commonly known as the hairy potato vine, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshade plants, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to egg-shaped, edible tuberous roots, similar to potatoes. Its leaves are typically oval with a rough texture and are covered in fine hairs. Cyphomandra pilosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible roots in some regions."
