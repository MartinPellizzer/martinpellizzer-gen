    "intro": "Crocus hadriaticus f. parnassicus, commonly known as the Parnassus crocus, is a rare and ornamental bulbous plant native to the Alps. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with a yellow center. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing delicate, cup-shaped flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
