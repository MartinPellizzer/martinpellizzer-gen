    "intro": "Ceraia torajaensis, commonly known as the Toraja ceraia, is a rare flowering plant native to the highlands of Southeast Sulawesi in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within montane forests, often at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, with a distinctive aromatic scent, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Ceraia torajaensis is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
