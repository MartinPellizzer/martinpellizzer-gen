    "intro": "Conopodium bunioides var. atlantis, commonly known as the Atlantic bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, inflated bladders that trap tiny aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, brackish water environments, where it forms dense mats on the substrate. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, adapted for efficient gas exchange in water. The species is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements."
