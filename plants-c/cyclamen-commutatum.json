    "intro": "Cyclamen commutatum, commonly known as the Persian cyclamen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features heart-shaped, velvety foliage that is often adorned with distinctive silver or white markings. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bowl-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Cyclamen commutatum prefers cool, moist environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses. Its tuberous roots allow it to survive in harsh conditions, making it resilient to periods of drought."
