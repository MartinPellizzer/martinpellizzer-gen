    "intro": "Cytisus arvensis, commonly known as yellow broom, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces bright yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, trifoliate, and covered in fine hairs. Cytisus arvensis is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize areas quickly, making it both a pioneer species and a potential weed."
