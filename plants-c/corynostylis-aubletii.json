    "intro": "Corynostylis aubletii, commonly known as the New Zealand lady's-tresses, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and a dense spike of small, pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
