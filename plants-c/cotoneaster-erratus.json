    "intro": "Cotoneaster erratus, commonly known as the hairy cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, thorny branches and small, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Its adaptability to various soil types and climate conditions makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
