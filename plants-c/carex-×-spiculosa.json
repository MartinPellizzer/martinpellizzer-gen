It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, capsule-like fruits. Carex \u00d7 spiculosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
