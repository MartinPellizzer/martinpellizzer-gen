It is native to the mountainous regions of Tibet and is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellowish flowers in spring, which are followed by pod fruits containing several seeds.

Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in stabilizing soils and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
