    "intro": "Copernicia rigida f. fissilingua, commonly known as the fissilingua copernicia, is a rare variant of the copernicia palm native to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. This plant is characterized by its slender, clustered growth habit and distinctive, elongated leaves that are often fissured or split along the midrib. The inflorescence consists of small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female structures. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is adapted to the specific microclimatic conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
