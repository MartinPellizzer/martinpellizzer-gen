    "intro": "Capparis sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian apple or kaweka, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and dry forests, characterized by its woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red-orange fruits resembling small apples. Its fruit is an important food source for native birds and other wildlife in Hawaii. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
