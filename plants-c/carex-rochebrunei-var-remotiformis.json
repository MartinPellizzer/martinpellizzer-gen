    "intro": "Carex rochebrunei var. remotiformis, commonly known as the remote-forming sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the sedge family."
