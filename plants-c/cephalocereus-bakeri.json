    "intro": "Cephalocereus bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert of the United States and Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often segmented and covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It is adapted to arid environments with deep root systems and a slow growth rate. Cephalocereus bakeri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
