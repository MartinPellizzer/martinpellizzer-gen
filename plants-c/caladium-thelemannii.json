    "intro": "Caladium thelemannii, commonly known as the flameleaf caladium, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, creating a vibrant display. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its decorative foliage rather than its small, inconspicuous flowers. Caladium thelemannii is typically grown as a houseplant or in shaded garden areas where it can flourish without direct sunlight."
