It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This variety is distinguished by its elongated, slender spikes of small, greenish-brown flowers that appear in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
