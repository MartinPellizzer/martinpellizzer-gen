    "intro": "Cynoglossum creticum var. atlanticum, commonly known as Atlantic heartwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the eastern United States. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the Atlantic coast, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a wavy margin, and it produces blue to violet flowers in late summer. Its botanical characteristics include a short, creeping rhizome and a flowering period that extends from July to September. This variety is notable for its adaptability to coastal conditions and its role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
