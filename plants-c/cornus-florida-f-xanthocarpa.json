    "intro": "Cornus florida f. xanthocarpa, commonly known as the yellow-flowered dogwood, is a unique cultivar of the flowering dogwood tree. It is characterized by its striking yellow bracts that replace the typical white or pink ones found in the species. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. This cultivar is valued for its seasonal color changes, adding visual interest throughout the growing season."
