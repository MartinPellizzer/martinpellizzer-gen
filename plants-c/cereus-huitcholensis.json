It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, a feature common in many desert cacti. It has spines that provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in arid regions for ornamental purposes."
