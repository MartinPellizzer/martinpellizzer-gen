    "intro": "Cypripedium fasciculatum f. purpureum, commonly known as the purple-flowered yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that feature a distinctive yellow pouch with a deep purple lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its botanical features include tall, erect stems and broad, leathery leaves. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
