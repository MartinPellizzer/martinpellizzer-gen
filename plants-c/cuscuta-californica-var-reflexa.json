    "intro": "Cuscuta californica var. reflexa, commonly known as the California dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that twine around its host. The plant is native to the western United States and is often found growing on shrubs and grasses. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant can form dense infestations on its host. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants, making it a potential agricultural weed."
