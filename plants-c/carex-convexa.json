    "intro": "Carex convexa, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Native to wet or moist environments, it thrives in marshy areas, stream banks, and other damp habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish dense colonies. Its adaptability makes it a common component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
