    "intro": "Clethra glandulosa, commonly known as sweet pepperbush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges and glandular dots on the underside. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Clethra glandulosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
