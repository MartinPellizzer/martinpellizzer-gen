    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum var. filiforme, commonly known as slender mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often described as resembling mouse ears, and it produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and it is often found in disturbed soils. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. The variety filiforme is distinguished by its slender, thread-like leaves, which set it apart from other varieties of Cerastium."
