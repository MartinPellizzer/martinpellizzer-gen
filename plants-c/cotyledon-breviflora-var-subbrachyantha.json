    "intro": "Cotyledon breviflora var. subbrachyantha, commonly known as the broad-leafed cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically broad and rounded, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and striking foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
