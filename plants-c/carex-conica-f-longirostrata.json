    "intro": "Carex conica f. longirostrata, commonly known as the long-beaked sedges, is a variant of the common sedge, characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and distinctive, spike-like inflorescence. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is typically found in moist, temperate environments such as wetlands and marshes. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in a single, terminal spike, which is typical of the genus Carex. The leaves are usually a glossy green, with a slightly pointed tip that gives the plant its common name."
