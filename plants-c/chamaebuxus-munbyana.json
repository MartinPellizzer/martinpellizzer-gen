    "intro": "Chamaebuxus munbyana, commonly known as Munby's buxus, is a species of evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Buxaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and leathery, dark green leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal sand dunes and rocky areas, where it forms dense thickets. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by red berries. Chamaebuxus munbyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
