It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Cyathodes squamuligera is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats."
