    "intro": "Cyperus karisimbiensis var. longinux, commonly known as the Karisimbi sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Virunga Mountains in East Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous grasslands and forest margins. It produces small, clustered flower heads that are wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
