    "intro": "Chondrocarpus sibthorpioides, commonly known as the sibthorpioid grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit with slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinct sheath at the base, and the plant thrives in moist, temperate environments. Chondrocarpus sibthorpioides is often found in wetlands and along streambanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
