    "intro": "Cochlearia pyrenaica subsp. aestuaria, commonly known as the coastal carnation, is a flowering plant native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and features small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant thrives in coastal environments, often growing on sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. This subspecies is adapted to tolerate salt spray and is often found in maritime climates."
