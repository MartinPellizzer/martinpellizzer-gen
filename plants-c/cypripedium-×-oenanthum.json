    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 oenanthum, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits a blend of characteristics from its parent species, Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive yellow pouch-like flower that resembles a slipper, which is used to attract pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem, usually between late spring and early summer. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also of interest in botanical research due to its hybrid nature and ecological adaptations."
