    "intro": "Cakile rugosa, commonly known as the hairy sea rocket, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is native to coastal areas of the northern hemisphere and thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by pods that contain several seeds. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in fine, hairy textures, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Cakile rugosa is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
