    "intro": "Capsicum hornemannii, commonly known as the hornemann's pepper, is a rare and unique species of chili pepper native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, elongated fruits that typically range in color from yellow to orange, with some varieties developing red hues as they mature. The plant is an annual herb with hairy stems and lobed leaves, often growing in dry, rocky habitats. It produces small white flowers that are followed by the distinctive, peppery fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Capsicum hornemannii is considered a botanically significant but under-studied species."
