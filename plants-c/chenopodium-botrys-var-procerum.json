    "intro": "Chenopodium botrys var. procerum, commonly known as the woolly goosefoot, is a herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, lobed leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in moist or wet environments. Its prostrate or ascending growth habit allows it to spread readily, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. The species is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
