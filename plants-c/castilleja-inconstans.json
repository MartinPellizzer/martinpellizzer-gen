    "intro": "Castilleja inconstans, commonly known as the sticky false flax, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients, often growing on grasses or shrubs. Its roots form haustoria, specialized structures that attach to the roots of host plants to extract water and minerals. Castilleja inconstans is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe."
