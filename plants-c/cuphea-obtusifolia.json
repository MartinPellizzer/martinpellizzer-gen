    "intro": "Cuphea obtusifolia, commonly known as the sticky cupplant, is a flowering plant native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture, which helps in deterring herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Cuphea obtusifolia is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects and its resilience in various climates."
