    "intro": "Celtis tournefortii, commonly known as the French hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by small, round berries that ripen to a dark blue or black color. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and can thrive in urban environments due to its tolerance for pollution and compacted soil. Celtis tournefortii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide shade in arid landscapes."
