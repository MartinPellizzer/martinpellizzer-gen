    "intro": "Celtis mississippiensis var. pumila, commonly known as the smoothleaf hackberry, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, oval leaves that are typically hairless on both sides. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, dark blue berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in moist to wet habitats, such as swamps and floodplains. The smoothleaf hackberry is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
