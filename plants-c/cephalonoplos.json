    "intro": "Cephalonoplos, commonly known as the crown-of-the-forest, is a rare and striking plant native to the dense, humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like leaves that can span up to two meters in diameter, providing significant shade under which other plants thrive. The plant produces vibrant, bioluminescent flowers that emit a soft glow at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in the nutrient-rich, moist soil of its natural habitat. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is considered a keystone species in its ecosystem."
