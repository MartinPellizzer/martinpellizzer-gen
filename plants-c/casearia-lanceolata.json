    "intro": "Casearia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf casearia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped, hence the specific epithet \"lanceolata,\" and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments. Casearia lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
