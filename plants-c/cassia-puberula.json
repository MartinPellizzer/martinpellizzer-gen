    "intro": "Cassia puberula, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by elongated pods containing flat, seed-filled pods. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Cassia puberula thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
