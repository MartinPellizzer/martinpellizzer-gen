    "intro": "Castilleja obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized root system. The plant produces showy, red or orange tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and oval, and it typically grows in open, sunny habitats like meadows and grasslands. Castilleja obovata plays an important role in its ecosystem by supporting pollinator populations and contributing to plant diversity."
