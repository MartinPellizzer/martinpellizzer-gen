    "intro": "Carex flaccifolia, commonly known as the flaccid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Carex flaccifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
