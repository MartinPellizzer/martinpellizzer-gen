    "intro": "Carpha alpina var. subacaulis, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand cold temperatures make it well adapted to harsh mountain climates. Botanically, it belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes various sedges and related plants."
