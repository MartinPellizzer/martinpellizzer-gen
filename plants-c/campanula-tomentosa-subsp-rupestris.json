    "intro": "Campanula tomentosa subsp. rupestris, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscaping."
