    "intro": "Castilleja durangensis, commonly known as the Durango milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the high elevations of Mexico. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in open grasslands and mountainous regions. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
