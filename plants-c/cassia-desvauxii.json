    "intro": "Cassia desvauxii, commonly known as the desert cassia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds when mature. Cassia desvauxii is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
