    "intro": "Cheilanthes neglecta, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and small, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices and dry, shaded environments, showcasing its adaptability to arid conditions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spores are released from terminal clusters on the fronds. Cheilanthes neglecta is often found in regions with Mediterranean climates, including parts of California and the southwestern United States."
