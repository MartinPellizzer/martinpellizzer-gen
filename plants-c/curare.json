    "intro": "Curare, commonly known as arrow poison, is a plant-derived substance primarily sourced from the seeds of the genus *Strychnos*, particularly *Strychnos toxifera* and *Strychnos nux-vomica*. It contains potent alkaloids such as strychnine and brucine, which act as neurotoxins by blocking neuromuscular transmission. The plant is native to tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. Traditionally, curare has been used by indigenous peoples for hunting and warfare. Its botanical significance lies in its complex chemical composition and historical use in human cultures."
