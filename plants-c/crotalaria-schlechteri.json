    "intro": "Crotalaria schlechteri, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with a rattle-like appendage on the petals. The plant is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with palmately divided leaves and clusters of small, showy blooms. It is often found in disturbed soils and is known for its role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The plant's unique floral structure and ecological significance make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
