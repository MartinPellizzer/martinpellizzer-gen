    "intro": "Crantzia lineata subvar. inundata, commonly known as the water crantzia, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, mat-forming foliage that thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are typically linear to lanceolate, often with a slightly hairy surface, and are adapted to retain moisture. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
