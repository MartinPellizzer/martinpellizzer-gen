    "intro": "Cyperus papuanus, commonly known as the Papuan flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Australia. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with slender, triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. Its flowering spikes are usually small and inconspicuous, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Cyperus papuanus is often used in ornamental gardening due to its ability to tolerate wet conditions and its aesthetic appeal in water gardens."
