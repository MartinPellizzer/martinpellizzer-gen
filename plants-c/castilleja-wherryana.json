    "intro": "Castilleja wherryana, commonly known as Wherry's paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, red to orange-red bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves, relying instead on its roots to absorb nutrients from host plants. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
