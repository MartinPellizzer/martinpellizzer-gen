    "intro": "Cycas changjiangensis, commonly known as the Changjiang cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
