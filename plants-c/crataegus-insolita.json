    "intro": "Crataegus insolita, commonly known as the rare thornapple, is a species of hawthorn native to parts of eastern and central Europe. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and it produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring. The fruit is a red, fleshy pome that ripens in late summer, often attracting birds and other wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Crataegus insolita is considered a rare and endangered species."
