    "intro": "Cuphea inflata, commonly known as the \"Whispering Angel\" or \"Cuphea with inflated flowers,\" is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Lythraceae family and is characterized by its unique, inflated, balloon-like bracts that encase the small, tubular flowers. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Cuphea inflata is relatively low maintenance and can be grown as an annual or perennial depending on the climate."
