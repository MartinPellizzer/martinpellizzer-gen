    "intro": "Centaurea triumfettii var. semidecurrens, commonly known as the creeping centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and vibrant blue to purple flowers. The plant produces small, cylindrical seed pods that release seeds through a mechanism called elaiophore, which helps in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas. This variety is closely related to other Centaurea species and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
