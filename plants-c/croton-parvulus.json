    "intro": "Croton parvulus, commonly known as the dwarf croton, is a small shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features small, palmate leaves with vibrant, colorful patterns that range from green to red and yellow. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens with suitable conditions."
