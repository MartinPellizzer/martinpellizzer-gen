    "intro": "Crassula compacta, commonly known as the Campfire Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge under direct sunlight. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the warmer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. Its compact growth habit makes it an ideal choice for rock gardens or as a container plant."
