It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white and pale pink. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, moist soil of its natural habitat. Cassuvium fulvinerve is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in traditional medicine."
