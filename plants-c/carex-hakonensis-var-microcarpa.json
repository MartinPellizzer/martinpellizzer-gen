    "intro": "Carex hakonensis var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf Hakon's sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other moist habitats. It has a clumping growth habit and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form of Carex hakonensis."
