    "intro": "Carex nigra var. alpicola, commonly known as alpine black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This variant is distinguished by its dark green to blackish foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically inconspicuous. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in high-altitude ecosystems."
