    "intro": "Cheiranthus scoparius var. chamaeleo, commonly known as the rock wallflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
