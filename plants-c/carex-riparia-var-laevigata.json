    "intro": "Carex riparia var. laevigata, commonly known as smooth river sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found along streams, ponds, and other freshwater bodies. Smooth river sedge plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
