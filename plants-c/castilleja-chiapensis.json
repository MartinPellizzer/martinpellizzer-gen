    "intro": "Castilleja chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it relies on host plants for water and some essential nutrients. Castilleja chiapensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
