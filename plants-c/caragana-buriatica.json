    "intro": "Caragana buriatica, commonly known as the Buriat barbed pea, is a shrub native to the cold regions of Siberia and Mongolia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, followed by pea-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arid climates. Caragana buriatica is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to prevent soil erosion."
