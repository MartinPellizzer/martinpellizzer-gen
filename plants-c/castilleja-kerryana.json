    "intro": "Castilleja kerryana, commonly known as Kerry's Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red-orange bract-like flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. Castilleja kerryana plays a role in pollination and serves as a food source for certain insects and wildlife."
