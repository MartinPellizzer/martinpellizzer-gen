    "intro": "Cotoneaster delphinensis, commonly known as the Delphin's cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and is characterized by its dense, rounded form and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Cotoneaster delphinensis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens and natural landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its seasonal display of flowers, foliage, and berries, making it a popular choice for horticultural use."
