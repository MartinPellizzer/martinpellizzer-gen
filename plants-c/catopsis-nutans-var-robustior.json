The plant produces small, colorful flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its striking appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
