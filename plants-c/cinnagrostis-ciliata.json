    "intro": "Cinnagrostis ciliata, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Cinnagrostis ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
