    "intro": "Carpobrotus rossii, commonly known as the coast fig, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops and sandy soils near the coast. Its ability to colonize disturbed areas makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems."
