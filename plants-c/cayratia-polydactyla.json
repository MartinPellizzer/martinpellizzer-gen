    "intro": "Cayratia polydactyla, commonly known as the climbing beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its vigorous climbing habit and clusters of small, fragrant, white to pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy texture. Cayratia polydactyla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
