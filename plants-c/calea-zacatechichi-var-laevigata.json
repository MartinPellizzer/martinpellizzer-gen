    "intro": "Calea zacatechichi var. laevigata, commonly known as the sacred candle plant, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, candle-like inflorescence that emerges from a rosette of dark green, velvety leaves. The plant produces small, tubular yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported calming and sedative properties. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
