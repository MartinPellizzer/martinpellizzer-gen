    "intro": "Cenchrus microcephalus, commonly known as little barley or dwarf barnyard grass, is a warm-season grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, bristly seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it can become a weed in cultivated areas."
