    "intro": "Crataegus fallax, commonly known as the nodding hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it is often found in moist, wooded areas. Crataegus fallax is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
