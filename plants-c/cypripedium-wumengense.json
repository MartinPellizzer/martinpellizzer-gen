    "intro": "Cypripedium wumengense, commonly known as the Wumeng lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers with a pouch-like lip and intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded forest environments at high altitudes. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it produces a single flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild."
