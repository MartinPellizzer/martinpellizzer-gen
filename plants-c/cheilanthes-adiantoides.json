    "intro": "Cheilanthes adiantoides, commonly known as the rock fern or shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. This plant is typically found growing on rock faces or in crevices, where it thrives in dry, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. The plant is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appearance and resilience."
