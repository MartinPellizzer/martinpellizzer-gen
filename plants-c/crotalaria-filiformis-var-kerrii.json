    "intro": "Crotalaria filiformis var. kerrii, commonly known as the slender cowpea or kerri's crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical pod-bearing structure and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant features small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets. It grows as an annual herb, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The seeds are enclosed in slender, hairy pods, which contribute to its common name."
