    "intro": "Crossoglossa lloensis, commonly known as the Lloens Island bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of Peru. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Its flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Crossoglossa lloensis is considered a vulnerable species."
