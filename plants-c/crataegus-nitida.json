    "intro": "Crataegus nitida, commonly known as the smooth hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and clusters of white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but generally not favored by humans. Crataegus nitida is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and open areas with well-drained soil. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ecological benefits to wildlife."
