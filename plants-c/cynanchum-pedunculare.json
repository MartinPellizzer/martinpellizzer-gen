It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its latex sap is milky and somewhat toxic. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Cynanchum pedunculare is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
