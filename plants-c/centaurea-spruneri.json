    "intro": "Centaurea spruneri, commonly known as the Alaskan blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features slender, branched stems and produces small, blue to purple flower heads that are often surrounded by pale blue bracts. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Centaurea spruneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
