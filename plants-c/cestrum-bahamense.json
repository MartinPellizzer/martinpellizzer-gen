It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, with opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically white or yellow, blooming in clusters during the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it prefers well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. Cestrum bahamense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for its pleasant fragrance."
