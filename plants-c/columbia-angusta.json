    "intro": "Columbia angusta, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its botanical features include a basal rosette of leaves and a single, erect stem that bears the flower heads. Columbia angusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
