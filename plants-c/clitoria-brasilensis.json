It features striking violet-blue flowers with wing-like petals that resemble the shape of a clitoris, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, edible pods containing seeds, which are sometimes used in traditional cuisine. Its leaves are trifoliate, and the plant thrives in warm, humid climates. Clitoria brasilensis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural systems."
