    "intro": "Carex dissita var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This variant is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly taller stature compared to the typical Carex dissita. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many sedges."
