    "intro": "Conostalix lacustris, commonly known as the lake swamp tree, is a rare species of flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and broad, glossy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically blooming during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in swampy environments. Due to habitat loss, Conostalix lacustris is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
