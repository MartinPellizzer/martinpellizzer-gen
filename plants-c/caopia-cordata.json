    "intro": "Caopia cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant's rhizomes are the primary part used, containing a starchy, edible substance similar to arrowroot. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and edible properties, it is cultivated both for horticultural purposes and as a food source."
