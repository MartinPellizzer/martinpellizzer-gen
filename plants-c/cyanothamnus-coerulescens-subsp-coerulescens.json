    "intro": "Cyanothamnus coerulescens subsp. coerulescens, commonly known as the blue everlasting or blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its blue to purple flowers that bloom in dense, showy clusters. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments. It has narrow, linear leaves and is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness. The subspecies is distinguished by its consistently blue flower color, setting it apart from other related species."
