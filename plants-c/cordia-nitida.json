    "intro": "Cordia nitida, commonly known as the white cedar or white flame tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellow or orange fruits containing three winged seeds. Cordia nitida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
