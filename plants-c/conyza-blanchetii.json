It is an annual herb that typically grows in open habitats such as fields and roadsides. The plant features small, daisy-like yellow flowers with a composite structure composed of ray and disk florets. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, and it produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Conyza blanchetii is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
