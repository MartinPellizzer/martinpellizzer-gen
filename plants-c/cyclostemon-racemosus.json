    "intro": "Cyclostemon racemosus, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with woody stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Cyclostemon racemosus is often found in sandy soils and is used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
