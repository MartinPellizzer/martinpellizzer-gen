    "intro": "Chondrilla ramosissima, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including livestock. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in dryland gardens."
