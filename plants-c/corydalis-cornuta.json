    "intro": "Corydalis cornuta, commonly known as the spurred wintercress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces distinctive, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Corydalis cornuta is often found in rocky or woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. It is a perennial herb that can grow up to 30 centimeters tall, with a fibrous root system that helps it survive in harsh environments."
