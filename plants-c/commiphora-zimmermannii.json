    "intro": "Commiphora zimmermannii, commonly known as the African myrrh, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic resinous exudates, which have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered. The resin, known as myrrh, is harvested from the bark and has a strong, balsamic scent."
