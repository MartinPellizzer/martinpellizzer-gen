    "intro": "Cyclopogon multiflorus, commonly known as the multibloom cyclopogon, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its robust, clustered growth habit. The plant produces multiple small, fragrant white flowers along its inflorescence, which are often arranged in a spiral pattern. Its leaves are long and pinnately compound, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Cyclopogon multiflorus is typically grown as a houseplant or in warm, humid climates due to its sensitivity to cold temperatures."
