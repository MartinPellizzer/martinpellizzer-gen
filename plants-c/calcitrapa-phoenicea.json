    "intro": "Calcitrapa phoenicea, commonly known as the purple sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Calcitrapa phoenicea is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
