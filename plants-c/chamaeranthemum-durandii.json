It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces bright red or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance.
