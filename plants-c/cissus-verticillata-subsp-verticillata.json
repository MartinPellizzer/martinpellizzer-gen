    "intro": "Cissus verticillata subsp. verticillata, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by edible, round, fleshy berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing along walls, trees, and rocky surfaces. Its ability to climb and its rapid growth make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
