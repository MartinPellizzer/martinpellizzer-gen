    "intro": "Carex rotundata var. sommeri, commonly known as the Summer Carex, is a perennial sedge native to Europe. It features dense, grass-like foliage with dark green, cylindrical leaves that are often slightly curled. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to greenish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along streambanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
