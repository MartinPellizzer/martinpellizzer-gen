    "intro": "Cynorkis sambiranoensis, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the island of Madagascar. This plant is characterized by its unique, often vibrant floral structures and specialized growth habits adapted to its native environment. It typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid, shaded forest conditions. The species is notable for its intricate floral morphology, which includes specialized structures for pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cynorkis sambiranoensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
