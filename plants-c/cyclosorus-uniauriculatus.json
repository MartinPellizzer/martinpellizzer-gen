    "intro": "Cyclosorus uniauriculatus, commonly known as the single-ear moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its small, compact growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a distinct costa that extends beyond the mid-leaf. It produces spore capsules that are urn-shaped and have a distinctive, single auriculate lobe. This moss is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
