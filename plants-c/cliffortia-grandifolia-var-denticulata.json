It is a member of the Leguminosae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.
