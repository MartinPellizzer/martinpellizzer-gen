    "intro": "Ceratochaete, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, often hairy stems and leaves that are typically opposite or alternate in arrangement. The flowers are usually clustered in umbels and feature showy, often pink or red petals. Ceratochaete species are native to various regions in Africa and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. These plants produce milky sap, which can be toxic and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
