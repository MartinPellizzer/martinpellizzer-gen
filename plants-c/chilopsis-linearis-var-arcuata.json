    "intro": "Chilopsis linearis var. arcuata, commonly known as the rainbow cactus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that are often ribbed and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-draining soil with full sun exposure. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
