    "intro": "Chloris rufescens, commonly known as red hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Chloris rufescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native garden landscapes."
