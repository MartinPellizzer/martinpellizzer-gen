    "intro": "Commicarpus squarrosus, commonly known as the hairy bladder nut, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in dense, glandular hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by inflated, bladder-like fruits that contain seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited water. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
