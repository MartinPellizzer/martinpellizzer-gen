    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis var. tenuifolia, commonly known as slender water-crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist meadows and wetlands in Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, delicate, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a single umbel. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in its habitat. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
