    "intro": "Carex stricta subsp. cespitosa, commonly known as tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It forms dense tussocks with grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in early summer, contributing to its ecological importance as a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of lakes and ponds. Its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat makes it a valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
