    "intro": "Ceuthostoma, commonly known as the Siamese fighting fish, is a genus of small, freshwater fish native to Southeast Asia. While not a plant, it is often mistaken for one due to its aquatic habitat and delicate appearance. Its botanical-like features include its elongated body and vibrant coloration, which can resemble certain aquatic plants. The fish thrives in environments with dense vegetation, often hiding among leaves and roots. Despite its name, it is not related to plants but is frequently kept in aquariums alongside aquatic flora."
