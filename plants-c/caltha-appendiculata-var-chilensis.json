It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant features upright, slender stems that bear clusters of bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
