It features upright, branching stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces striking violet-blue to purple flower heads, which are composed of numerous small, ray-like florets surrounded by a dense cluster of tubular flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated edges, and are typically covered in a fine layer of down. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant summer blooms."
