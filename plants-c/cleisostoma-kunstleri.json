    "intro": "Cleisostoma kunstleri, commonly known as the golden wax plant, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features striking, showy flowers with a yellowish-orange color and a distinctive, waxy texture. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environments. Cleisostoma kunstleri thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
