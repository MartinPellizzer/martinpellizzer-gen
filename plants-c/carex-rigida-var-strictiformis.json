    "intro": "Carex rigida var. strictiformis, commonly known as rigid sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has a dense root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This variety is noted for its narrow, stiff leaves that give it a distinctive, architectural appearance."
