It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various arid and semi-arid environments."
