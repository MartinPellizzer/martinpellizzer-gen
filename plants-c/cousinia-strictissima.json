    "intro": "Cousinia strictissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf frostweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in dry, rocky environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cousinia strictissima is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
