    "intro": "Chaetospora tenax, commonly known as the sticky haircap moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth form and the presence of stiff, bristle-like hairs on its stalks. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its leaves are narrow and gradually taper to a sharp point, with a distinct midrib. Chaetospora tenax plays an important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
