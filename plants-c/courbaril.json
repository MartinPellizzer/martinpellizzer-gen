The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into edible, round fruits with a sweet, tangy flavor. Its wood is highly valued for its strength and durability, making it useful in construction and furniture-making. Additionally, the leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
