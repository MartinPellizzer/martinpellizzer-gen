    "intro": "Cirsium zamoranense, commonly known as the Zamora thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into bristly, oval-shaped achenes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
