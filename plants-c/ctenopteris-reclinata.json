    "intro": "Ctenopteris reclinata, commonly known as the drooping water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often droop gracefully from the plant. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to moist soil or substrates. Ctenopteris reclinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
