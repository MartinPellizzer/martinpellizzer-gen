    "intro": "Cardamine zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger buttercup, is a small herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many other buttercup species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
