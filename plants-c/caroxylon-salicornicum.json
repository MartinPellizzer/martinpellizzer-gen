    "intro": "Caroxylon salicornicum, commonly known as sea celery, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it tolerates high levels of salt in the soil. Its structure allows it to retain water efficiently, making it resilient in arid and brackish conditions. Caroxylon salicornicum plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various coastal organisms."
