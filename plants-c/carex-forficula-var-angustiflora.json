    "intro": "Carex forficula var. angustiflora, commonly known as narrow-leaved bog sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and grass-green, with a dense, clump-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
