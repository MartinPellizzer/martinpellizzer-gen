    "intro": "Centaurea czirkejensis, commonly known as the Czirkej's cornflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its striking blue to purple flowers appear in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
