    "intro": "Calanthe puberula var. okushirensis, commonly known as the Okushiro calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive green throat. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, soft pubescence, giving it a velvety texture. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
