    "intro": "Cyclosorus verruculosus, commonly known as the rough staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and attaches itself to trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its fronds are covered in a thick layer of spongy, moss-like tissue that helps retain moisture. The plant's reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
