It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
