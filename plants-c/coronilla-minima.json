    "intro": "Coronilla minima, commonly known as the lesser crown vetch, is a low-growing, perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its adaptability makes it a hardy plant in various environmental conditions."
