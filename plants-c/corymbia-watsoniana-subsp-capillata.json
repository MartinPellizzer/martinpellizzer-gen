    "intro": "Corymbia watsoniana subsp. capillata, commonly known as the red gum or red blood gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in long, narrow strips. The plant produces distinctive white to pale pink flowers that appear in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, fibrous texture. This subspecies is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
