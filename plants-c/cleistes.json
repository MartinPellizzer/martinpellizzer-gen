    "intro": "Cleistes, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of only one species, Cleistes gardneri, which is native to the southeastern United States. The plant is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, almost lantern-like appearance. Cleistes has hairy stems and leaves, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits that are capsule-like. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in many parts of its range."
