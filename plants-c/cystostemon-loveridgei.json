    "intro": "Cystostemon loveridgei, commonly known as the slender-stemmed cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and a crown of pinnate, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
