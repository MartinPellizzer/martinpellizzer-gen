    "intro": "Conosilene, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and stems that help it conserve water in harsh environments. Conosilene produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in dry, hot climates with minimal water availability."
