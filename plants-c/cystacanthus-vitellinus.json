    "intro": "Cystacanthus vitellinus, commonly known as the golden cup plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a deep taproot system, which helps it thrive in well-drained soils and full sun conditions. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cystacanthus vitellinus is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
