    "intro": "Chamaeraphis sulcata, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often exhibit a zigzag or undulating pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its unique morphology and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening or ecological restoration projects."
