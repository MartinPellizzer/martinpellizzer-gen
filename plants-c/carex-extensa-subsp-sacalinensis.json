    "intro": "Carex extensa subsp. sacalinensis, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which develop into three-angled, dry berries."
