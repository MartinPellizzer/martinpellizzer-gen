    "intro": "Corydalis sangardanica, commonly known as the Kashmir corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of India and Pakistan. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped tubers underground, which serve as storage organs and are part of its survival strategy in its alpine habitat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and woodland settings. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and horticultural purposes."
