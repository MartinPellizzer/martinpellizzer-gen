    "intro": "Centaurea alba subsp. heldreichii, commonly known as the white knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
