    "intro": "Cistus ovatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and showy, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. Its evergreen foliage and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Cistus ovatus also plays a role in supporting local pollinators and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
