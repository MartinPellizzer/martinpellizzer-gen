    "intro": "Cordia tarmensis, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, pale pink or red fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to dry, well-drained soils. Cordia tarmensis is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and resilience."
