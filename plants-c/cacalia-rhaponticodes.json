    "intro": "Cacalia rhaponticodes, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant features slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered with fine hairs. Cacalia rhaponticodes thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
