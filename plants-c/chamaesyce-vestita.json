    "intro": "Chamaesyce vestita, commonly known as the white sand mat, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and full sun, making it a common sight in coastal dunes and open grasslands. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and aesthetic value."
