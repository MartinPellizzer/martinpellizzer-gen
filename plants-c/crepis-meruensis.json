    "intro": "Crepis meruensis, commonly known as the East African mouse-ear chickweed, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of East Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. It has small, hairy leaves and produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Crepis meruensis is adapted to high-altitude conditions and plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators."
