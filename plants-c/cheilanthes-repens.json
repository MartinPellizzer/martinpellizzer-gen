    "intro": "Cheilanthes repens, commonly known as the running brake fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the Americas. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across the ground, forming dense mats. The fronds are typically narrow and pinnately compound, with a leathery texture that helps it survive in dry conditions. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. This plant is drought-tolerant and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature."
