It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features a delicate, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and a single, slender flower spike. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinct three-lobed lip. Cranichis neglecta is known for its subtle beauty and is often overlooked due to its modest size and inconspicuous appearance."
