    "intro": "Cousinia xiphiolepis, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a splash of color to the desert landscape. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Cousinia xiphiolepis is well adapted to sandy soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
