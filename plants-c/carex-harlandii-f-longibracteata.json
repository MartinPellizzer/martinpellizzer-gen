    "intro": "Carex harlandii f. longibracteata, commonly known as the long bract sedge, is a variant of the Harland's sedge, characterized by its elongated bracts. It is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system, which aids in its survival in wetland habitats. The inflorescence consists of two distinct spikelets, with the lower one being longer and more prominent."
