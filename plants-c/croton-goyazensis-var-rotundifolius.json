It is characterized by its large, round or oval-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
