    "intro": "Cynanchum huberi, commonly known as the Huberi milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruits are follicles containing toxic seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
