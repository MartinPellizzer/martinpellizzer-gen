It features a thick, fleshy bulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in high-altitude, arid environments. The plant produces tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pink flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can withstand frost, making it a resilient species in mountainous regions. Its bulbs are sometimes used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
