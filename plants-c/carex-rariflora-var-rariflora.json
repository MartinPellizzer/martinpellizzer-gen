    "intro": "Carex rariflora var. rariflora, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in wetland habitats. The flowers are usually greenish or brownish and are wind-pollinated, typical of many sedges."
