    "intro": "Cheilanthes aurantia, commonly known as the golden spurge fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces bright yellow to orange spore-bearing leaves, which are distinctive in appearance. It is adapted to drought conditions and can survive in harsh, sun-exposed areas. The fronds are usually short and sturdy, with a leathery texture that helps reduce water loss."
