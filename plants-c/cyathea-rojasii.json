    "intro": "Cyathea rojasii, commonly known as the Rojas' tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with the fronds emerging from the top of the trunk in a spiral arrangement. Cyathea rojasii is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
