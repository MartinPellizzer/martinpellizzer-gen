    "intro": "Chaetolimon limbatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed limnanthes, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It belongs to the family Limnanthaceae and is characterized by its delicate, small flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant has slender, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
