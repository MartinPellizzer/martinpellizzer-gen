    "intro": "Centunculus mexicanus, commonly known as the Mexican buttonweed, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, though it does not produce fruits like its relatives. The plant typically grows in moist, open areas and has small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it is often found in disturbed soils. Despite its modest appearance, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
