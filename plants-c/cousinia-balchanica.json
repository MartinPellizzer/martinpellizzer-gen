    "intro": "Cousinia balchanica, commonly known as the Balchan's cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cousinia balchanica is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
