    "intro": "Crepidium szlachetkianum, commonly known as the Polish orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a pseudobulb and a single leaf. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence with pale yellow to greenish flowers that have a distinct, almost fleshy appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes."
