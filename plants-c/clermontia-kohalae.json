    "intro": "Clermontia kohalae, commonly known as the Kona mountain ginger, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Hawaii. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy white to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments at higher elevations, often in montane rainforests. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a distinctive, aromatic scent. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Clermontia kohalae is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
