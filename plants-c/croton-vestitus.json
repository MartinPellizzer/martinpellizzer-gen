It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage with deep green, almost metallic leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
