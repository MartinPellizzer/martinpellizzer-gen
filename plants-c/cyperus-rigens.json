    "intro": "Cyperus rigens, commonly known as the rigid flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets. The plant often grows in wet or moist soils, making it a common species in marshy areas and along waterways. Its leaves are linear and have a grass-like appearance, which helps in distinguishing it from other sedges. Cyperus rigens is often found in wetlands and can be an indicator of waterlogged soil conditions."
