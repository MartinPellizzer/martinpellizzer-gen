    "intro": "Cynometra simplicifolia, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sterculiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in open woodland and savanna habitats, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for timber and traditional uses."
