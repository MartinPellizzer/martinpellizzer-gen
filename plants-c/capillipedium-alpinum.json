    "intro": "Capillipedium alpinum, commonly known as the alpine capillary, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its aromatic leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant grows in rocky and alpine environments, adapting to cold and nutrient-poor soils. Its small, white flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species."
