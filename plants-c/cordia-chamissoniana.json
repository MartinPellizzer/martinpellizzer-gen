It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its showy yellow or orange flowers bloom in summer. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Cordia chamissoniana is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
