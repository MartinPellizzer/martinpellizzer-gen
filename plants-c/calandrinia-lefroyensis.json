    "intro": "Calandrinia lefroyensis, commonly known as the Lefroy's portulaca, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, pink, and yellow. The plant is adapted to hot, dry environments, with a short growth cycle that allows it to thrive in seasonal rainfall. Its flowers are typically borne on short stems and are often clustered together, forming a compact, ornamental display. Calandrinia lefroyensis is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is a common sight in the wilds of Namibia and South Africa."
