    "intro": "Canistrum auratum, commonly known as the golden trumpet cactus, is a species native to Central America and parts of South America. It is a succulent plant characterized by its cylindrical stems and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has spiny stems and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its leaves are typically small and reduced, as it relies on photosynthesis through its stems. Canistrum auratum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking appearance and resilience."
