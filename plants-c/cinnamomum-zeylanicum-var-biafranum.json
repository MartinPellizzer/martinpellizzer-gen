    "intro": "Cinnamomum zeylanicum var. biafranum, commonly known as African cinnamon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to West Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark brown bark that is used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elliptical, dark green leaves. Its essential oils, extracted from the leaves and bark, contain compounds like cinnamaldehyde and eugenol. This variant is less commonly cultivated than its more famous relative, Cinnamomum verum, but holds cultural and economic significance in its native regions."
