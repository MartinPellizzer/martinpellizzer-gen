    "intro": "Calamagrostis pseudophragmites var. rariflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered reed, is a grass species native to specific regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, with pale to greenish flowers. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
