    "intro": "Corytholoma marchii var. minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf flowered corytholoma, is a rare and small-flowered plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, small white flowers. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered with a fine layer of pubescence. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
