It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking white flowers and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its bark contains alkaloids, though it is not as well-known for medicinal properties as other cinchona species. Cinchona discolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections."
