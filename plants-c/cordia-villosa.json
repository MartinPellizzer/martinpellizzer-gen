    "intro": "Cordia villosa, commonly known as the woolly cordia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but generally not considered palatable by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Cordia villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
