It features small, alternate leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the summer, which are followed by dry, triangular seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along streambanks. Its botanical characteristics make it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions."
