    "intro": "Campanula glomerata subsp. maleevii, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It features showy, bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense flowering clusters and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other campanula species."
