    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri subsp. micrantha, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a fine pubescence, aiding in water retention. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
