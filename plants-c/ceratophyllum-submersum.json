    "intro": "Ceratophyllum submersum, commonly known as water fir, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Africa, Australia, and parts of Asia. It has a branching, bushy structure with small, scale-like leaves that are often mistaken for roots. The plant lacks true stems and leaves, instead having a compact, dense growth form that provides habitat for aquatic organisms. It reproduces through vegetative propagation, with new shoots forming at the base of the plant. Ceratophyllum submersum is often used in aquariums and pond ecosystems due to its ability to oxygenate water and control algae growth."
