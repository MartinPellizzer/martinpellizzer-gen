    "intro": "Ctenitis longivillosa, commonly known as the long-hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive hairy appearance, particularly on the underside of its fronds, which gives it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The fronds are used in traditional medicine and basket weaving in some cultures."
