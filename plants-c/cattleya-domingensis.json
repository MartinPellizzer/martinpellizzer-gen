    "intro": "Cattleya domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Dominican Republic. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Cattleya domingensis is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
