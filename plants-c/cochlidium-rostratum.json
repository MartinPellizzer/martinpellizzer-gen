    "intro": "Cochlidium rostratum, commonly known as the rostrated snail, is a small terrestrial gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Helicidae. It is characterized by its spiral shell, which is typically light-colored with a reddish or brownish hue. The species is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and gardens. Its diet primarily consists of decaying plant matter, contributing to nutrient cycling in its habitat. The shell provides protection against predators and desiccation, making it an important adaptation for survival."
