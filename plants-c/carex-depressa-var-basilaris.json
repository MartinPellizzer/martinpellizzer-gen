    "intro": "Carex depressa var. basilaris, commonly known as the basal sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It typically forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous brown flowers in late summer, which are arranged in spike-like clusters. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions, making it a common sight in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small organisms, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
