    "intro": "Calandrinia villanuevae, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, which open in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its rapid growth and ability to reseed itself make it a common weed in disturbed soils."
