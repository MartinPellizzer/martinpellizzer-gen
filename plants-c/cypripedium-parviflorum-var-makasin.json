    "intro": "Cypripedium parviflorum var. makasin, commonly known as the Makasin lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like flower that is typically pink or white with a yellow throat. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces a single, showy bloom each year. Its leaves are broad and oval, often with a waxy texture, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered in many areas."
