    "intro": "Ctenopteris sparsipilosa, commonly known as the sparse-hairs fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Ctenopteris sparsipilosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
