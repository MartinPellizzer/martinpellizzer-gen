    "intro": "Cousinia fedtschenkoana, commonly known as the Tibetan hare's foot, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features dense clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically silver-gray, covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Cousinia fedtschenkoana is well adapted to cold, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows."
