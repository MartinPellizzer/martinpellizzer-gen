    "intro": "Coppensia alvesiana, commonly known as the Alvesian heath, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of southeastern Brazil. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes many shrubs and small trees adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, evergreen leaves, and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, acidic environments and is often found in areas with high humidity and partial shade. Due to habitat loss, Coppensia alvesiana is considered a rare and endangered species."
