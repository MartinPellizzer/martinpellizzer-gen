    "intro": "Cantua alutacea, commonly known as the Alpine buttonweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its flowers are typically clustered at the base of the plant, forming a distinctive button-like shape. Cantua alutacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific soil and climate requirements."
