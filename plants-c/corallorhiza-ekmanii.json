    "intro": "Corallorhiza ekmanii, commonly known as the pink bee orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies on fungi for its nutrients. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which provide the plant with essential nutrients. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in many areas, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
