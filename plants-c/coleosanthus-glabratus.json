    "intro": "Coleosanthus glabratus, commonly known as the smooth leaved sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is characterized by its fleshy, smooth-textured leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in saline environments and is often found growing along rocky shores or in tidal zones. Its floral structure attracts pollinators such as bees and birds, contributing to its ecological significance in coastal ecosystems. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture due to its striking appearance and adaptability to coastal conditions."
