    "intro": "Carex subpumila, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in shaded or partially shaded environments such as woodlands or wetlands. Carex subpumila produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
