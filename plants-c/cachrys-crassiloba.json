    "intro": "Cachrys crassiloba, commonly known as the thick-leaved lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, leathery thallus with a dark green to blackish upper surface and a white to pale yellow lower surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to absorb nutrients from the environment. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it an indicator of environmental stability and air quality."
