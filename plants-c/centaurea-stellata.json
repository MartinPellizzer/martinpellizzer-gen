    "intro": "Centaurea stellata, commonly known as the star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is an annual or biennial herb characterized by its spiny leaves and bright purple or blue flowers that resemble stars. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its seed heads are distinctive, with bristly rays that aid in wind dispersal. Centaurea stellata is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth and ability to invade new environments."
