    "intro": "Cochranella, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia. They are characterized by their striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. Cochranella species are often found in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist climates. Due to their unique appearance and habitat, they are of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
