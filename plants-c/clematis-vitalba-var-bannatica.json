    "intro": "Clematis vitalba var. bannatica, commonly known as the Bannatic ivy, is a climbing vine native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
