    "intro": "Cleyera obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf cleyera, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea, where it typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant features broad, ovate leaves that are often glossy and dark green, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, orange-red berries. Cleyera obovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
