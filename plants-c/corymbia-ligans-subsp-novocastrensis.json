It is characterized by its smooth, grey to reddish bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are lance-shaped, glossy green on top, and pale underneath, often with a slight droop. It produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. This subspecies is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in dry, open forests and woodlands."
