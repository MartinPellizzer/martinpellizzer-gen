    "intro": "Cyperus confertus var. biuncialis, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a tight, cylindrical cluster. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
