    "intro": "Chaelothilus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has no leaves, relying instead on its specialized roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are small, white, and highly fragrant, blooming in late summer. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often found in swamp forests and pine flatwoods."
