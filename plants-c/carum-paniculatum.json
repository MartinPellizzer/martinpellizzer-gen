It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces umbrella-like clusters of flowers, a feature common in the carrot family. Its leaves are often used as a herb in cooking, adding a delicate anise-like flavor. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks."
