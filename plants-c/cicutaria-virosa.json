    "intro": "Cicutaria virosa, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and oval, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. These berries contain toxic alkaloids, making the plant highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
