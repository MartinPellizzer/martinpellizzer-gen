    "intro": "Cynanchum folotsioides, commonly known as African snakeroot, is a perennial herb native to sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic alkaloids. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and yellowish-green. Due to its toxic properties, it is used traditionally in some regions for medicinal purposes, though caution is required when handling it."
