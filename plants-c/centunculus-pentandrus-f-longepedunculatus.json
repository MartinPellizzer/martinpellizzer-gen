    "intro": "Centunculus pentandrus f. longepedunculatus, commonly known as the long pedunculate starwort, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant belonging to the Montiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant features a slender, elongated peduncle that supports its clustered inflorescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to southern Europe, it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
