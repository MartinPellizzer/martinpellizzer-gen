    "intro": "Chionochloa rubra, commonly known as the red mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Southern Hemisphere, particularly found in New Zealand. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive reddish-purple coloration, especially in its inflorescence. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a dense, mat-forming structure that helps it withstand harsh climatic conditions. Chionochloa rubra plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine flora and fauna."
