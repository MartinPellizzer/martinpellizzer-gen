    "intro": "Chaetochloa intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or saturated soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, while its dense growth provides habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Chaetochloa intermedia is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in poorly drained soils."
