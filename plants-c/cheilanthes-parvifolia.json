    "intro": "Cheilanthes parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction. This resilient fern is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant."
