    "intro": "Clidemia carassana, commonly known as the velvetleaf or white mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the growing season. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Clidemia carassana is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it a potential invasive species in certain regions."
