    "intro": "Cypripedium calceolus, commonly known as the lady's slipper orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a unique pouch-like structure at the base of the petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and mountainous areas. Its leaves are usually broad and oval, and it produces a single flower per stem. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
