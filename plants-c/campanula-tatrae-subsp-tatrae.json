    "intro": "Campanula tatrae subsp. tatrae, commonly known as the Tatra bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Tatra Mountains in Central Europe. It is characterized by its bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations. Its leaves are basal, hairy, and somewhat lobed, adapting to the harsh mountain climate. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
