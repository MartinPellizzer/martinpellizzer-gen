    "intro": "Croton guaraniticus f. microphyllus, commonly known as the miniature croton, is a compact shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically a vibrant green, with some varieties displaying variegation. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by reddish-brown, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in indoor and greenhouse settings."
