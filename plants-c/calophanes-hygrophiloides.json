    "intro": "Calophanes hygrophiloides, commonly known as the water-loving orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in marshy areas, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in consistently moist to aquatic conditions. The plant features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, typically displaying shades of white, green, or pale yellow. Calophanes hygrophiloides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
