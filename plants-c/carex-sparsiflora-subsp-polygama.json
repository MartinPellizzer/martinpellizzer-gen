It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
