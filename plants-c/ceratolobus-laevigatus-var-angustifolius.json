    "intro": "Ceratolobus laevigatus var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandblush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grey hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that appear in clusters, often during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found growing on sandy or gravelly soils. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various native insects and small animals."
