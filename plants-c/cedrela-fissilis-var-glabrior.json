    "intro": "Cedrela fissilis var. glabrior, commonly known as Brazilian cedar or mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its straight, durable wood with a fine, even grain, making it highly valued in the furniture and construction industries. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, often with a glossy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Due to its economic importance, it is also classified as a threatened species in some regions."
