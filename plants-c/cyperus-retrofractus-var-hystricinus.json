    "intro": "Cyperus retrofractus var. hystricinus, commonly known as the spiny flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering spikes are usually pale to dark brown, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variant is distinguished by its spiny bracts, which give it its common name and contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
