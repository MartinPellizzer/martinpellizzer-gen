    "intro": "Cynorkis tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun. It is a perennial herb that produces a single flowering stem each year. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in arid or semi-arid regions."
