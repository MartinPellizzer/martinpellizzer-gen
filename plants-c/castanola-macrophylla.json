    "intro": "Castanola macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can span up to three meters in diameter, which float on the water's surface. The plant's roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its stems extend upward to support the foliage. Its flowers, which bloom at night, are white and emit a fragrant scent to attract pollinators. Castanola macrophylla plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
