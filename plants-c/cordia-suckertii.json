    "intro": "Cordia suckertii, commonly known as the African bead tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance. The tree is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in local crafts and construction."
