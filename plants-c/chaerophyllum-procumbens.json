    "intro": "Chaerophyllum procumbens, commonly known as\u530d\u5310\u9999\u8349 (creeping sweet clover), is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs such as carrots and parsley. The plant features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its small, white or greenish-white flowers appear in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the umbelliferous plants. The leaves are finely divided and emit a mild, aromatic scent when crushed."
