    "intro": "Convolvulus ammannii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a trailing perennial vine that produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has hairy, slender stems and heart-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name."
