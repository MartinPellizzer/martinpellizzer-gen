    "intro": "Calanthe tahitensis var. marquisensis, commonly known as the Marquesan calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the islands of French Polynesia. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest undergrowth. Its flowers bloom during the wet season, adding a delicate beauty to the local flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
