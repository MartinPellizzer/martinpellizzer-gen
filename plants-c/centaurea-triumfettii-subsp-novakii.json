    "intro": "Centaurea triumfettii subsp. novakii, commonly known as the Novak's cornflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. It produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
