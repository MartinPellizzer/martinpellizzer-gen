    "intro": "Cakile maritima var. susica, commonly known as the Mediterranean sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found along rocky shores and dunes. The plant features basal rosettes of pinnately divided, fleshy leaves that are covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. This variety is adapted to harsh coastal environments and plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
