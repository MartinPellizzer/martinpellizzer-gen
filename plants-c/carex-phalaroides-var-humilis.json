    "intro": "Carex phalaroides var. humilis, commonly known as the low sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in consistently moist to water-saturated soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture, and it produces small, clustered flower heads in late summer. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
