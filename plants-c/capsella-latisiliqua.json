    "intro": "Capsella latisiliqua, commonly known as the broad-leaved weed or broadleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into spherical, dry fruits called capsules. Its botanical features include a hairy stem and a distinctive leaf morphology that aids in identification. Capsella latisiliqua is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
