    "intro": "Coffea arabica var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the rounded-leaf arabica, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variant of the coffee plant. It is characterized by its distinctive rounded leaves, which set it apart from the more typical oval-shaped leaves of standard Arabica varieties. This subspecies is native to the highlands of Ethiopia, where it thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil. It produces small, red berries containing two seeds, which are used to make coffee. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of particular interest to botanists and coffee enthusiasts alike."
