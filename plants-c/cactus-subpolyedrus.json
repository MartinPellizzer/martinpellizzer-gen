    "intro": "Cactus subpolyedrus, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It features a cylindrical stem with prominent, narrow ribs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its spines are short and sparse, providing minimal protection but allowing for efficient photosynthesis. Overall, Cactus subpolyedrus is well adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal water and nutrients."
