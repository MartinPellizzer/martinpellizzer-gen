    "intro": "Cerastium fontanum subsp. alpicum, commonly known as alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas where it contributes to the local flora. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
