    "intro": "Callitriche pedunculata f. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable water starwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its submerged or floating leaves that are often alternate and vary in shape, contributing to its common name. The plant typically produces small, white or pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its morphological variation, particularly in leaf structure, is a notable feature of this botanical variant."
