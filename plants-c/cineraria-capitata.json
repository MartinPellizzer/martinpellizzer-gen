    "intro": "Cineraria capitata, commonly known as the blueweed or sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has a rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Cineraria capitata is often found growing in coastal areas and rocky soils due to its tolerance for salty and well-drained environments. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
