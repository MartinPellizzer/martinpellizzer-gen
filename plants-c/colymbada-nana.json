    "intro": "Colymbada nana, commonly known as the dwarf marsh orchid, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 20 cm, with slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces oval, greenish-brown capsules as fruits. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated ground. Colymbada nana is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its simple, linear leaves and delicate floral structure."
