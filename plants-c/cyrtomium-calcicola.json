    "intro": "Cyrtomium calcicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to arid and rocky environments in southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, clumping growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled or rolled. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds. Cyrtomium calcicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh, dry conditions."
