    "intro": "Chionogentias sylvicola, commonly known as the snow gentian, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
