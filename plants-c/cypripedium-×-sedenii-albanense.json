    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 sedenii albanense, commonly known as the Albanian lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, typically pink or white in color. The plant has a tall, erect stem with few leaves and produces a single or occasionally two flowers per stem. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
