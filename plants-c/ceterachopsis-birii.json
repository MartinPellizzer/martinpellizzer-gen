    "intro": "Ceterachopsis birii, commonly known as the New Zealand sea holly, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like inflorescence. The plant thrives in rocky, coastal habitats and is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray. Its small, white flowers bloom in spring, adding a delicate beauty to its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
