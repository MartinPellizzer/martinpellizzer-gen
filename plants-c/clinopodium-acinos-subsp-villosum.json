It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant is distinguished by its dense, soft, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in whorled clusters. This subspecies is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
