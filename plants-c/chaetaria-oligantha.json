    "intro": "Chaetaria oligantha, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a small perennial grass native to southern Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with fine, hairy leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is valued for its ornamental appeal in certain horticultural settings."
