    "intro": "Catapodium fusiforme, commonly known as the narrowleaf catapodium, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils. Catapodium fusiforme plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
