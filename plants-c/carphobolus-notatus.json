    "intro": "Carphobolus notatus, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often shiny and dark green, with a distinctive arrowhead shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in clusters during the spring. Its root system is fibrous and can spread moderately, making it somewhat invasive in certain regions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
