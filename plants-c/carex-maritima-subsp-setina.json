    "intro": "Carex maritima subsp. setina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal and brackish wetlands. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers. This subspecies is adapted to saline and waterlogged soils, making it a common sight in estuaries and tidal marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. The plant plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to soil structure and nutrient cycling."
