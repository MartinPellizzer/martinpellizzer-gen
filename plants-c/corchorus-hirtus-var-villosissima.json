    "intro": "Corchorus hirtus var. villosissima, commonly known as the hairy dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered in dense, soft hairs. The leaves are large, heart-shaped, and also hairy, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. This plant is often found in moist soils along riverbanks, wet meadows, and disturbed sites, and is valued for its historical use in textile production."
