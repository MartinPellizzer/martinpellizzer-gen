    "intro": "Cardopatium atractyloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a basal rosette that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in shallow water or damp soils, making it a characteristic species of marshes and pond edges. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
