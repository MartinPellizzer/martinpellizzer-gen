It is native to China and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or marshy environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
