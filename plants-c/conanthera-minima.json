    "intro": "Conanthera minima, commonly known as the dwarf lily of the Nile, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its small size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for water gardens and bog landscapes."
