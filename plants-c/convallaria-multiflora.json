    "intro": "Convallaria multiflora, commonly known as lily of the valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to western Europe and parts of northern Asia. It features fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that are opposite and oval in shape. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in woodland areas. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of cardiac glycosides."
