    "intro": "Clematis pitcheri var. filifera, commonly known as the filifera clematis, is a rare and unique variant of the clematis genus native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, vine-like growth habit and its ability to climb by means of tendrils. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with delicate, feathery foliage that adds to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
