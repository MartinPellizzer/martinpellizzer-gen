    "intro": "Crataegus peckii, commonly known as Peck's hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers in the spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, including moist to dry conditions. Crataegus peckii is often found in woodlands, along stream banks, and in open fields."
