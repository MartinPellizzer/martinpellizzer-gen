It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, tuberous roots and delicate, trailing stems. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Ceropegia triebneri is popular as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
