    "intro": "Crassula elegans subsp. elegans, commonly known as the \"Lamb's Ear\" or \"Elegant Crassula,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy, silver-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact growth habit and low water requirements. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it drought-tolerant and easy to care for."
