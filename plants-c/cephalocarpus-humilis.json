    "intro": "Cephalocarpus humilis, commonly known as the lowland cephalocarp, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, three-lobed capsules that encase its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cephalocarpus humilis is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
