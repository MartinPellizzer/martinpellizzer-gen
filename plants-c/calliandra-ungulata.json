It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery, bipinnate leaves and showy, clustered pink or red flowers. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in agroforestry systems for its nitrogen-fixing ability. Calliandra ungulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in traditional medicine."
