It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, supporting its growth in moist, shaded conditions. The fronds are typically green and can reach lengths of up to several meters, making it a striking addition to its natural habitat."
