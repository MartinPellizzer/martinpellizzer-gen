    "intro": "Chaenactis nevii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy, silver-gray foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine meadows. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chaenactis nevii is considered a rare and sensitive species."
