    "intro": "Crypsis tenella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption, as it lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. Its specialized structure allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Crypsis tenella is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
