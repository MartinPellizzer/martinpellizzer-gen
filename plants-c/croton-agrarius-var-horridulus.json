    "intro": "Croton agrarius var. horridulus, commonly known as the spiny croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces elliptical, orange to red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its hairy, spiny stems and leaves make it easily distinguishable from other Croton species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
