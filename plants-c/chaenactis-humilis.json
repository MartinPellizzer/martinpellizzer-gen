    "intro": "Chaenactis humilis, commonly known as the dwarf rayhead, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically features a basal rosette of narrow, silvery-blue leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and appear in clusters, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Chaenactis humilis is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
