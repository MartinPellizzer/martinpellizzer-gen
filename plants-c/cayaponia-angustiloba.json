    "intro": "Cayaponia angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cayaponia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features elongated, narrow leaves with a soft, velvety texture, and its flowers are typically pink or purple, clustered in inflorescences. It is often found in lowland forests and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
