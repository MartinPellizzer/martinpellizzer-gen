    "intro": "Cyperus filiformis f. filifolius, commonly known as the threadleaf flatsedge, is a compact, mat-forming perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale brown flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which are borne on short, leafless stems. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, swamps, or along the edges of ponds. Its narrow leaves and compact growth habit make it a unique addition to aquatic or bog gardens."
