    "intro": "Claoxylon biciliatum, commonly known as the two-ribbed sandpaper tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, sandpaper-like bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest in both horticulture and conservation efforts."
