    "intro": "Calamagrostis tweedyi, commonly known as Tweedy's reed grass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant features slender, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Calamagrostis tweedyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
