    "intro": "Corydalis rupestris, commonly known as the rock corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine environments. The plant produces delicate, spurred flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. Corydalis rupestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging, well-drained conditions."
