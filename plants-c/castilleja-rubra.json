    "intro": "Castilleja rubra, commonly known as scarlet Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, brush-like inflorescences that attract pollinators. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients through its haustoria. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Castilleja rubra plays an important ecological role by providing nectar to bees and other pollinators."
