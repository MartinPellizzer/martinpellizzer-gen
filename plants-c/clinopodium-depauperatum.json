    "intro": "Clinopodium depauperatum, commonly known as slender wood betony, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, and it is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora. Clinopodium depauperatum is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological preferences."
