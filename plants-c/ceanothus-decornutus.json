It is characterized by its narrow, evergreen leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and sunny habitats, such as coastal bluffs and chaparral areas. It is well adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in regions with limited rainfall. Ceanothus decornutus plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native environment."
