    "intro": "Combretum recurvatum, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which are typically borne in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
