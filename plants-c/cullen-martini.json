    "intro": "Cullen martini, commonly known as the \"Cullen Martini,\" is a cocktail that does not contain any botanical ingredients in its traditional formulation. However, the name may be misleading, as it is not related to any specific plant or botanical component. The cocktail typically consists of gin and dry vermouth, with optional additions like a lemon twist or olive. While it does not rely on botanicals for its flavor, it is often associated with the Cullen Restaurant in San Francisco, which popularized the drink. This distinction highlights the importance of understanding the difference between a cocktail's name and its actual botanical composition."
