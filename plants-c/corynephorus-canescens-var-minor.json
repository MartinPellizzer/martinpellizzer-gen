It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features narrow, silver-haired leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with brown or reddish hues. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grassy areas.
