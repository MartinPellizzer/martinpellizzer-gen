    "intro": "Cleyera angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf cleyera, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features opposite, elliptic to lanceolate leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Cleyera angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its foliage and seasonal interest. It prefers partial shade to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a versatile choice for woodland or landscape settings."
