    "intro": "Colocynthis amarissima, commonly known as the bitter apple or wild cucumber, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers, pumpkins, and gourds. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers followed by spiny, orange-yellow fruits that mature in the autumn. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are woody and branched. The fruit contains a toxic, bitter pulp and seeds, making it unsuitable for human consumption but valuable in traditional medicine."
