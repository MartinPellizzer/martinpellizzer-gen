    "intro": "Comesperma ericinum f. uncinatum, commonly known as the hooked form of the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are often adorned with hooked hairs, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This form is a variation of the main species, characterized by its unique leaf morphology and ecological resilience."
