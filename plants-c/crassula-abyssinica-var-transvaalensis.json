It features dense, low-growing clusters of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact growth habit makes it an ideal choice for rock gardens or as a container plant."
