    "intro": "Carex pinguis, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically broad and flat, with a distinct central vein. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Carex pinguis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
