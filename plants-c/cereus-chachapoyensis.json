    "intro": "Cereus chachapoyensis, commonly known as the Chachapoya Cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of Peru and Ecuador. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, spiny stems and ability to thrive in high-altitude environments. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that are often fragrant. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in its native habitat."
