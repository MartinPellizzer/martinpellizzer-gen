    "intro": "Cynodon tenellus, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and coarse, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue or purple flowers. It thrives in warm, dry climates and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Cynodon tenellus is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in erosion control and forage production."
