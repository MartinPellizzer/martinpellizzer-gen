    "intro": "Crassocephalum subscandens, commonly known as the spider plant or stinging nettle, is a tropical flowering plant native to Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows up to 1.5 meters in height, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by spherical, pale green seed pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its stinging hairs, it can be a nuisance to handle but is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
