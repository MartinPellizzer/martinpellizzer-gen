    "intro": "Cereus strausii, commonly known as the Straus' candleplant, is a flowering cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces large, white, nocturnal flowers that bloom at night, attracting moths. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Its unique morphology and nocturnal blooming make it a striking and interesting species for botanical study."
