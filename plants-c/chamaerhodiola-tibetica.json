    "intro": "Chamaerhodiola tibetica, commonly known as Tibetan rosemary, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs. It is well adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its resilience and unique appearance, it is of interest to both botanists and horticulturists."
