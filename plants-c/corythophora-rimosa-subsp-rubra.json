    "intro": "Corythophora rimosa subsp. rubra, commonly known as the red-stemmed rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that are typically reddish in color, especially when young. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in spike-like inflorescences, which appear in late summer. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and along waterways. Its fibrous roots and sturdy stems make it an important species in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
