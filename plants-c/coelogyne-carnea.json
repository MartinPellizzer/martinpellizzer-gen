    "intro": "Coelogyne carnea, commonly known as the Crimson Lady orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red flowers with yellow and green streaks, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in seasonal climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Coelogyne carnea is prized in horticulture for its beauty and is often cultivated in shaded, well-drained environments."
