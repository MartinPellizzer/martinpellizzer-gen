    "intro": "Cyperus diandrus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive, umbrella-shaped inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, making it a common sight in wetlands and along water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Cyperus diandrus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
