    "intro": "Coronilla trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaf vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils. The plant features trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being oval to lance-shaped. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in early spring. The plant is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
