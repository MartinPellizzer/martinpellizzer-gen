    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis salicina f. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Chinese ironwood, is a rare and woody plant belonging to the Fagaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, chestnut-like fruits that are encased in a hard, woody shell. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of China and Vietnam. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
