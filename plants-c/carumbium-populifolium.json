    "intro": "Carumbium populifolium, commonly known as the poplar-leaf carumbium, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of poplar trees, hence its common name. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny seeds carried by the wind. Carumbium populifolium is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
