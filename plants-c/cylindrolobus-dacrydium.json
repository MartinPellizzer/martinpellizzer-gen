    "intro": "Cylindrolobus dacrydium, commonly known as the New Zealand mountain pine, is a unique conifer native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and needle-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, typical of coniferous species. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
