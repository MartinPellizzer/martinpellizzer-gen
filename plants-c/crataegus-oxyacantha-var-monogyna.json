    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha var. monogyna, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits called haws in the fall, which are edible but often used in jams and wines. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
