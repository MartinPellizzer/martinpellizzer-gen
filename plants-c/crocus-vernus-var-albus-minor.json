    "intro": "Crocus vernus var. albus-minor, commonly known as the white crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in woodland areas and meadows. It is closely related to other crocus species and is valued for its ornamental appeal. The flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and the plant is adapted to cool, moist climates."
