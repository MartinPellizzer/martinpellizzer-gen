    "intro": "Copiapoa gigantea var. haseltoniana, commonly known as the giant copiapoa, is a cacti species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces large, white or pink flowers during the summer months. It has a thick, ribbed structure that helps it store water, adapting to the arid environment. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water."
