    "intro": "Cerastium arvense subsp. alsinifolium, commonly known as creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a soft, hairy texture, and the flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This subspecies is characterized by its finely divided, almost grass-like leaves, distinguishing it from other members of the genus."
