    "intro": "Celsia joannis, commonly known as the Joannis celsia, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and prefers well-drained soil. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth margin, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Celsia joannis is considered a species of conservation concern."
