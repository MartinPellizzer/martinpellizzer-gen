    "intro": "Cyperus urbani, commonly known as the urban flatsedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as urban stormwater retention basins and roadside ditches. Cyperus urbani produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and filtering water in urban ecosystems."
