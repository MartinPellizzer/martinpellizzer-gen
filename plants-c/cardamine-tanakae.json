    "intro": "Cardamine tanakae, commonly known as Japanese water shield, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has distinctive heart-shaped leaves that are often floating on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. Its small white or yellowish flowers appear in clusters and bloom in early spring. Cardamine tanakae is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
