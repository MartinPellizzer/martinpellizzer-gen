    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis subsp. matthioli, commonly known as the yellow marsh cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist meadows and wetlands in Europe. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-rich, waterlogged soils. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
