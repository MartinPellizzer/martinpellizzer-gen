It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruit that resembles a long, slender beak. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a unique spurred structure, which attracts specific pollinators. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant often grows in open, sunny habitats. Crotalaria longirostrata is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking floral display."
