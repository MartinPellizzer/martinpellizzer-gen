    "intro": "Cyclostemon minahassae, commonly known as the Minahassa cycad, is a rare cycad species native to Indonesia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of cycads, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal water. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
