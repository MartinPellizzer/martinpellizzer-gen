    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris cavatocaspica, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, alternate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small white or pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, three-lobed seed pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common weed but also a valuable plant for ecological studies."
