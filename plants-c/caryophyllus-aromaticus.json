It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, purple or pink flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment. It also contains essential oils and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. However, it can be toxic if consumed in large quantities due to the presence of coumarin."
