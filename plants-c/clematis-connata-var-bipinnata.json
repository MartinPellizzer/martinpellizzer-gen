    "intro": "Clematis connata var. bipinnata, commonly known as the double-leaf clematis, is a deciduous climbing plant native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves that are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple pairs of small, feather-like leaflets. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its vigorous climbing habit makes it a popular choice for trellises and garden structures."
