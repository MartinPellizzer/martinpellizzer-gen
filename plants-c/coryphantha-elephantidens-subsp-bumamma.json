    "intro": "Coryphantha elephantidens subsp. bumamma, commonly known as the Bumamma coryphantha, is a rare and striking cactus native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
