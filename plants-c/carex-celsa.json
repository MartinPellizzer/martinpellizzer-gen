    "intro": "Carex celsa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and grass-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are often surrounded by bracts. Carex celsa thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
