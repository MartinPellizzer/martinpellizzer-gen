    "intro": "Cryptogramma densa, commonly known as the dense cryptogramma, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form with dense, closely packed leaves that are often a vibrant green. Its leaves are usually arranged in two rows, giving it a distinctive, almost geometric appearance. Cryptogramma densa plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitats."
