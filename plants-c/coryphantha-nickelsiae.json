    "intro": "Coryphantha nickelsiae, commonly known as the Nickels' coryphantha, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201315 centimeters and features a globular or cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Due to its limited range and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and protected species."
