    "intro": "Centemopsis, commonly known as the velvetleaf. It is a flowering plant in the family Malvaceae, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, Centemopsis thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal make it both ecologically significant and a potential weed."
