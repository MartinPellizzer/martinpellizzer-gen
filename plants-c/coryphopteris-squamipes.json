    "intro": "Coryphopteris squamipes, commonly known as the scaly maidenhair fern, is a delicate evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It features finely divided, arching fronds that are covered in small, scale-like structures, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are short and stout, allowing it to form dense, low-growing colonies. Coryphopteris squamipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
