    "intro": "Campylocaryum verrucosum, commonly known as the roughleaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its submerged, branching fronds that are covered in small, wart-like bumps, giving it a rough texture. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often anchored to substrates, and it produces small, inconspicuous sporangia on the underside of its fronds. This fern is valued in aquatic gardens for its unique appearance and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
