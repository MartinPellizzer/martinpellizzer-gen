The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it thrives in well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
