    "intro": "Cladium capillaceum, commonly known as the slender spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, narrow stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters, with dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Cladium capillaceum plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and water filtration."
