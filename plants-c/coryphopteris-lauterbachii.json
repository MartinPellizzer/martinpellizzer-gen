    "intro": "Coryphopteris lauterbachii, commonly known as the Lauterbach's huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its stout, wiry stems and clustered, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish hairs. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and are grouped in clusters. Coryphopteris lauterbachii is often found in rocky or forested areas, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in these ecosystems."
