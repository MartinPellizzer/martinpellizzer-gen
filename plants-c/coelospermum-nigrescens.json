    "intro": "Coelospermum nigrescens, commonly known as blackwood or blackbark, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dark, woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties. Coelospermum nigrescens is also notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an important component of certain ecosystems."
