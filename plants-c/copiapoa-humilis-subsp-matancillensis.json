    "intro": "Copiapoa humilis subsp. matancillensis, commonly known as the Matancillo cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Chile. It features a short, ribbed stem with dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
