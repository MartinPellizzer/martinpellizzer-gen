It features small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for ecological restoration projects and garden use in shady areas."
