    "intro": "Cibotium billardierei, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species native to the temperate rainforests of New Zealand. It is characterized by its massive, tree-like structure with a thick, fibrous trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant belongs to the family Dicksoniaceae and is known for its slow growth and longevity, often living for centuries. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in spore dispersal. The plant plays a vital ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various native species."
