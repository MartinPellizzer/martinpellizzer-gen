    "intro": "Centaurea axillaris var. ochroleuca, commonly known as the white-centred knapweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale yellow in color. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, often with a hairy texture, and it produces achene fruits with pappus for wind dispersal. This variety is distinguished by its lighter floral coloration compared to other Centaurea species."
