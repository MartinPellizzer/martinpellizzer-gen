    "intro": "Cerasus avium f. aspleniifolia, commonly known as the fern-leaved cherry, is a botanical variant of the sweet cherry. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits similar to those of the common cherry. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage. This form is a natural variation found in specific regions of Europe and parts of Asia."
