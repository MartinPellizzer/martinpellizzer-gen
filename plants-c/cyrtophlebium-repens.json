    "intro": "Cyrtophlebium repens, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and unique, clustered inflorescences. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a distinctive waxy texture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly sought after in conservation efforts and horticulture."
