    "intro": "Clinopodium \u00d7 thymifolium, commonly known as hybrid thyme or thyme-leaved clary, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Clinopodium umbellatum and Thymus species, exhibiting characteristics of both parents. The plant is distinguished by its aromatic, narrow leaves that resemble those of thyme, and its small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in whorled clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Clinopodium \u00d7 thymifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
