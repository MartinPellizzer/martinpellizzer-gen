    "intro": "Cuscuta racemosa var. calycina, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrition. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity. The plant has a slender, thread-like stem that wraps around its host, forming a symbiotic relationship. It is native to North America and can be found in various habitats, including disturbed soils and agricultural fields. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause damage to crops and ornamental plants."
