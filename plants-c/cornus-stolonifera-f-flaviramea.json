    "intro": "Cornus stolonifera f. flaviramea, commonly known as the golden branched cornel, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems that often display a reddish or golden hue, especially during the growing season. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. This ornamental plant is valued for its hardiness and unique appearance in rock gardens and alpine settings."
