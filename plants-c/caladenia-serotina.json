    "intro": "Caladenia serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering spider-orchid, is an orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and a single, showy pink or purple flower that resembles a spider. The plant typically blooms in late summer to autumn, and its flowers are pollinated by insects such as thynny wasps. Caladenia serotina is a terrestrial orchid that grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in heathland or open forests. It is a protected species in some regions due to habitat loss and is often found in conservation reserves."
