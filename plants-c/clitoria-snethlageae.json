It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant produces vibrant blue or purple pea-like flowers, which are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants. Its climbing habit and showy blooms make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. The seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
