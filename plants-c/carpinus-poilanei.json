    "intro": "Carpinus poilanei, commonly known as the Madagascar hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, spiky fruits. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
