    "intro": "Caragana microphylla var. megalantha, commonly known as the large-leaved shrub or megalantha caragana, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. Its leaves are broad and leathery, providing some shade and reducing water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes."
