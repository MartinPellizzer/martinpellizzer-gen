    "intro": "Cattleya autumnalis, commonly known as the autumn cattleya, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in the fall, hence its common name. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous fragrant blooms, each featuring a distinctive lip that is often more vividly colored than the rest of the flower. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, arranged in a fan shape, and it thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. Cattleya autumnalis is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
