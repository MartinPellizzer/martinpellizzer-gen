    "intro": "Calceolaria rupestris, commonly known as the rock calceolaria, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or coastal environments. The plant features showy, lip-shaped flowers that are usually violet or blue in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often hairy and adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Calceolaria rupestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
