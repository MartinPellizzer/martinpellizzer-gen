    "intro": "Citrus assamensis, commonly known as the Assam citrus or wild lemon, is a small evergreen tree native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, oval-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green fruits. The plant produces round or pear-shaped fruits with a thin, leathery rind and a sour, acidic pulp. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited commercial use, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other citrus species."
