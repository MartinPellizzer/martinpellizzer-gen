    "intro": "Carex lacustris, commonly known as the lake sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found along the edges of lakes, ponds, and streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. Its flowering spikes are usually tall and cylindrical, bearing small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex lacustris plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
