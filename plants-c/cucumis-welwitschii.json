    "intro": "Cucumis welwitschii, commonly known as the welwitsch cucumber, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola. It is a climbing vine that produces small, pale green fruits with a distinctive, warty surface. The plant is adapted to extreme drought conditions, featuring thick, fleshy leaves that store water. Its flowers are yellow and typically appear in clusters, and it is pollinated by insects. Despite its limited distribution, it holds significance in local ecosystems and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
