    "intro": "Cyrtandra polyneura, commonly known as the Koa tree, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescences and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to the volcanic soils of Hawaii. Cyrtandra polyneura plays an important ecological role in Hawaiian forests and is culturally significant to Native Hawaiians."
