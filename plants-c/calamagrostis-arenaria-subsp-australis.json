It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, tufted growth habit, often forming clumps in sandy or coastal soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to golden in color. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
