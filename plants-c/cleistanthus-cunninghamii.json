    "intro": "Cleistanthus cunninghamii, commonly known as the yellow-flowered ironwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
