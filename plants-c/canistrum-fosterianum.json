    "intro": "Canistrum fosterianum, commonly known as the Foster's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries. It is often found in areas with high humidity and partial shade. Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis."
