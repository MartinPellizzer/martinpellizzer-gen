    "intro": "Cannabis chinensis, commonly known as Chinese hemp, is a species of flowering plant in the Cannabaceae family. It is native to China and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit with large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small green flowers that contain cannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). It is cultivated for its fibers, seeds, and medicinal properties. Due to its psychoactive potential, it is subject to legal restrictions in many countries."
