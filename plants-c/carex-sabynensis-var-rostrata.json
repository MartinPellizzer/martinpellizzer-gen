    "intro": "Carex sabynensis var. rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its distinctive rostrated (beak-like) bract at the base of the flowering spike. This variety is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
