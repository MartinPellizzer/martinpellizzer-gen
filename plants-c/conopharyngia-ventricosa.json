    "intro": "Conopharyngia ventricosa, commonly known as the balloon vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that reduces water loss. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
