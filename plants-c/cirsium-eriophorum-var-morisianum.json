    "intro": "Cirsium eriophorum var. morisianum, commonly known as the Morisian thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to parts of Europe and western Asia, this plant thrives in dry, disturbed soils and open habitats. It is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in agricultural areas. Due to its aggressive growth and ability to form dense stands, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
