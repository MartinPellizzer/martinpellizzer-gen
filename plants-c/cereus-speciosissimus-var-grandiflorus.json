It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and sparse, spiny foliage. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night and emit a fragrant scent. These flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a single night. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
