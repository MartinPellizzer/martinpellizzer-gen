    "intro": "Cheilanthes regularis, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white trichomes. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent-like leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Cheilanthes regularis is a hardy species that is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
