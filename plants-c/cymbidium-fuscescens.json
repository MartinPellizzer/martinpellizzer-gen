    "intro": "Cymbidium fuscescens, commonly known as the dark green orchid, is a species native to the mountainous regions of China, particularly in Yunnan Province. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant orchid flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color, often with a slight reddish tinge. Cymbidium fuscescens thrives in cool, humid climates and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. It is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its cultural significance in traditional Chinese horticulture."
