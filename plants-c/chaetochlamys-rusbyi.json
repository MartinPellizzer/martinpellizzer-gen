    "intro": "Chaetochlamys rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring a short, upright stem and a single, showy flower with intricate, thread-like petals. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Chaetochlamys rusbyi is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
