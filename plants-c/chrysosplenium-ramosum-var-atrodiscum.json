It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to the forests of eastern North America, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a distinct, almost blackish hue on the underside, giving it its common name. It is often found in rich, humusy soil along streams and in woodland understories."
