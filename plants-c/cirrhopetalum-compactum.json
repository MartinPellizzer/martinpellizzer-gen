    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum compactum, commonly known as the compact bellflower, is a species of flowering plant in the family Campanulaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
