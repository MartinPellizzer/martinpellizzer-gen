    "intro": "Culcasia liberica, commonly known as the giant water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It features broad, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, allowing it to float on the water's surface. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rapid growth rate makes it an invasive species in many water bodies, often outcompeting native plants. Despite its ecological impact, it is valued for its ornamental beauty and traditional uses in some cultures."
