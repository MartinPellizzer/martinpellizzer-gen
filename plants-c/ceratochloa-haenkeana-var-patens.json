    "intro": "Ceratochloa haenkeana var. patens, commonly known as the spreading hairveld grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive hairy texture. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often concealed within the foliage. This variant is notable for its adaptability to arid conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes."
