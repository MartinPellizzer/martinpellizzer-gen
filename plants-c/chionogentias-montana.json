    "intro": "Chionogentias montana, commonly known as the mountain snowflower, is a rare and delicate alpine plant native to the high elevations of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
