It is characterized by its clusters of small, violet-blue berries that appear in late summer. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streambanks. The berries are a food source for birds and are also used in traditional medicine by some Native American tribes."
