    "intro": "Copaifera cearensis var. arenicola, commonly known as the arenicola copaifera, is a rare and endemic species native to the semi-arid regions of northeastern Brazil. It is a small, shrub-like plant characterized by its compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by unique, elongated seed pods. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in degraded or disturbed habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
