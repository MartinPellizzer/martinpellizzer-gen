It is a tall, slender palm characterized by its long, slender leaves and a smooth, waxy trunk. The plant thrives in high-altitude cloud forests, where it adapts to cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are often used in traditional practices, and it plays a role in local ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
