    "intro": "Corynephorus articulatus subsp. gracilis, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact, tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant typically grows in coastal and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing branches. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
