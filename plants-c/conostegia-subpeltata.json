    "intro": "Conostegia subpeltata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sand verbena, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Conostegia subpeltata is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ecological benefits."
