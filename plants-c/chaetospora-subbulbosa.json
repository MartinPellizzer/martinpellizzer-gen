    "intro": "Chaetospora subbulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous moss, is a small, terrestrial moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a compact structure with short, thick stems and closely spaced leaves that are often curved. Its spore-producing structures, called capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks. Chaetospora subbulbosa is often found in rock crevices and on tree trunks, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-poor conditions."
