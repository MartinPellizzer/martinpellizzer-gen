It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its humid, low-light environment. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinct lip that attracts pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate to high humidity for optimal growth."
