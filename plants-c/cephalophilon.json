    "intro": "Cephalophilon, commonly known as the golden crown fern, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble a crown, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forest understories. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its propagation in humid climates. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Cephalophilon is considered a valuable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
