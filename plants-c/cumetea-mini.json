    "intro": "Cumetea mini, commonly known as the miniature cumetea, is a small evergreen shrub native to specific regions of South America. It features dense, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, usually in shades of white or pale pink. Its compact size makes it suitable for container gardening and rock gardens. Due to its limited natural habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
