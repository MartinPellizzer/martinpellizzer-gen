    "intro": "Cassia occidentalis f. ovatolanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cassia, is a variant of the common cassia species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are narrower than those of the typical form. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sunlight. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
