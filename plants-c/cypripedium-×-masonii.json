    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 masonii, commonly known as the Mason's lady's tresses, is a hybrid orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, spiraled inflorescence composed of numerous small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Cypripedium \u00d7 masonii is a protected species due to habitat loss and over-collection."
