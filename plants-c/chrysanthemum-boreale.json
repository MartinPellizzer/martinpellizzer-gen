    "intro": "Chrysanthemum boreale, commonly known as the alpine chrysanthemum, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and the stems are covered in fine hairs. Chrysanthemum boreale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
