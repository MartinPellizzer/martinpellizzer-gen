    "intro": "Circaea lutetiana subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. The species is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in its native habitats."
