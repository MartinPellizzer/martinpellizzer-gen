    "intro": "Caladenia denticulata subsp. albicans, commonly known as the white-streaked spider orchid, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, spider-like flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale or white streaking on the dorsal sepal and petals, which sets it apart from other members of the species. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open forests or heathlands. The plant produces a single, narrow leaf and blooms from late autumn to early spring."
