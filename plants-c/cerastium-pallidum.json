It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance.
