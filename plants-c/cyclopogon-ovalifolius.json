    "intro": "Cyclopogon ovalifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cyclopogon, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
