    "intro": "Carex echinata subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bulblet sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are often thick and fleshy, contributing to its ability to thrive in saturated soils. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
