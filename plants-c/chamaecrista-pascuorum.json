    "intro": "Chamaecrista pascuorum, commonly known as the meadow ticktrefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Chamaecrista pascuorum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
