It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring or early summer. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds.
