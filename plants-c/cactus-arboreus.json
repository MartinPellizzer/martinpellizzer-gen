    "intro": "Cactus arboreus, commonly known as the tree cactus, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features a branched stem that can grow up to 10 meters tall, resembling a tree. The plant has spiny, cylindrical stems covered in areoles, which are specialized structures for producing spines, flowers, and branches. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Cactus arboreus is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions."
