    "intro": "Cardamine amporitana, commonly known as the alpine watercress, is a small herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many edible and economically important plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and often covered in a dense layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and flies."
