    "intro": "Crassula erosula, commonly known as the Campfire Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are often tinged with red or pink, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves. Crassula erosula is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
