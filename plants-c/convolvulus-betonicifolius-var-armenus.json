    "intro": "Convolvulus betonicifolius var. armenus, commonly known as Armenian bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, hairy stems, and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
