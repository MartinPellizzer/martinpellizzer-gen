    "intro": "Couepia surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam couepia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its woody structure and showy flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with smooth, often glabrous bark. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with five petals and are arranged in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
