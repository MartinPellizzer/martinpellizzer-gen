    "intro": "Capsella pinnatofoliosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved weed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and pinnately divided leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, typical of the mustard family. Its seeds are small and capsule-like, dispersing easily by wind. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in agricultural fields."
