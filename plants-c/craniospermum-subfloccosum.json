    "intro": "Craniospermum subfloccosum, commonly known as the woolly skullcap, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations."
