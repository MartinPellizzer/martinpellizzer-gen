    "intro": "Celastrus parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved staffvetch, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in the spring. The plant bears orange-red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in woodland edges and moist soils, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. Celastrus parvifolius is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
