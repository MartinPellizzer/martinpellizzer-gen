It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, typically found growing on rocky slopes and in coastal areas. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Coccoloba declinata is adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray and sandy soils."
