    "intro": "Clusia cochliformis, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking visual appeal. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its tolerance to poor soil conditions. Clusia cochliformis is also valued for its air-purifying properties and its use in traditional medicine."
