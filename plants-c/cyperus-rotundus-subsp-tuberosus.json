    "intro": "Cyperus rotundus subsp. tuberosus, commonly known as nut sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, triangular leaves that are often mistaken for grass. The plant forms tubers underground, which are edible and used in various traditional cuisines. It thrives in wet or moist soils and is often found in marshy areas or along waterways. Due to its invasive nature, it can become a significant weed in agricultural and aquatic environments."
