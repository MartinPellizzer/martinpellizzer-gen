    "intro": "Chironia serpyllifolia, commonly known as sheep's sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its smooth, succulent leaves that are typically heart-shaped and have a reddish or purple tinge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Chironia serpyllifolia is known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to their high oxalic acid content."
