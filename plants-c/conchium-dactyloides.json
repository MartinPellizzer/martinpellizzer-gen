It features a basal rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, often arranged in a cluster at the end of leafy stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Conchium dactyloides is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats that can dominate certain habitats."
