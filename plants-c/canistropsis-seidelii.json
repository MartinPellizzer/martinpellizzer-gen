    "intro": "Canistropsis seidelii, commonly known as the Seidel's canistropsis, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive, spurred shape that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
