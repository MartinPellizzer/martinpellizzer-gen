    "intro": "Cybianthus lineatus, commonly known as the slender sandverbena, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, branching stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, pink to purple flowers bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Cybianthus lineatus is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
