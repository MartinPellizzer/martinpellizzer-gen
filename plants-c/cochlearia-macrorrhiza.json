    "intro": "Cochlearia macrorrhiza, commonly known as the large-lobed scurvygrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants, and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight in maritime environments. Its leaves are often lobed and have a slightly succulent texture, while its flowers are arranged in a single terminal cluster. Cochlearia macrorrhiza is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
