It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within primary lowland rainforests. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth surface and a glossy texture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Castroa calimaniana is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
