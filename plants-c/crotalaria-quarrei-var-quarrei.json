It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with compound leaves and produces yellow or orange flowers that are often surrounded by bracts. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, making it a valuable plant in certain ecological contexts. However, it can also be invasive in some areas, posing challenges to native flora."
