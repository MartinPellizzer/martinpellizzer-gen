    "intro": "Comarum supinum, commonly known as the creeping water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has slender, floating or submerged stems with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens, and they appear in late spring to early summer. Comarum supinum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
