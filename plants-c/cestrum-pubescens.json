    "intro": "Cestrum pubescens, commonly known as the night-blooming coffee plant, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. Cestrum pubescens produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste."
