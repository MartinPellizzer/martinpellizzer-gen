    "intro": "Cuphea ramulosa, commonly known as the woolly cuphea, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink, often attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental plants. Cuphea ramulosa is relatively drought-tolerant once established, though it benefits from regular watering during dry periods."
