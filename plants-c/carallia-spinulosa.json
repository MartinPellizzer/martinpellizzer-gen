    "intro": "Carallia spinulosa, commonly known as the prickly coralroot, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is notable for its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Carallia spinulosa plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
