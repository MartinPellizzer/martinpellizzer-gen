It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in dry grasslands and disturbed soils. Its latex-like sap, which is milky when broken, gives it its common name. This plant is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
