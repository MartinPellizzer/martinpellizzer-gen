    "intro": "Caesalpinia bijuga, commonly known as the African flame bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its bright red, feathery inflorescences and bipinnate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are sometimes used as a food source. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Caesalpinia bijuga is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility in agricultural settings."
