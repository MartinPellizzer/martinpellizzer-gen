    "intro": "Celosia staticodes, commonly known as the flame flower or crown of thorns, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers at the base of the bracts, which are often overlooked. Celosia staticodes thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its drought tolerance and ability to bloom throughout the growing season add to its appeal in both garden and container settings."
