    "intro": "Caesalpinia egena, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange floral clusters that resemble flames, hence its common name. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its flowers are typically borne in dense, terminal panicles, and it produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds. Caesalpinia egena is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
