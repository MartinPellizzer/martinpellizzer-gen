    "intro": "Clusia peninsulae, commonly known as the Peninsula Clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae, also known as the genus Euphorbiaceae, and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often surrounded by brightly colored bracts. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline environments, making it a hardy and resilient species. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and landscapes in tropical and subtropical regions."
