    "intro": "Costularia natalensis, commonly known as Natal costularia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural habitat."
