    "intro": "Cyathea polliculi, commonly known as the small-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the surrounding substrate. Cyathea polliculi is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
