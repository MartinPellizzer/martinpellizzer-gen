    "intro": "Carex chimaphila, commonly known as the silver-sedge, is a perennial plant native to the northeastern United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces distinctive, spiky seed heads. Carex chimaphila is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
