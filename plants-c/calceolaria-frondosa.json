    "intro": "Calceolaria frondosa, commonly known as the frondose hooded orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive calyces, which resemble small hoods or cups, and its showy, spurred flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its compact appearance. Calceolaria frondosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral structure."
