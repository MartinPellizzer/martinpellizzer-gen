    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris microcarpa, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers with four petals, which are followed by triangular, heart-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It is native to Europe and Asia but has been naturalized in many parts of the world, including North America. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
