It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky slopes. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Cerastium glaberrimum is often found in disturbed soils and can spread readily through vegetative means."
