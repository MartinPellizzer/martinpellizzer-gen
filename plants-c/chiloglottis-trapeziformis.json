    "intro": "Chiloglottis trapeziformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf duck orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to eastern Australia. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, strap-like leaves that are usually dark green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often hidden among its foliage, making them difficult to spot. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage for optimal growth. This orchid is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
