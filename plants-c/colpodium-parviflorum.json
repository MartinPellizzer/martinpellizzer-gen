    "intro": "Colpodium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flower colpodium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of its family, while its fruit is a small, dry schizocarp that splits into two parts when mature. Colpodium parviflorum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
