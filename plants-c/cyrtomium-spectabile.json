    "intro": "Cyrtomium spectabile, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It features delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive golden hue on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to soil or rock surfaces. Cyrtomium spectabile is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in partial shade."
