    "intro": "Calamagrostis sylvatica var. viridula, commonly known as the green silky grass or green sedge, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
