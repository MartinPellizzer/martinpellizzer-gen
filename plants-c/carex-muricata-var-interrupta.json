    "intro": "Carex muricata var. interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted rough sedgeland, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage with sharp, spiky edges, and it typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and wet meadows. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland areas. It is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
