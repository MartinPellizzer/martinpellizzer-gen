    "intro": "Cyathea mutica, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy scales. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea mutica typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rainforests. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
