    "intro": "Cerbera laurifolia, commonly known as the African snowball, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of white, waxy flowers that resemble small snowballs. The plant produces small, red berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially hazardous to animals and humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though care must be taken due to its toxic properties."
