    "intro": "Cleome arenitensis, commonly known as desert cleome, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cleome arenitensis is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Its rapid growth and ability to bloom quickly make it a notable species in xerophytic ecosystems."
