    "intro": "Castilleja mcvaughii, commonly known as the McVaugh's paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic relationship with other plants. The plant produces vibrant red to orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, and it lacks true roots, relying on its host for nutrients. Castilleja mcvaughii thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert or arid environments."
