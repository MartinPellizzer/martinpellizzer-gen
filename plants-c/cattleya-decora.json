    "intro": "Cattleya decora, commonly known as the Decorator Cattleya, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Cattleya decora is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
