    "intro": "Corbularia bulbocodium var. clusii, commonly known as the Clusius's bulbocodium, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous root system and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces clusters of white or pale pink blooms during the spring and early summer. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
