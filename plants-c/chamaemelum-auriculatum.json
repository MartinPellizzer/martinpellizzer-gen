    "intro": "Chamaemelum auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in meadows and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it identifiable by its distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) leaf bases and its composite flower structure."
