    "intro": "Cortia vaginata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Cortia vaginata is often found in moist, disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain regions."
