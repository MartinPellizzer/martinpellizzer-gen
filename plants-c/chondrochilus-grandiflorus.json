    "intro": "Chondrochilus grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered rock orchid, is a perennial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches in tropical rainforests, relying on its roots for attachment and nutrient absorption. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive yellow-green coloration and intricate patterns. Its leaves are leathery and arranged in a rosette, aiding in water retention in its humid habitat. Chondrochilus grandiflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
