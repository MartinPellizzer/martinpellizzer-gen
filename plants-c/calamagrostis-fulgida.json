    "intro": "Calamagrostis fulgida, commonly known as the golden reed, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a golden hue. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual element to the landscape. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control. Calamagrostis fulgida is well-suited for wet or moist soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
