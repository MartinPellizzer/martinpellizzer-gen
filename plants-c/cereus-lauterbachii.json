    "intro": "Cereus lauterbachii, commonly known as the Lauterbach's cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and spines. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, a trait common among many cacti. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert conditions. Its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming make it a striking addition to botanical collections."
