    "intro": "Cornus spaethii, commonly known as the Sp\u00e4th's dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are typically red or purple in color. It prefers well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Cornus spaethii is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
