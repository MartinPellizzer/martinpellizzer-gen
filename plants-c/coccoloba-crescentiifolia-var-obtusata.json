    "intro": "Coccoloba crescentiifolia var. obtusata, commonly known as the broadleaf coccoloba, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it thrives in moist, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by distinctive, red, fleshy fruits. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage."
