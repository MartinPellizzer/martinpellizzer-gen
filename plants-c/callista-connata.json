    "intro": "Callista connata, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow inflorescences that resemble cascading raindrops, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The species is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for pollinators."
