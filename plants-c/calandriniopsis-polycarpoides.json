It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three petals and three sepals, typical of the Hydrocharitaceae family. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
