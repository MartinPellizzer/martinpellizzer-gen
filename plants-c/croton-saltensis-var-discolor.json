    "intro": "Croton saltensis var. discolor, commonly known as the Variegated Croton, is a striking tropical shrub native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, multicolored leaves that display shades of green, yellow, and white, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
