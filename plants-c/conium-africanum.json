    "intro": "Conium africanum, commonly known as African hemlock, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its seeds are small and hairy, and the plant is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a poisonous plant and should be handled with care."
