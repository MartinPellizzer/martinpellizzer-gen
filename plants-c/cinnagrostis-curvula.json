It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and typically grows in dry, rocky soils. The plant features upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in late summer. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open grasslands. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
