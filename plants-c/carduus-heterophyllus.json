    "intro": "Carduus heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its leaves are usually lobed and covered in dense, prickly hairs. The species is known for its variability in leaf shape and size, which contributes to its common name."
