It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, glossy foliage and striking white to greenish-white flowers. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties, as it is a source of quinine, a compound historically used to treat malaria. Its bark contains alkaloids that have been studied for their pharmacological applications. Cinchona viridiflora thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes."
