    "intro": "Caragana arborescens var. cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf shrub pea, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that give it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers in early summer, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. This species is often used for erosion control and as a windbreak due to its hardy nature."
