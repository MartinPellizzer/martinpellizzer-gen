    "intro": "Cubincola, commonly known as the Cuban orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to the island of Cuba. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually broad and glossy, adapted to capture limited sunlight. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cubincola is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
