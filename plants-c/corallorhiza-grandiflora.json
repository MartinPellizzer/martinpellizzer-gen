    "intro": "Corallorhiza grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered coralroot, is an orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrition. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with fungi, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to its reliance on specific fungal partners and habitat conditions, it is often considered a rare and endangered species."
