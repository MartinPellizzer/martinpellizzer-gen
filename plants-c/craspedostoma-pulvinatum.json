    "intro": "Craspedostoma pulvinatum, commonly known as the pulvinated craspedostoma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. Its leaves are often hairy and have a distinctive pulvinate (swollen) base, which is a key identifying feature. Craspedostoma pulvinatum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
