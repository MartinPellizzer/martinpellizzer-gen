    "intro": "Cyclosorus gongylodes var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy cyclosorus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that float on the water surface, with a short, rhizomatous stem. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in shallow, muddy habitats. Its hairy foliage helps it retain moisture and provides a unique texture among aquatic plants."
