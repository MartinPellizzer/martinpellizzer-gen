    "intro": "Crepidium apollinis, commonly known as the Apollo's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip that is often marked with intricate patterns. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
