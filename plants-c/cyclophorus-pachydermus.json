    "intro": "Cyclophorus pachydermus, commonly known as the thick-skinned cyclophorus, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is notable for its robust, thickened stems and leaves, which help it survive in arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a circular pattern, giving it its scientific name. Cyclophorus pachydermus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
