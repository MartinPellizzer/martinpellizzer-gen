    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 rubrum, commonly known as the red-flowered lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety red petals and a distinctive pouch-like lip that serves as a pollination trap. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments with rich, well-drained soil. It produces showy flowers in late spring to early summer, and its growth is often slow, requiring several years to reach maturity. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
