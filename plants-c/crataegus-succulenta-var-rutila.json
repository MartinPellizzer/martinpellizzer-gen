It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, yellowish-orange flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and seasonal color changes."
