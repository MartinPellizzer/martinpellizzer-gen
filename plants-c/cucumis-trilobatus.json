    "intro": "Cucumis trilobatus, commonly known as the three-lobed cucumber, is a species of flowering plant in the Cucurbitaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves and elongated, thin fruits. The plant typically grows as an annual vine, climbing using tendrils that emerge from the leaf axils. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces small, green, edible fruits that are often used in local cuisines. The botanical features of Cucumis trilobatus make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
