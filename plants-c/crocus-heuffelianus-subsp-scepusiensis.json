    "intro": "Crocus heuffelianus subsp. scepusiensis, commonly known as the Scepusian crocus, is a rare and ornamental bulbous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features delicate, early spring-blooming flowers with bright yellow petals and a prominent, often reddish or purple-colored style. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in woodland or alpine environments. Its bulbs are relatively small and are adapted to survive in cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
