    "intro": "Cyperus fluminalis var. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. This variety is native to wetland and marshy habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
