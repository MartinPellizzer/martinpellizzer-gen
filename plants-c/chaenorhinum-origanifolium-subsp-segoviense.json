    "intro": "Chaenorhinum origanifolium subsp. segoviense, commonly known as Segovian horned poppy, is a rare and endemic species native to southern Spain. It is characterized by its distinctive, spurred petals that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, calcareous soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its flowers are usually pink or red, and it blooms in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
