    "intro": "Colletoecema magna, commonly known as the giant marsh orchid, is a striking plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and requires a humid environment to flourish. Its leaves are long and narrow, adapted to filter water and absorb nutrients efficiently. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in several conservation areas."
