    "intro": "Calonemorchis bicalliata, commonly known as the two-spined calonemorchis, is a rare and unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive two-spined labellum, which sets it apart from other orchid species. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces a single, slender stem with few leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
