    "intro": "Cuscuta arvensis var. pentagona, commonly known as the five-angled dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is often found in agricultural fields and disturbed soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution. The five-angled structure of its fruits is a distinctive botanical feature that aids in seed dispersal."
