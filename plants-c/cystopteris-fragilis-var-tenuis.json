    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender brittle fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often described as appearing almost translucent. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its fragility and is often found in association with other ferns in rich, humid habitats."
