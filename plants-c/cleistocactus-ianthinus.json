    "intro": "Cleistocactus ianthinus, commonly known as the blue-tipped cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in white or grayish spines. The plant produces vibrant blue or violet flowers that bloom in the evening, a unique adaptation to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its compact size and striking appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Cleistocactus ianthinus is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
