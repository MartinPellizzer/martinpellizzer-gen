It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically a deep pink or red color. The plant has a tall, erect stem with few leaves and produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade and is often found in forest understories.
