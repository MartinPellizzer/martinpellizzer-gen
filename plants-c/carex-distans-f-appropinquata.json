It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its botanical features include narrow, linear leaves and small, three-lobed flowers arranged in a dense cluster.
