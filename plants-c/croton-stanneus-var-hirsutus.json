    "intro": "Croton stanneus var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by orange to red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
