    "intro": "Carex borneensis, commonly known as Bornean sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. The plant is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and forest understories. Carex borneensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystem."
