    "intro": "Cynosurus uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, inconspicuous flower per spikelet. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. Cynosurus uniflorus is often found in undisturbed habitats and is valued for its ecological role in supporting insect populations."
