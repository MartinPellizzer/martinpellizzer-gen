    "intro": "Cynodon coracanus, commonly known as the blackgrass or African carpet grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, pale green spikelets that are clustered at the nodes, and it is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Cynodon coracanus is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a common weed in agricultural and urban areas. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly and form extensive colonies."
