It features dense, compact growth with bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has hairy, aromatic leaves that are often mistaken for those of common calendula species. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
