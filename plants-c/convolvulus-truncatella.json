    "intro": "Convolvulus truncatella, commonly known as the Persian knotweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the bindweed family, Convolvulaceae. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, funnel-shaped flowers. The plant typically has hairy stems and leaves that are heart-shaped or truncate at the base. It produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the early spring. Native to southern Europe and western Asia, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
