    "intro": "Cicer trifoliolatum, commonly known as the three-leaf vetch, is a leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Cicer trifoliolatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
