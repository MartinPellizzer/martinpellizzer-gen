    "intro": "Carex aquatilis var. sitchensis, commonly known as the Sitka sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as stream banks, marshes, and forested wetlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. It is an important component of riparian ecosystems and provides habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
