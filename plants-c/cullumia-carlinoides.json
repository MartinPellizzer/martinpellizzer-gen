    "intro": "Cullumia carlinoides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that produces bright yellow flowers resembling those of the dandelion. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is adapted to survive in poor soils and can tolerate high temperatures and drought conditions. The flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in desert ecosystems."
