    "intro": "Cyperus lagorensis, commonly known as the African bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic habitats. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. Cyperus lagorensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in aquatic ecosystems."
