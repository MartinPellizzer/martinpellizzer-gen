    "intro": "Corydalis alpina, commonly known as the alpine corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Fumariaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, purple, or white. The plant grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, often at high elevations where it tolerates cold and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are usually unbranched and hairy. Corydalis alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms."
