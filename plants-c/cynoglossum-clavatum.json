    "intro": "Cynoglossum clavatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mouse-ear, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinctive heart-shaped base. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Cynoglossum clavatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
