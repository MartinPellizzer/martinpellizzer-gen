These plants are characterized by their vibrant, showy flowers and are often cultivated as ornamental plants. Caryolobium species typically have upright stems and broad, velvety leaves. The flowers are usually clustered in a compact inflorescence, often resembling a rosette. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
