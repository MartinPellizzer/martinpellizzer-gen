    "intro": "Cerastium refractum, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky slopes. Cerastium refractum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local insect populations."
