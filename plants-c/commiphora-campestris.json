It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap, which has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in panicles. The plant's resin, known as guggul, has been utilized in Ayurvedic medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and detoxifying effects."
