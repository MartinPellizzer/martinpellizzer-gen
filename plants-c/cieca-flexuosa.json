    "intro": "Cieca flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible cieca, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cieca flexuosa is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its growth habit is vine-like, with the ability to climb or trail along the ground, making it a versatile plant in both natural and cultivated settings."
