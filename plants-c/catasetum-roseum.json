It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers, which are often adorned with a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its inflorescence consists of a raceme of fragrant, showy blooms that attract specific pollinators. Catasetum roseum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light to thrive."
