It features tall, sparsely leafed stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often with a reddish hue. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in composite flower heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lanceolate, with rough, hairy surfaces and marginal teeth. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
