    "intro": "Cistanthe paniculata, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Cistanthe paniculata is often found in sandy soils and is a hardy species that thrives in low-nutrient conditions."
