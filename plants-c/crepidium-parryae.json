    "intro": "Crepidium parryae, commonly known as the Parry's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces a single, slender stem with a few leaves and bears a single, fragrant flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Crepidium parryae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
