    "intro": "Clybatis, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a member of the Poaceae family, although it is more closely related to the grass family than to true grasses. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered blue or violet flowers that resemble those of the true grasses. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Clybatis has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in temperate regions of North America. It plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
