    "intro": "Crataegus nitidula, commonly known as the smooth hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and thorny branches. The plant produces white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with finely toothed margins and a glossy upper surface. Crataegus nitidula is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
