    "intro": "Carduus clavatus, commonly known as the nodding thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in dry, disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with stiff hairs, while its flowers are arranged in a single head. Carduus clavatus is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas where it can spread through its extensive root system."
