    "intro": "Convolvulus pensylvanicus, commonly known as Pennsylvania morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves and twining stems that climb or trail along the ground. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and shaded areas."
