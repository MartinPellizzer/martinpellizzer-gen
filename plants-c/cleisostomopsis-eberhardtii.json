    "intro": "Cleisostomopsis eberhardtii, commonly known as the Eberhardt's cleisostomopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
