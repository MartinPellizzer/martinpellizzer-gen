    "intro": "Carex arenaria var. pseudobrizoides, commonly known as the sand sedge, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. This plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or rocky habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it an important component of desert ecosystems."
