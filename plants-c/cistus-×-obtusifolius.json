It features gray-green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy clusters of pink or white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. Cistus \u00d7 obtusifolius is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
