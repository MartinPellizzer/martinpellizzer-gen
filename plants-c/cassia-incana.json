    "intro": "Cassia incana, commonly known as silver cassia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray, papery bark and pinnate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow-orange inflorescences that are clustered in cylindrical spikes, which bloom during the summer months. Cassia incana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
