    "intro": "Combretum leprosum, commonly known as the sour fig or red bush willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-white flowers followed by small, fleshy, orange-red fruits that are edible. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including savannas and rocky areas, and is adapted to seasonal droughts. Combretum leprosum is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
