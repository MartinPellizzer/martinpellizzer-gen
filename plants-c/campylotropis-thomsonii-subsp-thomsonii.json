    "intro": "Campylotropis thomsonii subsp. thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's false indigo, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its clusters of small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for native plant gardens. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
