    "intro": "Crataegus aurescens, commonly known as the golden hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its showy, yellowish-orange flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It typically grows in woodland edges, thickets, and moist soils, reaching heights of up to 10 feet. The leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn vibrant red in the autumn, adding to its ornamental value."
