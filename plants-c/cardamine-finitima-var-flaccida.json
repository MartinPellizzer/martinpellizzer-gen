    "intro": "Cardamine finitima var. flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid water crowfoot, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Europe. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and ponds. The plant features delicate, floating leaves that are usually pale green with a waxy surface. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
