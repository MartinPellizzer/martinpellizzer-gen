    "intro": "Codariocalyx motorius var. roylei, commonly known as the sensitive plant or Mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its rapid leaf movement has made it a subject of interest in botanical and physiological studies."
