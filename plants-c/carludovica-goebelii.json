Native to the cloud forests of Mexico, it is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces toxic berries that contain tropane alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
