These plants are characterized by their showy, often pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. They typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and are native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Cercanthemum species are often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
