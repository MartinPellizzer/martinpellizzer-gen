    "intro": "Cyathea corcovadensis, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with a short rhizome that supports the trunk and produces new fronds from the top. Its fronds can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, contributing to its striking appearance in natural habitats. Cyathea corcovadensis plays an important ecological role in tropical forests, providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity."
