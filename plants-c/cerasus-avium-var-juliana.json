    "intro": "Cerasus avium var. juliana, commonly known as the Japanese cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but typically not cultivated for consumption. Its ornamental value lies in its beautiful blossoms and graceful form, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. The leaves are simple, alternate, and turn vibrant shades of red in autumn, adding to its seasonal appeal."
