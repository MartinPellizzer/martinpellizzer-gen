    "intro": "Claytonia cupulata, commonly known as the \"spring beauty,\" is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Portulacaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a low, mat-like growth habit. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Claytonia cupulata is often found in rich, loamy soils and is a popular plant among gardeners for its ornamental value."
