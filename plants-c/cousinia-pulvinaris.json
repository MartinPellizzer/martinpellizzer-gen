    "intro": "Cousinia pulvinaris, commonly known as the cushion cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of silver-gray leaves that form a compact cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences at the center of the plant. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Cousinia pulvinaris is often used in rock gardens and alpine plantings due to its hardiness and ornamental appearance."
