    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. spicata, commonly known as the spiky coconut palm, is a variant of the coconut tree characterized by its distinctive, sharp, spiny fronds. This variety is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces coconuts that are typically smaller and more compact compared to the standard coconut variety. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in landscaping. The spicata variant is also valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand coastal conditions."
