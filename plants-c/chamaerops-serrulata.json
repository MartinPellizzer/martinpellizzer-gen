    "intro": "Chamaerops serrulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fan palm, is a species native to the Canary Islands. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stiff, fan-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, black, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
