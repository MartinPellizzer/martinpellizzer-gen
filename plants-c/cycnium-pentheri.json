    "intro": "Cycnium pentheri, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, white to purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and stems adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Cycnium pentheri plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various desert wildlife."
