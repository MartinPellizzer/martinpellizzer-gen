    "intro": "Chaenorhinum origanifolium subsp. bourgaei, commonly known as the narrowleaf flaxflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of oregano. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
