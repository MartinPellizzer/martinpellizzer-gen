    "intro": "Cyclogramma simulans, commonly known as the false prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial plant characterized by its spiny, paddle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, edible fruits. Cyclogramma simulans has a shallow root system that helps it absorb moisture from the soil efficiently. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for desert conditions and minimal water availability."
