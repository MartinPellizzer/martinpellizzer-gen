    "intro": "Codiaeum variegatum f. medium, commonly known as the \"Marble Queen\" or \"Variegated Croton,\" is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that display a striking combination of creamy white, yellow, and green hues. The plant is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is typically grown as a houseplant due to its sensitivity to cold temperatures. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its vibrant foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and decorative purposes."
