    "intro": "Centotheca lappacea var. longilamina, commonly known as the long-leaf centotheca, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, typical of many sedges. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands or forest floors. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
