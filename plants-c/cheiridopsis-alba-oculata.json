    "intro": "Cheiridopsis alba-oculata, commonly known as the white-eyed ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a powdery coating on its leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Cheiridopsis alba-oculata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
