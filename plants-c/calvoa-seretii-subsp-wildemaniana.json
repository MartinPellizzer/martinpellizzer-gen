    "intro": "Calvoa seretii subsp. wildemaniana, commonly known as the Wildeman's calvoa, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and leaf morphology. The subspecies is distinguished by its small, hairy leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
