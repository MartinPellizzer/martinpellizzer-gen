    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 aphrodite, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens. It is characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white with a yellowish throat. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and dark green, and it produces a single flower stem with several blooms. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it is also considered a rare and protected species in the wild."
