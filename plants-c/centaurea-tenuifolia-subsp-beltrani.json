    "intro": "Centaurea tenuifolia subsp. beltrani, commonly known as the narrow-leaved centaury, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and produces bright blue to purple flowers in summer. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-gray hue due to dense pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This subspecies is closely related to other centaurea species but is distinguished by its smaller size and specific floral characteristics."
