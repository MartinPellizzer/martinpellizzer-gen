    "intro": "Campanula orbelica, commonly known as the bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers, which range in color from blue to purple, and are typically 2 to 4 inches in diameter. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces slender, branching stems that rise above the foliage. Campanula orbelica thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
