    "intro": "Cattleya sessilis, commonly known as the lowland cattleya, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves and large, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Cattleya sessilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
