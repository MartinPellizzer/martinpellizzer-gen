    "intro": "Clematis dubia, commonly known as the yellow clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are twining and can grow up to 20 feet long, making it an excellent choice for trellises or pergolas. Clematis dubia prefers partial shade and well-drained soil, and it is relatively hardy in USDA zones 4 to 8."
