    "intro": "Carex megacarpa, commonly known as the giant marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces large, showy, spike-like inflorescences that are typically reddish-brown in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Carex megacarpa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
