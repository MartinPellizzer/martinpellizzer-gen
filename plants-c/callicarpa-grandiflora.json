It is characterized by its clusters of small, violet-blue berries that appear in the fall, which are a key feature of the plant. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, turning red in the autumn. The plant produces fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are borne in clusters. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
