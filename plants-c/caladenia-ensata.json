    "intro": "Caladenia ensata, commonly known as the narrow-lipped spider-orchid, is an orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, intricately patterned flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically blooms during the spring and early summer, producing flowers in shades of yellow, green, and brown. Caladenia ensata thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. Its floral structure is highly specialized, with a single lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators."
