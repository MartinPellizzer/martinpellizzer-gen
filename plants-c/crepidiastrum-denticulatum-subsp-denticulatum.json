    "intro": "Crepidiastrum denticulatum subsp. denticulatum, commonly known as the serrated sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil conditions. Its succulent leaves help store water, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
