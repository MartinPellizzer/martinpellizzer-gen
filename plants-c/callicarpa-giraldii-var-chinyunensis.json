    "intro": "Callicarpa giraldii var. chinyunensis, commonly known as the Chinyun Beauty or Chinese beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It belongs to the honeysuckle family (Caprifoliaceae) and is characterized by its clusters of vibrant purple to red berries that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges.
