It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered umbels of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, oval fruits that are often used in traditional herbal medicine.
