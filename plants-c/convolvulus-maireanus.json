    "intro": "Convolvulus maireanus, commonly known as Maire's bindweed, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a perennial vine characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and wetlands. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain environments."
