It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa. This plant is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of dust or hair. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Cheilanthes cuneata is often found growing on rock faces or in crevices, where it can access limited moisture and nutrients."
