    "intro": "Campanula mollis var. mesatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States. It features upright stems covered in fine, silver-gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval and slightly hairy, often with a waxy coating to withstand maritime conditions. This variety is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal meadows."
