    "intro": "Carex chionophila, commonly known as the snow-haired sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its silvery-white appearance, which is due to the dense covering of fine hairs on its leaves."
