    "intro": "Cestrum organense, commonly known as the yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds. Cestrum organense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
