    "intro": "Chrysophyllum lucumifolium, commonly known as the golden leaf chrysophyllum, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that range in color from deep green to a striking golden hue, depending on light exposure. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, citrus-like fruits with a sweet and tangy flavor. It thrives in humid, well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruit, it is often cultivated in gardens and agroforestry systems."
