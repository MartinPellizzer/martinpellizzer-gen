It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated stems and yellowish-green foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in cyathia, typical of the spurge family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxic sap, it is important to handle the plant with care."
