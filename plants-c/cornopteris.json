    "intro": "Cornopteris, commonly known as the rock brake fern, is a genus of evergreen ferns native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It typically grows in rocky, shaded environments, often on cliffs or among boulders. The plant has a robust rhizome system that helps it anchor in crevices and absorb moisture from the air. Its fronds are usually leathery and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. Cornopteris species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens with moist, acidic soil."
