    "intro": "Campanula kastellorizana, commonly known as the Kastellorizan bellflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the Greek island of Kastellorizo. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal areas and thrives in well-drained soils. It has narrow, linear leaves and is adapted to the harsh, maritime climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
