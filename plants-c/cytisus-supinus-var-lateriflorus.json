It is characterized by its dense, prostrate growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features small, oval leaves with a hairy texture and produces legume pods that contain seeds. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
