    "intro": "Caralluma praegracilis, commonly known as the slender devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Australia. It features a branched stem with spines and small, fleshy leaves that help it store water. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its desert habitat. Its adaptations to drought and high temperatures make it well-suited for xerophytic environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
