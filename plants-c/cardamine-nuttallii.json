    "intro": "Cardamine nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a delicate, fern-like appearance, and small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous, and it produces small, elongated seed pods that release minute seeds. Nuttall's watercress is often found in temperate regions of North America, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
