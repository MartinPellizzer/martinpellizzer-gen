    "intro": "Cotoneaster cambricus, commonly known as the Welsh cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to western Europe. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and has dark green, elliptical leaves that turn red in the autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for hedging or ornamental planting. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
