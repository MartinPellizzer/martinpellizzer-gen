    "intro": "Cephalanthera damasonium subsp. caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and a long, spiraled inflorescence of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant is mycoheterotrophic, meaning it relies on fungal associations for its nutrition rather than photosynthesis. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
