    "intro": "Cladomischus, commonly known as the desert rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Cladomischus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
