    "intro": "Clidemia piperifolia, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it typically grows in moist, shaded habitats. It plays an important ecological role in Hawaiian ecosystems, providing nectar for native pollinators. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
