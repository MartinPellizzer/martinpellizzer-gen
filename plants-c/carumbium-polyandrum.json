    "intro": "Carumbium polyandrum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain numerous tiny seeds. Carumbium polyandrum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
