    "intro": "Carex stellulata var. masculina, commonly known as the male sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments, such as marshes or along stream banks. It produces wind-pollinated flowers, which are usually inconspicuous and lack showy petals. This variety is distinguished from its counterpart, var. stellulata, by its male reproductive structures and slightly different morphology."
