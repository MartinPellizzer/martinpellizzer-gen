    "intro": "Carex dianae var. aequabilis, commonly known as the smooth marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense clumps that help stabilize shoreline areas. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is distinguished by its uniform, smooth leaf surfaces and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and aesthetic value."
