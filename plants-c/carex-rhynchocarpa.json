    "intro": "Carex rhynchocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruit sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Carex rhynchocarpa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
