    "intro": "Coelogyne vernicosa, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green flowers, which bloom during the rainy season. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Coelogyne vernicosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant and long-lasting blooms."
