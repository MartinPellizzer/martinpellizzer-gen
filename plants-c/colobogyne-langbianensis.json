    "intro": "Colobogyne langbianensis, commonly known as the Langbian mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of Vietnam. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in dense forest undergrowth. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying biodiversity in Southeast Asia. Conservation efforts are crucial due to habitat loss and its vulnerability to environmental changes."
