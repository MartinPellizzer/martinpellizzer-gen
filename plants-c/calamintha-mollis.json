    "intro": "Calamintha mollis, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, sweetly aromatic scent, which is attributed to its volatile oils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Calamintha mollis is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine."
