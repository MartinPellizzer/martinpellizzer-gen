    "intro": "Coursetia tumbezensis, commonly known as the Tumbes coursetia, is a species of flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northern South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Coursetia tumbezensis is valued for its ornamental potential and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a similar climate."
