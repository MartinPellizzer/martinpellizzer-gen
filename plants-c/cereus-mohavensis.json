    "intro": "Cereus mohavensis, commonly known as the Mohave candleplant, is a flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can reach up to 6 feet in height, covered in white, waxy spines. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a strong, sweet fragrance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering habit, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
