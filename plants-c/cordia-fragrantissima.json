    "intro": "Cordia fragrantissima, commonly known as the fragrant cordia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Caribbean. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains several seeds, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
