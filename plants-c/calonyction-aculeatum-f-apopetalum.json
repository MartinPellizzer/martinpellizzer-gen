    "intro": "Calonyction aculeatum f. apopetalum, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a variant of the woolly thistle with distinctive botanical features. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and large, violet-blue flower heads. The plant's leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its fuzzy appearance. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually surrounded by bracts, and it is often found in dry, rocky soils. This form is notable for its unique floral structure, which differs slightly from the typical species."
