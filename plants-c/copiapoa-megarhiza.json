    "intro": "Copiapoa megarhiza, commonly known as the giant copiapoa, is a cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant has a sparsely branched structure with ribbed stems and spines that provide protection from herbivores. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming during the cooler months. Copiapoa megarhiza is well adapted to arid conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
