    "intro": "Cyrtandra martini, commonly known as the Hawaiian cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the island of Moloka\u02bbi in Hawaii. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant is an herbaceous perennial with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Cyrtandra martini is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
