    "intro": "Conostylis pauciflora subsp. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered conostylis, is a low-growing, perennial herb native to southeastern Australia. It typically features a basal rosette of narrow, grey-green leaves and produces small, pale blue or white flowers in late summer. The plant is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. It has a compact growth habit and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
