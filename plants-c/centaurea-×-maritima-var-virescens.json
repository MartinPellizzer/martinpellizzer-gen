    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 maritima var. virescens, commonly known as the green sea centaury, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal areas of southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue to purple flower heads, which are composed of numerous small, tubular florets. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that contributes to its common name. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal environments."
