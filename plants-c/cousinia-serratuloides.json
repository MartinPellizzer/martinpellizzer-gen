    "intro": "Cousinia serratuloides, commonly known as the serrated globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Cousinia serratuloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
