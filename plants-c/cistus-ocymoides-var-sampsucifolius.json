It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves that emit a strong, lemony scent when crushed. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is dense and evergreen, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils."
