It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by bright orange-red berries in late summer. The plant has slender, twining stems that can climb or trail, making it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. Its foliage is dark green and often has a slightly hairy texture. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, thriving in cooler climates."
