    "intro": "Cerasus japonica var. glandulosa, commonly known as the Japanese cherry with glandular hairs, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it its botanical variant name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, typically pink or white, followed by edible, sweet cherries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both horticultural and ecological studies."
