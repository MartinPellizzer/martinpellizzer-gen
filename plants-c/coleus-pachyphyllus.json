It is characterized by its vibrant, variegated leaves that display shades of red, green, and white, often with a waxy texture. The plant belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like mint and basil. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, a feature that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.
