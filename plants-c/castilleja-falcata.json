    "intro": "Castilleja falcata, commonly known as the hookleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Castilleja falcata plays an important role in pollination and is often found growing alongside other native flora."
