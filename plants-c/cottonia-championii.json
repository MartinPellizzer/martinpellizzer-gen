    "intro": "Cottonia championii, commonly known as the desert cotton or desert cottonweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that produces small, fluffy white flowers resembling cotton, which give it its common name. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Cottonia championii plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
