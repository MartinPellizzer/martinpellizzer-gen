It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like clusters of inconspicuous flowers. Its foliage is characterized by dark green, hairy leaves that give it its common name. Cinnagrostis fuscata plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
