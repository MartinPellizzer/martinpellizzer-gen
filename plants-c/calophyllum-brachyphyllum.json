    "intro": "Calophyllum brachyphyllum, commonly known as the short-leaf calophyllum, is a tropical tree native to regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, often glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, orange-red fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
