    "intro": "Cipuropsis bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored cipuropsis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking bi-colored flowers, which typically display a combination of white and purple hues. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
