    "intro": "Columbia longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled columbia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated petioles that can reach several inches in length. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a delicate, feathery appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
