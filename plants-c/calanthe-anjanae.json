    "intro": "Calanthe anjanae, commonly known as the Anjana's calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and strikingly beautiful, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its flowers are borne on tall, erect stems and are notable for their intricate, spurred petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calanthe anjanae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
