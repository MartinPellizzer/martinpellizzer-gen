    "intro": "Crepis cichoroides, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a compact inflorescence. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. The plant is notable for its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. Its morphology and growth habits make it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings."
