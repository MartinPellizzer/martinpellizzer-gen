    "intro": "Cyrtochilum umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety leaves that help it absorb and retain moisture in shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and purple, which bloom during the dry season. Cyrtochilum umbrosum is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
