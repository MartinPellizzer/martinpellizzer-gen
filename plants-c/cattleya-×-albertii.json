    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 albertii, commonly known as the Albert's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically display vibrant shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Cattleya \u00d7 albertii is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
