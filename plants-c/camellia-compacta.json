    "intro": "Camellia compacta, commonly known as the dwarf camellia, is a species of evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showsy, camellia-like flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. Camellia compacta thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce fragrant, pink to red flowers throughout the winter months."
