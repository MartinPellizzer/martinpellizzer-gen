    "intro": "Cymbostemon, commonly known as the desert verbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Verbenaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their aromatic, often gray-green foliage. Cymbostemon species produce showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple, often blooming in summer. They are adapted to arid environments and are drought-tolerant, making them suitable for xeriscaping."
