    "intro": "Clermontia coerulea var. degeneri, commonly known as the Hawaiian bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hawaii. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often found in the understory of native Hawaiian forests. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, this rare plant is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
