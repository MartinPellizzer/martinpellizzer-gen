    "intro": "Conostegia henripittieri, commonly known as the Henry Pittier's conostegia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Cuba and the Isle of Pines. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its botanical features include glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, contributing to its ecological interactions in its native habitat. Conostegia henripittieri is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
