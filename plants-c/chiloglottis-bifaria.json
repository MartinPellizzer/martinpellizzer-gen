    "intro": "Chiloglottis bifaria, commonly known as the black leaching orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dark purple to blackish flowers and its preference for moist, shaded habitats. The plant typically grows in heathlands and forests, often near streams or in swampy areas. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Chiloglottis bifaria is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic."
