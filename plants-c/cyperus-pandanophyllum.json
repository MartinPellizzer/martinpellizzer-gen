    "intro": "Cyperus pandanophyllum, commonly known as the pandan-flowered flatsedge, is a species of sedge native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that resemble pandan leaves in appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
