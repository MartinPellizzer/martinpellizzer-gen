    "intro": "Cardamine astoniae, commonly known as the Scottish watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Scottish Highlands and parts of northern England. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in damp woodlands. The plant has delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous, and it spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies. It is valued for its peppery flavor and has been traditionally used in local cuisine and herbal remedies."
