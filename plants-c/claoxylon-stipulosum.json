    "intro": "Claoxylon stipulosum, commonly known as the slender-stipule claoxylon, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with small stipules. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It typically grows in lowland rainforests and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
