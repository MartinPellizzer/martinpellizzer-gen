    "intro": "Cymbopogon marginatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences and is known for its strong citrus scent, which comes from volatile oils in its leaves. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. Its botanical features make it a valuable species in both ecological and commercial contexts."
