    "intro": "Cleome filisepala, commonly known as the thread-sepaled cleome, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Cleomaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cleome filisepala is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in warm, sunny conditions. It prefers well-drained soil and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
