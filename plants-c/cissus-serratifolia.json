    "intro": "Cissus serratifolia, commonly known as the rock fig or sandstone vine, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped, glossy leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light. Cissus serratifolia is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and ability to grow on rocky surfaces."
