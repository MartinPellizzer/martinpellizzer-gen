    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris subf. conica, commonly known as the conical heather, is a subshrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, conical growth habit and dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing pink or purple flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
