    "intro": "Calamagrostis arundinacea var. densa, commonly known as dense reed grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It features tall, upright culms with narrow, dark green leaves that are slightly hairy along the edges. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy florets that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshes. Dense reed grass is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
