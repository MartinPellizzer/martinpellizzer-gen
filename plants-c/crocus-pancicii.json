    "intro": "Crocus pancicii, commonly known as the Pancic's crocus, is a rare and striking species native to the alpine regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its vivid violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow center, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and high-altitude meadows, preferring cool and moist conditions. Its bulbs are covered in a protective tunic and are adapted to survive harsh winter climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
