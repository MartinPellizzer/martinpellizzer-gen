    "intro": "Cronquistianthus niveus, commonly known as the snow-lit evergreen, is a rare shrub native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white foliage, which reflects sunlight and gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers during the late spring and early summer. Its leaves are leathery and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Cronquistianthus niveus is primarily found in rocky crevices and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils."
