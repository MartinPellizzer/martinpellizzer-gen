    "intro": "Cotoneaster acutifolius f. glabriusculus, commonly known as the smooth-leaved cotoneaster, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, oval, dark green leaves that are smooth and slightly leathery, distinguishing it from other cotoneaster species. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a hedge. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens for its year-round interest."
