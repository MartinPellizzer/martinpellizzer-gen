    "intro": "Chamaecyparis pisifera f. filifera-aurea, commonly known as the golden Japanese cedar, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen conifer with a distinctive pyramidal shape. Its foliage consists of small, scale-like leaves that are a vibrant golden-yellow, providing a striking visual contrast to its dark green branches. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that are typically inconspicuous, with the cones maturing to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and its ability to maintain a neat, compact form with minimal pruning."
