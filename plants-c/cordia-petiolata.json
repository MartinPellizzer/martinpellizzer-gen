    "intro": "Cordia petiolata, commonly known as the red mangrove or mangrove apple, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and small, fleshy red fruits that contain several seeds. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often growing in coastal areas and mangrove swamps. Its roots form a complex network that helps stabilize shorelines and filter water. Cordia petiolata plays an important ecological role in supporting marine and terrestrial life in its habitat."
