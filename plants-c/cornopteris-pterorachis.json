    "intro": "Cornopteris pterorachis, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a finely divided, feathery appearance. Cornopteris pterorachis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
