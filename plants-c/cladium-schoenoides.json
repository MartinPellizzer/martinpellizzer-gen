    "intro": "Cladium schoenoides, commonly known as the marsh sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with a fibrous, rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in late summer, which are pollinated by wind. Its leaves are often used in traditional basket-making and as thatching material due to their durability. Cladium schoenoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
