It features narrow, gray-green leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs along its stems. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, blue-violet flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Caryopteris trichosphaera is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
