    "intro": "Caladenia rhomboidiformis, commonly known as the Rhomboid Spider-orchid, is an orchid species native to western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in heathland and sandplain environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs during late winter to early spring, and it is pollinated primarily by thynnid wasps. Caladenia rhomboidiformis is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
