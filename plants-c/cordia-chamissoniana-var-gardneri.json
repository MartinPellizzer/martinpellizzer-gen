    "intro": "Cordia chamissoniana var. gardneri, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are succulent and adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. This species is well-suited to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
