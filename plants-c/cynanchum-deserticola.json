    "intro": "Cynanchum deserticola, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh desert conditions, featuring deep root systems and thick, fleshy leaves to conserve water. Its latex-like sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Cynanchum deserticola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
