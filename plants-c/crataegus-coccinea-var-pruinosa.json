    "intro": "Crataegus coccinea var. pruinosa, commonly known as the purpleflowered hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges, and the bark is often fissured with a reddish-brown color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
