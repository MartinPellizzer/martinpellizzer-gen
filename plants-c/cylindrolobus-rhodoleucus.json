    "intro": "Cylindrolobus rhodoleucus, commonly known as the red-stemmed ironwood, is a rare and distinctive member of the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its native arid or semi-arid environments. The species is native to southern Africa and is often found in rocky or sandy soils, where it forms a dense, shrub-like growth habit."
