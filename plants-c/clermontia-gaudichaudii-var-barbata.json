    "intro": "Clermontia gaudichaudii var. barbata, commonly known as the Hawaiian cliff hanger, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in coastal habitats, often on rocky cliffs or slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually bright red or orange, with a distinctive, elongated shape that resembles a torch. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, this variety is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
