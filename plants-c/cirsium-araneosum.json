It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Cirsium araneosum is often found in meadows, wastelands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in disturbed environments."
