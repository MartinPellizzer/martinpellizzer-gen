    "intro": "Calamagrostis sedenensis, commonly known as the Sedenense reed, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of southern Europe. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, riverbanks, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, silver-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Calamagrostis sedenensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
