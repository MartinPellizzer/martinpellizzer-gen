    "intro": "Cardiospermum loureiroi, commonly known as the heartleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release seeds with tufted hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas or along forest edges. Botanically, it belongs to the family Convolvulaceae, which includes many species of morning glories."
