    "intro": "Cousinia resupinata, commonly known as the prostrate globemallow, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of silver-green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Cousinia resupinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
