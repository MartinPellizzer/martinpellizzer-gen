    "intro": "Chamaerops humilis variegata, commonly known as the variegated windmill palm, is a compact, cold-hardy palm native to southern Europe. It features a slender trunk with a crown of feather-like leaves that display striking variegation of green, white, and yellow. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its slow growth rate and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for small spaces. It is also valued for its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and urban environments."
