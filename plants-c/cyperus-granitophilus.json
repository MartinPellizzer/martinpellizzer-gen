    "intro": "Cyperus granitophilus, commonly known as the granite sedge, is a perennial herb native to arid and rocky environments in southern Africa. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and compact, rosette-forming growth habit, which helps it conserve water in its harsh habitat. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and establish itself in crevices and shallow soils. Cyperus granitophilus is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun, making it a resilient species in extreme environments."
