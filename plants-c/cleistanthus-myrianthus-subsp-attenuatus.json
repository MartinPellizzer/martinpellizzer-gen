    "intro": "Cleistanthus myrianthus subsp. attenuatus, commonly known as the slender cleistanthus, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warmer climates."
