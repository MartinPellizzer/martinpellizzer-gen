    "intro": "Cissampelos peltata, commonly known as the broad-leafed moon vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces distinctive, fleshy, orange-red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its stems are woody and can climb by means of tendrils, making it a common sight in humid, shaded environments. The botanical features of Cissampelos peltata make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitats."
