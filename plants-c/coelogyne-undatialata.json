    "intro": "Coelogyne undatialata, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant features a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting it to its tropical environment. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, typically arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Coelogyne undatialata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
