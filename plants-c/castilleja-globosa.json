    "intro": "Castilleja globosa, commonly known as the globeflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small and opposite, and it typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native range."
