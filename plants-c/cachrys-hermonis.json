    "intro": "Cachrys hermonis, commonly known as the Hermon's cushion plant, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure, which helps it conserve moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, sunny conditions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in alpine ecosystems."
