    "intro": "Carpobrotus vanzijliae, commonly known as the Atlantic coast fig, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Following flowering, it develops bright red, edible fruits that are rich in nutrients. Its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
