    "intro": "Carduus furiosus, commonly known as the mad thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant is also known for its ability to thrive in harsh environments, making it a resilient species in its native range."
