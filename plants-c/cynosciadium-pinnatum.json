    "intro": "Cynosciadium pinnatum, commonly known as the broadleaf hemlock, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
