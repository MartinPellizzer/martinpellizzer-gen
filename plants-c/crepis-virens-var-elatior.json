    "intro": "Crepis virens var. elatior, commonly known as the tall oatgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in open, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control."
