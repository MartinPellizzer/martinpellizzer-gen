    "intro": "Crataegus pelacris, commonly known as the thorny crabapple, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, often found in woodland edges and rocky soils. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer. Its thorny branches and compact growth habit make it a distinctive shrub in its native habitat. The botanical features of Crataegus pelacris contribute to its ecological role as a food source for wildlife and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
