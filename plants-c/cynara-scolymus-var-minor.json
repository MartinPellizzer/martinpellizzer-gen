    "intro": "Cynara scolymus var. minor, commonly known as the small globe artichoke, is a cultivated variant of the artichoke plant. It is characterized by its compact, globe-shaped inflorescence, which is typically smaller than that of the standard artichoke. The plant produces edible leaves and a tender, fleshy heart that is harvested before the flowers open. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun. This variety is prized for its mild flavor and is often used in both culinary and ornamental applications."
