    "intro": "Convolvulus arvensis f. cordifolius, commonly known as the heart-leaved field bindweed, is a variant of the annual field bindweed characterized by its heart-shaped leaves. This plant is a member of the Convolvulaceae family and is known for its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to\u6500\u63f4 on various structures. Its flowers are typically pale purple to white, with five petals and a distinctive spurred shape. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in cultivated areas."
