    "intro": "Cotyledon affinis, commonly known as the \"Chicken's Meat\" plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are usually green with red or purple veins, and it produces striking yellow flowers in summer. The plant is known for its ability to store water in its leaves, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, and its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
