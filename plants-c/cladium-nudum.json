    "intro": "Cladium nudum, commonly known as the slender spikerush, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, which are typically arranged at the top of the stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen, and it thrives in marshy or aquatic environments. Cladium nudum plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
