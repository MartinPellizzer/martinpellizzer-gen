It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in montane forests. Cyphochilus collinus is a terrestrial orchid with a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
