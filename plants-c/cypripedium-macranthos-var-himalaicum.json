    "intro": "Cypripedium macranthos var. himalaicum, commonly known as the Himalayan lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or purple flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination trap. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single upright stem with a few lateral branches. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this species is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
