    "intro": "Cereus pentlandii var. aurantiacominiatus, commonly known as the Orange Blossom Cereus, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color, which bloom at night. These flowers are followed by small, red fruits that contain edible seeds. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments."
