    "intro": "Curcuma pierreana, commonly known as the Pierre's turmeric, is a rhizomatous perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its ornamental leaves that are broad, lance-shaped, and often variegated with yellow and green. The plant produces spikes of fragrant, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. Its rhizomes, while not as widely used in cooking as other curcuma species, have been explored for their potential medicinal properties. Curcuma pierreana is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and as a decorative plant."
