    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia var. bocconei, commonly known as the Boccone's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Alps. It is characterized by its rounded, broad leaves and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The variety is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and flower size compared to the typical form of Campanula rotundifolia."
