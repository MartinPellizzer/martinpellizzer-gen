    "intro": "Cenchrus somalensis, commonly known as the Somali grass, is a perennial grass native to the Horn of Africa. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes. Its ecological importance is significant in regions where vegetation is sparse."
