    "intro": "Carex buxbaumii subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. This subspecies typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences are typical of the genus Carex. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
