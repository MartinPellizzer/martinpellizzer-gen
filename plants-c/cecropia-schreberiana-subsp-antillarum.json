    "intro": "Cecropia schreberiana subsp. antillarum, commonly known as the Antillean ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant has a distinctive trunk with a smooth, often swollen base, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in disturbed soils and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
