    "intro": "Cerastium dentatum, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear or mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Cerastium dentatum is often found in temperate regions and is known for its ability to spread through stolons, forming dense mats."
