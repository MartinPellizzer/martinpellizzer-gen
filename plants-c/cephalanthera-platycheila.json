    "intro": "Cephalanthera platycheila, commonly known as the broad-leafed lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the forests of eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a rhizomatous root system and lacks true leaves, instead having leaf-like structures called phylloclades. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands with rich, organic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
