    "intro": "Cestrum diversifolium, commonly known as the variable-leaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically at night. The plant has opposite, simple, and often lobed leaves that vary in shape, giving it its common name. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, with smooth, greyish bark. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, toxic seeds."
