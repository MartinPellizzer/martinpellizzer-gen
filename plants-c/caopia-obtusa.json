    "intro": "Caopia obtusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved caopia, is a perennial herb native to the grasslands of southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching towards the upper part. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, pale yellow flowers are clustered in loose panicles, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. The plant is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in well-drained soils."
