    "intro": "Carex vesicaria var. dichroa, commonly known as the two-colored sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green on top and lighter green underneath, giving it its characteristic dichroic appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, three-ranked flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wetland conditions."
