    "intro": "Cylindrolobus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid thornbush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means, aiding in its dispersal."
