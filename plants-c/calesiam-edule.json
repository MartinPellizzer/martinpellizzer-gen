    "intro": "Calesiam edule, commonly known as the edible cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its seeds are encased in a thick, fibrous sarcocarp, which is typically consumed after soaking to remove toxins. Calesiam edule is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and is valued for its nutritional content and cultural significance."
