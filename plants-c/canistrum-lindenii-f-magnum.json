    "intro": "Canistrum lindenii f. magnum, commonly known as the giant poinsettia, is a unique variant of the poinsettia species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its exceptionally large, vibrant red bracts that resemble the petals of a flower, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers during its blooming season. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This cultivar is popular for its striking appearance and is often used in ornamental gardening."
