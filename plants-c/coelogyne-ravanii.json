    "intro": "Coelogyne ravanii, commonly known as the Red Orchid, is a striking orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces pendulous racemes of fragrant, showy blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a thick, fibrous sheath, which helps store water and nutrients. Coelogyne ravanii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
