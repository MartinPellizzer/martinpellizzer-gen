It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. Native to South America, covolia thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Its ornamental value is often balanced by its cautionary presence in gardens."
