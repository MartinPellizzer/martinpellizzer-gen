    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum f. scabrella, commonly known as the rough dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant's surface is covered with a rough, scabrous texture, which is characteristic of this particular form. It typically parasitizes a variety of herbaceous plants, including those in the families Asteraceae and Fabaceae. Despite its lack of photosynthetic ability, it can thrive in a wide range of environments where suitable hosts are present."
