    "intro": "Ceratiola, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune ecosystems and along shorelines. Its adaptability to coastal environments makes it an important species in stabilizing dune systems. Ceratiola is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
