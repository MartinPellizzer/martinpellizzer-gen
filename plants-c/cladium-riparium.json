    "intro": "Cladium riparium, commonly known as the marsh cordgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds, lakes, and rivers, where it thrives in moist to submerged soil conditions. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into three-lobed fruits. Cladium riparium plays an important role in stabilizing shoreline soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels makes it a key component of riparian and wetland ecosystems."
