    "intro": "Chloris accumbens, commonly known as the prostrate grass or carpetgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Australia. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length and often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a ground cover in landscaping."
