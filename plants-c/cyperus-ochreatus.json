    "intro": "Cyperus ochreatus, commonly known as the yellow papyrus or swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters. Cyperus ochreatus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Its ecological importance lies in providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
