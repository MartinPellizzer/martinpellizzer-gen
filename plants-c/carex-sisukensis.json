    "intro": "Carex sisukensis, commonly known as the Sisuk Valley sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested or alpine environments. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex sisukensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
