It is characterized by its aromatic bark, which is used to produce a spice similar to true cinnamon. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into oval, woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a smooth, glossy surface. This variety is valued for its essential oils and is often cultivated for both ornamental and aromatic purposes."
