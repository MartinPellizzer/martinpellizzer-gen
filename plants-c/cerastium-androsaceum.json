    "intro": "Cerastium androsaceum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it withstand harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high elevations. Cerastium androsaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
