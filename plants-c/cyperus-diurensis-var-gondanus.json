    "intro": "Cyperus diurensis var. gondanus, commonly known as the Gondan's flatsedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like appearance with slender, often hairy stems. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and shallow water bodies, where it thrives in moist to submerged conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and morphological traits that set it apart from other Cyperus species."
