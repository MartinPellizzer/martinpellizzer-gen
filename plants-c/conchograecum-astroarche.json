    "intro": "Conchograecum astroarche, commonly known as the celestial horn orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features striking, spiral-shaped leaves that resemble the coils of a snail, giving it its genus name. The plant produces delicate, star-like flowers in shades of violet and white, which bloom during the early morning hours. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires specialized care in cultivation."
