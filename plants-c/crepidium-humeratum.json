    "intro": "Crepidium humeratum, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a slender stem and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a spike of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the cool, moist soils of its high-altitude habitat. Crepidium humeratum is often found in shaded, rocky areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
