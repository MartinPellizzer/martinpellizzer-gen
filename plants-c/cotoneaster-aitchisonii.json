    "intro": "Cotoneaster aitchisonii, commonly known as the Kashmir cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It features small, oval leaves that turn red in the autumn, adding ornamental value to its appearance. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that persist through the winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens across temperate regions."
