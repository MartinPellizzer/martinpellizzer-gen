    "intro": "Carex salina subsp. obtusa, commonly known as salt marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms. The plant is adapted to periodic flooding and salt spray, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
