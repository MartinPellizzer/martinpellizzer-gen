It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forested areas at high altitudes. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
