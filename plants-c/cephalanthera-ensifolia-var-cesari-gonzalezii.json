    "intro": "Cephalanthera ensifolia var. cesari-gonzalezii, commonly known as the Cesari-Gonzalez's sword-leaf lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, fragrant inflorescence of small, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by flies and beetles, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered in many areas."
