    "intro": "Clidemia coronata, commonly known as the white mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a fluffy appearance. Clidemia coronata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices."
