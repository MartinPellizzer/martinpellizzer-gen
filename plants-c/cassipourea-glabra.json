It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lanceolate, glossy leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Cassipourea glabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique appearance."
