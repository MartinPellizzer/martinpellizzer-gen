    "intro": "Chromochiton aurea, commonly known as the golden sea hare, is a species of sea slug found in tropical and subtropical marine environments. It belongs to the family Chromodorididae and is characterized by its vibrant, iridescent coloration, which can range from gold to orange and red. The plant, though not a true plant, is a type of gastropod mollusk and lacks a shell, instead having a soft, gelatinous body. Its body is covered in delicate, feathery gills used for respiration and feeding on algae. Chromochiton aurea plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the nutrient cycle through its feeding and reproductive activities."
