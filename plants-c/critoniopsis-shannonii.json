    "intro": "Critoniopsis shannonii, commonly known as the Shannon's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and a unique growth habit that involves forming symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Its small, clustered flowers are typically only a few millimeters in size, making it difficult to spot in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
