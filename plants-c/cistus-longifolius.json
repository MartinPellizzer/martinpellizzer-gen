    "intro": "Cistus longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic evergreen leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. It is often found in coastal and mountainous areas, where it plays a role in preventing soil erosion. Cistus longifolius is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
