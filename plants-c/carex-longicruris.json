    "intro": "Carex longicruris, commonly known as the long-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown, and it thrives in full to partial sunlight. Carex longicruris is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
