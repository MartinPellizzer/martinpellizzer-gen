    "intro": "Campanula mairei var. tenera, commonly known as the Maire's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features erect, slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically lanceolate and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, cascading blooms."
