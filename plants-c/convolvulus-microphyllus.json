    "intro": "Convolvulus microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is a vigorous climber, often found growing along fences or in rocky areas. It produces small, round berries that contain the seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
