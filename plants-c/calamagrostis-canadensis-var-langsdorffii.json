    "intro": "Calamagrostis canadensis var. langsdorffii, commonly known as the silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and tall, slender stems that often reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces panicles of small, blue-gray flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
