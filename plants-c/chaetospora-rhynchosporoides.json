    "intro": "Chaetospora rhynchosporoides, commonly known as the yellow-spored earth tongue, is a species of fungus belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and a pale yellow to cream-colored cap that often has a slightly fibrous texture. The spores are yellowish and are produced in a unique, branched structure called a sporophore. This fungus is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or grasslands, where it forms symbiotic relationships with certain plants. It is not considered edible and is often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance."
