    "intro": "Cyclosorus acuminatus var. ogatanus, commonly known as the Ogata's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant is native to freshwater habitats in East Asia, particularly in Japan and Korea. Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with nutrient-rich substrates."
