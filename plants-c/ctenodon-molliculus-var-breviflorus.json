    "intro": "Ctenodon molliculus var. breviflorus, commonly known as the short-flowered ctenodon, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves and vibrant floral displays. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, adding a striking visual element to its foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological needs, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
