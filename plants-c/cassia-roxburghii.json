    "intro": "Cassia roxburghii, commonly known as Indian laburnum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its bright yellow, pendulous flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant produces elongated, flat pods that contain seeds with tufts of silky hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are compound, with multiple pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and the bark is smooth and pale in color. Cassia roxburghii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
