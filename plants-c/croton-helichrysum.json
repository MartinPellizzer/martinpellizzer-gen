    "intro": "Croton helichrysum, commonly known as the golden croton, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, multicolored foliage, which often displays shades of yellow, orange, red, and green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, which can be either terminal or axillary. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens for its visual appeal."
