    "intro": "Cypripedium insigne var. mcfaddenii, commonly known as the McFadden's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination mechanism. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
