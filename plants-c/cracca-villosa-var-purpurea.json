    "intro": "Cracca villosa var. purpurea, commonly known as purple sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The leaves are typically fleshy and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along rocky coastlines. This plant is adapted to salt spray and has a unique ability to tolerate extreme coastal conditions."
