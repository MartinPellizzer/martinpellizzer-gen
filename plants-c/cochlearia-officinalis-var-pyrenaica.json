It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Cochlearia officinalis."
