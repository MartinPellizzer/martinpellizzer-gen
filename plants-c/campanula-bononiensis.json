    "intro": "Campanula bononiensis, commonly known as the Bononiensis bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, typically from late spring to early autumn."
