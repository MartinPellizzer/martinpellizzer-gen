    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna f. schizophylla, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a variant of the hawthorn species native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, often fragrant white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically ovate with serrated edges, and it is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This form is notable for its unique leaf structure, which differs from the typical form of the species."
