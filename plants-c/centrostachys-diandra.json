    "intro": "Centrostachys diandra, commonly known as the yellow starbursts, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features showy, yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Centrostachys diandra is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
