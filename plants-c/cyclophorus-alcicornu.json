It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant features elongated, narrow leaves that form a dense, cylindrical structure, which helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically producing tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind.
