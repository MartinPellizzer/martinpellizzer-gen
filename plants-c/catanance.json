    "intro": "Catanance, commonly known as the catananche, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. Catanance species often have hairy stems and leaves, and they produce small, dry fruits known as achenes. These plants are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soils."
