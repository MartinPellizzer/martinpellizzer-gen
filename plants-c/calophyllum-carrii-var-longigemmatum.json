    "intro": "Calophyllum carrii var. longigemmatum, commonly known as the long-haired calophyllum, is a tropical evergreen tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a dense covering of fine, soft hairs along the veins. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
