It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue blades that turn golden in sunlight, giving it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and heathlands. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
