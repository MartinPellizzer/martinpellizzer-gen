    "intro": "Coix ouwehandii, commonly known as the Chinese bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of wind-pollinated grasses. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some regions. Coix ouwehandii is adapted to wetland environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic ecosystems."
