    "intro": "Carex potens, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, consist of small, greenish to brownish flowers. Carex potens is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
