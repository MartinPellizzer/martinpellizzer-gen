    "intro": "Crepidium protractum var. brevidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which are typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
