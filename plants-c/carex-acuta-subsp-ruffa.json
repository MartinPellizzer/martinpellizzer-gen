    "intro": "Carex acuta subsp. ruffa, commonly known as the sharp-tailed sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. Native to wetland and marshy habitats, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomes help in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
