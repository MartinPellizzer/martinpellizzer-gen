    "intro": "Cyanea coronata, commonly known as the Hawaiian crown flower, is a member of the Rubiaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal and lowland areas of Hawaii. The plant is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Cyanea coronata is also notable for its ecological importance in Hawaiian ecosystems, where it plays a role in supporting native insect populations."
