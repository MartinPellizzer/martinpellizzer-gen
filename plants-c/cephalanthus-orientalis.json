    "intro": "Cephalanthus orientalis, commonly known as sweet pepperbush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins and a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Its root system is extensive and often forms dense colonies, making it a common sight in wetlands and stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
