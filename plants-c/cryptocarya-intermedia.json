    "intro": "Cryptocarya intermedia, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a member of the Lauraceae family. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds. The plant has a unique ability to form a crown of fronds at the top of its trunk, creating a tree-like appearance. Its leaves are evergreen and have a leathery texture, while its bark is smooth and dark in color. Cryptocarya intermedia is often found in moist, shaded environments and plays an important role in the local ecosystem."
