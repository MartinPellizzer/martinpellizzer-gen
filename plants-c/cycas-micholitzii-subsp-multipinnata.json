    "intro": "Cycas micholitzii subsp. multipinnata, commonly known as the multi-pinnate cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like leaves that are arranged in a dense, fan-like pattern. The plant produces large, cone-like structures known as strobili, which contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
