It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its hairy leaves and tubular flowers are adaptations that help it thrive in humid tropical climates. Cyanotis hirsuta is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
