    "intro": "Cryptantha torreyana subvar. calycosa, commonly known as the Sierra cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and open woodlands. Its small, oval leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This subvariety is distinguished by its slightly larger calyces compared to other varieties of Cryptantha."
