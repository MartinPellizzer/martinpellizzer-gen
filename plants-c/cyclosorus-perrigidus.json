    "intro": "Cyclosorus perrigidus, commonly known as the brittle bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that aid in capturing prey. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots. Cyclosorus perrigidus is a carnivorous plant that uses its specialized bladders to trap and digest small aquatic organisms."
