    "intro": "Cardamine indica subvar. plebeia, commonly known as the common water crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks, wet meadows, and woodland floors. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a basal rosette and small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates."
