    "intro": "Cryophytum carinatum, commonly known as the snowflake plant, is a unique succulent native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, making it ideal for rock gardens or indoor cultivation. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
