It is a hybrid between Catalpa bignonioides and Catalpa ovata, showcasing a combination of traits from both parent species. The tree is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, with shallow fissures, and it produces long, bean-like pods that contain sticky, toxic seeds.
