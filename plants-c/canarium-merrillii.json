    "intro": "Canarium merrillii, commonly known as the Philippine canarium, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces drupes that are typically used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic resins. It thrives in humid, lowland forest environments and is often found in secondary growth areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
