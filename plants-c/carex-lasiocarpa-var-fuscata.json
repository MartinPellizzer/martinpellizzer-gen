    "intro": "Carex lasiocarpa var. fuscata, commonly known as the dark-haired sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, greenish flowers that mature to a reddish-brown color. The variety fuscata is distinguished by its darker, more densely hairy leaves compared to the typical form of Carex lasiocarpa."
