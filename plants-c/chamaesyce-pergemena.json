    "intro": "Chamaesyce pergemena, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Chamaesyce pergemena is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh, drought conditions."
