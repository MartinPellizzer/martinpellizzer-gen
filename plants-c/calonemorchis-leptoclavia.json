    "intro": "Calonemorchis leptoclavia, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale green flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
