    "intro": "Corylus colurna var. chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkin-like male flowers and female flowers in separate clusters, followed by edible, hazelnut-like seeds enclosed in woody husks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional Chinese medicine."
