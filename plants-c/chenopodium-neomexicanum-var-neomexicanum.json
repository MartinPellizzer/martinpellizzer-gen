    "intro": "Chenopodium neomexicanum var. neomexicanum, commonly known as New Mexico goosefoot, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
