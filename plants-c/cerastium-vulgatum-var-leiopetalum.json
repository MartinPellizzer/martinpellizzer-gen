    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum var. leiopetalum, commonly known as white mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ground cover in shady garden settings."
