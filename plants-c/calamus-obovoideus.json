    "intro": "Calamus obovoideus, commonly known as the broad-ovate calamus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is a climbing palm characterized by its long, flexible stems and pinnately compound leaves. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and warm temperatures. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its morphology and ecological role."
