    "intro": "Cyperus trinervis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as swamps and along riverbanks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated. Cyperus trinervis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
