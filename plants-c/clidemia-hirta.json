    "intro": "Clidemia hirta, commonly known as roughleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. It produces small, fleshy berries that are often eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Clidemia hirta is often found growing on other trees, forming dense thickets in the understory of humid forests."
