    "intro": "Cyperus globulifer, commonly known as the globe sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, globular inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces small, three-lobed flowers arranged in spikelets. Cyperus globulifer is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wetland ecosystems."
