    "intro": "Cupirana aubletiana, commonly known as the Brazilian wax tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and its ability to produce a waxy substance on its leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly wavy margin. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, red berries. Cupirana aubletiana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine."
