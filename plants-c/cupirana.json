    "intro": "Cupirana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark wood with a rich, aromatic scent. The plant has compound leaves with opposite arrangement and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
