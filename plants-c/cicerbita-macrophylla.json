    "intro": "Cicerbita macrophylla, commonly known as the giant bittercress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it has a long flowering period that extends from spring to early autumn. Cicerbita macrophylla is known for its peppery taste, which makes it a sought-after ingredient in some culinary traditions."
