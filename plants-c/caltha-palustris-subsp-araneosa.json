    "intro": "Caltha palustris subsp. araneosa, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, while its stems are slender and often branched. The flowers are clustered in a loose inflorescence and bloom in early spring, contributing to its ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
