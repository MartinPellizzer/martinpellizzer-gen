    "intro": "Cheilanthes namaquensis, commonly known as the Namaqua rock fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with closely spaced, lance-shaped leaves. Its fronds are usually dark green and develop a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
