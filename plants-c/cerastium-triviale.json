    "intro": "Cerastium triviale, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically features small, rounded leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and garden beds. Its stems are often prostrate, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds. Cerastium triviale is a common weed in cultivated areas and is often found in disturbed soils."
