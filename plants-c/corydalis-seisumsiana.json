    "intro": "Corydalis seisumsiana, commonly known as the Korean Corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Korea. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, elongated capsules as its fruit, containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
