It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and is known for its clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
