    "intro": "Cathcartia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, pale green foliage and translucent, almost ethereal flowers. The plant is known for its unique ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme weather conditions, making it a subject of interest for botanists. Its blooming period is brief, occurring only during the summer months, and it is often found growing in isolated, moss-covered areas. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Cathcartia is considered a conservation priority in its native habitat."
