    "intro": "Campanula afra var. pallida, commonly known as the pale bluebell, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, which are typically pale blue to white in color. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate, early spring blooming habit."
