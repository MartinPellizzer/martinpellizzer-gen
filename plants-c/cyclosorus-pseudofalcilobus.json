It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually submerged, and it produces tiny, greenish fruits that contain minute seeds. Cyclosorus pseudofalcilobus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
