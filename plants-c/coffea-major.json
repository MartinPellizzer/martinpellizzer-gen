    "intro": "Coffea major, commonly known as the large coffee plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Ethiopia, where it grows in high altitudes. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain two seeds, which are the coffee beans used for brewing. These beans are typically processed through drying and roasting to develop their characteristic aroma and flavor. Coffea major is valued for its robust growth and adaptability to various soil types in its native habitat."
