    "intro": "Cristaria glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface. The plant is known for its unique adaptations that allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
