    "intro": "Cochranea anchusifolia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. It blooms during the spring and early summer, often after rainfall, and relies on pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cochranea anchusifolia is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
