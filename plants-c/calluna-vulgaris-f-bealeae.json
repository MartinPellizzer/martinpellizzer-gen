    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris f. bealeae, commonly known as the Beale's heather, is a compact, low-growing evergreen shrub native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. The plant typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year, providing ornamental value in both garden and natural settings. This cultivar is prized for its hardiness and ability to form a neat, compact mound, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
