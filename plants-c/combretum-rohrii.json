    "intro": "Combretum rohrii, commonly known as the red-flowered combretum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink or red, depending on the species. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
