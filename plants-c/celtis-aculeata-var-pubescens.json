    "intro": "Celtis aculeata var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent hackberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, dark blue berries in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in moist, wooded areas. The pubescent hackberry is valued for its hardiness and ability to provide habitat and food for wildlife."
