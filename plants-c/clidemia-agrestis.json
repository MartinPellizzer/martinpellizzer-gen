    "intro": "Clidemia agrestis, commonly known as the creeping mallow, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its showy, pink to purple flowers bloom in clusters during the wet season. Clidemia agrestis is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. It plays a role in local ecosystems but can also become invasive in certain areas."
