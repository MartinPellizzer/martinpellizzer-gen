    "intro": "Caraipa caespitosa, commonly known as the Caraipa grass, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly found in Brazil and Colombia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
