    "intro": "Capsella spinosa, commonly known as the prickly morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, branching stems covered in stiff, hooked hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning, followed by spherical, dry fruits called achenes. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a rough texture. Capsella spinosa is often found in disturbed soils and can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
