    "intro": "Ctenitis protensa, commonly known as the sensitive fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are sensitive to touch, often curling when disturbed. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of its fronds. Ctenitis protensa plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
