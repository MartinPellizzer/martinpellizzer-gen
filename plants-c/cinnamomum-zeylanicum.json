It is characterized by its aromatic, dark brown bark, which is harvested and dried to produce the spice cinnamon. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers and heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its essential oils, rich in cinnamaldehyde, contribute to its distinctive flavor and medicinal properties. Cinnamon is widely cultivated in tropical regions for both culinary and pharmaceutical uses."
