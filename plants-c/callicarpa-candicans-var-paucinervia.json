    "intro": "Callicarpa candicans var. paucinervia, commonly known as the red-berried beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by striking orange-red berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not palatable to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
