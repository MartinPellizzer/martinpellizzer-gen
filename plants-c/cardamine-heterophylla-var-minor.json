    "intro": "Cardamine heterophylla var. minor, commonly known as the lesser water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and moist soils in temperate regions. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted for aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stems. Its root system consists of rhizomes that help anchor it in waterlogged soils. This species is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize shoreline vegetation and support aquatic life."
