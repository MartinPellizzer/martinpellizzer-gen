    "intro": "Calobota flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible calobota, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring slender, branching stems that often exhibit a flexible or creeping growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale green to yellow in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Calobota flexuosa is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along riverbanks."
