    "intro": "Crataegus melanocarpa var. polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leaved hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits called pomes, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with serrated margins, and turn vibrant shades of red or orange in the fall. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in woodland habitats."
