    "intro": "Corylus cornuta subsp. cornuta, commonly known as the horned hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, or \"horned\" buds, which are a key identifying feature. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, typically ripening in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open woodlands."
