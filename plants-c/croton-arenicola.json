    "intro": "Croton arenicola, commonly known as the sand croton, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often lobed and vary in color from green to reddish hues. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange or red berries. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Croton arenicola is often used in traditional medicine and as a decorative plant in dryland gardens."
