    "intro": "Cybianthus simplex, commonly known as the simple cybianthus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a compact, shrub-like form. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Cybianthus simplex is often used in native plant gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
