    "intro": "Cereus nickelsii, commonly known as the Nickels' candleplant, is a cactus species native to the dry regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, a feature typical of many desert cacti. Its stems are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Cereus nickelsii is often cultivated for its striking appearance and ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
