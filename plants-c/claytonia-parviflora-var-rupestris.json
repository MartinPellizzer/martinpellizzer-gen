    "intro": "Claytonia parviflora var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock Claytonia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, dry environments."
