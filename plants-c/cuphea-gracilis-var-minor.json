    "intro": "Cuphea gracilis var. minor, commonly known as the slender flamebeard, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to Mexico. It features whorled clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that resemble flames, blooming throughout the growing season. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
