    "intro": "Cerastium pumilum var. litigiosum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It features small, white flowers and has a mat-forming growth habit, which helps it thrive in rocky or gravelly soils. The leaves are typically hairy and arranged in a rosette, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions. This variety is often found in open, sunny areas at high elevations."
