    "intro": "Cocculus planiflorus, commonly known as the devil's ivy, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by distinctive, inflated, greenish berries. These berries turn bright red when mature and are a source of seeds for propagation. While not widely cultivated for ornamental purposes, it is sometimes grown as a houseplant due to its resilience and adaptability."
