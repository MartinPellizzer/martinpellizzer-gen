    "intro": "Convolvulus saxicola, commonly known as the rock convolvulus, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a perennial herb with slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pale purple or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Convolvulus saxicola thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on slopes, cliffs, or among stones."
