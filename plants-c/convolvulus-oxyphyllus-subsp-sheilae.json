    "intro": "Convolvulus oxyphyllus subsp. sheilae, commonly known as Sheil's bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features tendrils that allow it to climb or trail along the ground, and its flowers are usually pale purple or white with five petals. The leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
