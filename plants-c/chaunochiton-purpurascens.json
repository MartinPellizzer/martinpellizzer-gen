    "intro": "Chaunochiton purpurascens, commonly known as the purple sea snail, is a species of predatory sea snail belonging to the family Chaunoclitidae. It is characterized by its elongated, spiral shell that is often adorned with a distinctive purple hue. This marine gastropod is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it hunts small invertebrates using its radula. The shell provides protection against predators and is often covered in a calcareous layer. Its ecological role includes contributing to the biodiversity of intertidal zones and serving as prey for larger marine animals."
