    "intro": "Ctenitis ampla, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific islands. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant has a sturdy, unbranched trunk that is covered in a fibrous, spongy material called the rachis. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Ctenitis ampla thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests and lowland rainforests."
