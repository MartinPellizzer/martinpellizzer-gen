    "intro": "Chenopodium nevadense, commonly known as the Great Basin goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has alternate, broadly ovate to elliptic leaves with a rough texture and a bluish-green hue. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in cup-like structures called inflorescences. Chenopodium nevadense is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
