    "intro": "Cereus weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and clusters of white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a thick, fleshy structure that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Cereus weberbaueri is often cultivated for its striking appearance and resilience in low-maintenance gardens."
