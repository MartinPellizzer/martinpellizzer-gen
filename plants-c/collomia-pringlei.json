It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its showy, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions. It has hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Collomia pringlei is often found in open habitats such as meadows and forest edges."
