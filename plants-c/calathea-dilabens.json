    "intro": "Calathea dilabens, commonly known as the veined calathea, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, veined leaves that exhibit a unique coloration pattern, often with a mix of green, silver, and pink tones. The plant belongs to the Marantaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Its foliage is often described as having a \"butterfly\" appearance due to the way the veins curve and spread across the leaves. Calathea dilabens requires consistent moisture and high humidity to maintain its vibrant appearance."
