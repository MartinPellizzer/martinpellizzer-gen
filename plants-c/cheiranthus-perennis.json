    "intro": "Cheiranthus perennis, commonly known as the perennial wallflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Cheiranthus perennis is often found growing in rocky soils and along walls, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
