    "intro": "Cystium yuccanum, commonly known as the Yucca-like Cystium, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Cistaceae, which includes various shrubs adapted to dry environments. The plant features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in clusters and attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cystium yuccanum is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
