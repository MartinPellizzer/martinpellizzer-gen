These plants are characterized by their striking, spiny leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that often bloom in shades of blue, purple, or white. Castelaria species are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. They are adapted to salt spray and can tolerate harsh maritime conditions. The genus includes several species, such as Castelaria maritima, which is native to the Mediterranean region."
