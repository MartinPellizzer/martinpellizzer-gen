    "intro": "Cyrtandra \u00d7 conradtii, commonly known as the hybrid Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant belonging to the Campanulaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Cyrtandra corymbosa and Cyrtandra pedata, characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant is native to the Hawaiian Islands, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. It has small, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and is often found growing in rocky or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and hybrid origin, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
