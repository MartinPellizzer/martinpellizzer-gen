    "intro": "Coelogyne membranifolia, commonly known as the membranous orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and gracefully arching inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often covered in a thin, waxy layer that helps retain moisture. Coelogyne membranifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its delicate, ephemeral blooms."
