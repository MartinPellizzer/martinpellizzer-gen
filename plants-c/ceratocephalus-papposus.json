    "intro": "Ceratocephalus papposus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual plant that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fruit is a small, hairy capsule that releases seeds with white, feathery pappus for wind dispersal. The species is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
