    "intro": "Carduus centaureae, commonly known as the purpleweed or centaury, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its striking purple to violet flowers, which are typically arranged in a dense, spherical inflorescence. The plant has spiny leaves and stems, which help it to deter herbivores. Native to Europe and western Asia, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
