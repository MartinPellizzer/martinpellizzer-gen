    "intro": "Carex polyrrhiza var. gynobasis, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike that bears small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is distinguished by its reduced female flowers, which are clustered at the base of the spike, giving it its botanical name."
