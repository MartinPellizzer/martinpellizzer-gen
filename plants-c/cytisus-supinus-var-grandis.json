    "intro": "Cytisus supinus var. grandis, commonly known as the creeping yellow flowering broom, is a low-growing shrub native to western Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, woody stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover."
