    "intro": "Cactus severinii, commonly known as the Severinii cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Central America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, pale green spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for desert gardens."
