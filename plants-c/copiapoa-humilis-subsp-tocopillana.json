    "intro": "Copiapoa humilis subsp. tocopillana, commonly known as the Tocopilla cactus, is a species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a low-growing, columnar cactus with a dense, woolly covering that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces pale green to blue-green stems and has clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months. It is adapted to extreme drought conditions and requires minimal water once established. This subspecies is prized for its unique appearance and resilience in harsh climates."
