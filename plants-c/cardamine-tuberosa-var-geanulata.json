    "intro": "Cardamine tuberosa var. geanulata, commonly known as the mountain buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a single umbel, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its tuberous roots are an important feature, contributing to its ability to store nutrients and survive in cooler climates. It is often found in the Appalachian region of North America."
