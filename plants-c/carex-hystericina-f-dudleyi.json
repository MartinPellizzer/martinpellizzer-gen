    "intro": "Carex hystericina f. dudleyi, commonly known as the Dudley's panicled sedge, is a variant of the panicled sedge species native to eastern North America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, usually green or brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its botanical features include fibrous roots, cylindrical stems, and a dense arrangement of flowering spikes. It is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
