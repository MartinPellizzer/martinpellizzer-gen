    "intro": "Callitriche genuina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has delicate, narrow leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern along its branching stems. Its small, white flowers appear in late spring and early summer, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Callitriche genuina plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
