    "intro": "Crataegus rosaeformis, commonly known as the roseleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elliptical leaves that are typically rose-like in appearance, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are clustered in cymes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in the fall, providing food for various birds and small mammals. Crataegus rosaeformis is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
