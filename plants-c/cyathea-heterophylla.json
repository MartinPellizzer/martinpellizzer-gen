    "intro": "Cyathea heterophylla, commonly known as the variable tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive ability to produce two different types of fronds\u2014sterile and fertile\u2014on the same plant, a trait known as heterophylly. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Cyathea heterophylla plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's forests, providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity."
