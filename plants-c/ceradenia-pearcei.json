    "intro": "Ceradenia pearcei, commonly known as the pearce's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, elongated inflorescence bearing several blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ceradenia pearcei is considered a vulnerable species."
