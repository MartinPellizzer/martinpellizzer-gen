    "intro": "Cytinus hypocistis subsp. pityusensis, commonly known as the \"broad-leafed broomrape,\" is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of legumes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its unique structure includes a swollen stem base called a \"cyst\" that attaches to the host. This subspecies is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and its hemiparasitic lifestyle."
