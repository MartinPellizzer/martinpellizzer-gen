    "intro": "Conyza variegata, commonly known as the variable weed or the dandelion-like weed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa. It features slender stems and small, yellow flower heads that resemble those of dandelions. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Conyza variegata is considered a problematic weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
