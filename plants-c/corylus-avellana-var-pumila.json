    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf hazel, is a compact shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a serrated margin. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are male flowers, followed by female flowers that develop into edible hazelnuts. Its ornamental value comes from its dense, rounded growth habit and attractive foliage. It is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
