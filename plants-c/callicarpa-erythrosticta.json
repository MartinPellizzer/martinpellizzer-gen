    "intro": "Callicarpa erythrosticta, commonly known as the red-streaked beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces distinctive violet to purple berries that ripen in the fall, often retaining their color into winter. These berries are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not palatable to humans. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
