    "intro": "Combretum punctatum var. squamosum, commonly known as the rough-leaved flame bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, papery, and often peeling bark, which gives it a unique appearance. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough, scaly texture, and they tend to shed easily. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry, well-drained conditions."
