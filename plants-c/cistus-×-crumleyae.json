    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 crumleyae, commonly known as the Crumley's rockrose, is a hybrid shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or coastal gardens. Its leaves are typically leathery and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cistus \u00d7 crumleyae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
