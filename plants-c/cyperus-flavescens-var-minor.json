    "intro": "Cyperus flavescens var. minor, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like stems with narrow, linear leaves that are usually pale green in color. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces small, three-angled fruits. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
