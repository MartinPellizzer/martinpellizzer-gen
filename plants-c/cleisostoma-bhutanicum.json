    "intro": "Cleisostoma bhutanicum, commonly known as the Bhutanese orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Bhutan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant prefers cool, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in shaded forest areas. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited research, its conservation status remains a concern."
