    "intro": "Capraea cinerea, commonly known as the common rock cress, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, linear leaves and produces small, pale yellow or white flowers. This species is typically found growing in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in alpine or arctic regions. Capraea cinerea is adapted to harsh environments, with a short growing season and the ability to survive in low-nutrient soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas in its native range."
