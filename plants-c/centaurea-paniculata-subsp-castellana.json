    "intro": "Centaurea paniculata subsp. castellana, commonly known as the Castellana globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, globe-shaped flower heads composed of numerous small, pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as scrublands and grasslands. It produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
