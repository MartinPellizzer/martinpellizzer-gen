    "intro": "Cactus stenocephalus, commonly known as the narrow-headed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered in sparse, white to grayish spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, often at night. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The narrow-headed cactus is well adapted to desert conditions, with a slow growth rate and a long lifespan."
