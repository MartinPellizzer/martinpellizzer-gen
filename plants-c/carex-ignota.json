    "intro": "Carex ignota, commonly known as the unknown sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to parts of North America, particularly in the eastern United States. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Carex ignota is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
