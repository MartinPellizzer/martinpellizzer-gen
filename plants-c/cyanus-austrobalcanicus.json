It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its striking blue to violet flowers. Cyanus austrobalcanicus is a perennial herb that produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local pollinators. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and biodiversity in Mediterranean climates."
