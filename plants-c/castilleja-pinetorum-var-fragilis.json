It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, orange, or yellow flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients, often growing on conifers like Douglas fir. Its fragrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This species is adapted to dry, open habitats and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils."
