    "intro": "Cyclosorus pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered cyclosorus, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters, which are arranged in a distinctive circular pattern on the undersides of its fertile leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth where humidity levels are high. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus pauciflorus is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
