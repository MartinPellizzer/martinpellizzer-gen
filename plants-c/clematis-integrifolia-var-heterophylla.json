It is characterized by its alternate, palmately compound leaves that vary in shape and size, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is often cultivated as a decorative vine in gardens and landscapes."
