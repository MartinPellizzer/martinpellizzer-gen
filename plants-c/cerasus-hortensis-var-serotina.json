    "intro": "Cerasus hortensis var. serotina, commonly known as the late cherry or Japanese late cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its oval, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not widely consumed. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and floral display. The variety is noted for its late flowering habit, which distinguishes it from other cherry species."
