    "intro": "Cinnagrostis intermedia, commonly known as goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across various habitats. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Cinnagrostis intermedia thrives in full sun and is often found in meadows, prairies, and along roadsides."
