    "intro": "Carex tribuloides var. cristata, commonly known as the cristate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
