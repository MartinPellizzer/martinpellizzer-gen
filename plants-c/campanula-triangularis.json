The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches and prefers well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow. Campanula triangularis is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
