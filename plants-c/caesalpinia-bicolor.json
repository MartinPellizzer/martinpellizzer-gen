    "intro": "Caesalpinia bicolor, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its bright red and yellow bipinnate leaves and showy, clustered orange or red flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces long, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. Caesalpinia bicolor is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
