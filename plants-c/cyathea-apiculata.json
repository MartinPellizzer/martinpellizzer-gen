    "intro": "Cyathea apiculata, commonly known as the toothbrush tree, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its fronds, which are typically found at the ends of the longest leaves. Cyathea apiculata thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
