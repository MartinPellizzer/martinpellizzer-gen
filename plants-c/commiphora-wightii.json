    "intro": "Commiphora wightii, commonly known as Indian frankincense or guggul, is a small evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces a resinous sap that is tapped from the bark, which has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and as a fragrance in incense. This resin, known as guggul, contains compounds like resinous gums and essential oils, contributing to its medicinal properties. Commiphora wightii thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry deciduous forests."
