    "intro": "Clidemia bernardii, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Hawaiian velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, including Hawaii, Tahiti, and parts of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, attracting various pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Clidemia bernardii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction make it an invasive species in some regions."
