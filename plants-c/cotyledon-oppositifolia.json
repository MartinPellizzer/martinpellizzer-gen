    "intro": "Cotyledon oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leafed cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant belongs to the family Aizoaceae, also known as the ice plant family, and is known for its ability to store water in its leaves. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. Cotyledon oppositifolia is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
