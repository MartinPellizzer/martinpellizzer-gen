    "intro": "Camaridium mombachoense, commonly known as the Mombacho orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Camaridium mombachoense is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for its protection."
