    "intro": "Cylindropuntia imbricata subsp. cardenche, commonly known as the Cardenche cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are segmented and covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a succulent structure that allows it to store water efficiently. This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
