    "intro": "Carex halleriana f. pedunculata, commonly known as the Haller's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, a common reproductive strategy among sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
