    "intro": "Crotalaria aiantha, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its yellow, spurred flowers and hairy stems, which are typical features of the Crotalaria genus. The plant is an annual herb that grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its seeds are adapted for dispersal by wind, and the plant plays a role in soil stabilization. The leaves are alternate and pinnately divided, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
