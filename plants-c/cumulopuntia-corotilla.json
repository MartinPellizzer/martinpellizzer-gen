    "intro": "Cumulopuntia corotilla, commonly known as the cloud cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that often branch into a tree-like structure, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on long, slender pedicels. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and aiding in survival in harsh environments. Cumulopuntia corotilla is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
