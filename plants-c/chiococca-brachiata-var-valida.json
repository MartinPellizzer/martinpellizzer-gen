It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves with prominent red veins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
