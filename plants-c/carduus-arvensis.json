    "intro": "Carduus arvensis, commonly known as the common sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are edible when young but become bitter and less palatable as they mature. The species is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
