    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 burberryana, commonly known as the Burberry orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Cattleya \u00d7 burberryana is prized in horticulture for its fragrance and long-lasting blooms."
