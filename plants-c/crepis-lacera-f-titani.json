    "intro": "Crepis lacera f. titani, commonly known as the Tibetan wallflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold climate of its native habitat. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of yellow and orange, are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
