    "intro": "Carlina vulgaris, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in a spherical head. Its botanical name, Carlina, is derived from the Latin word \"caro,\" meaning flesh, possibly referring to the fleshy appearance of its flower heads. Carlina vulgaris is often found in open habitats and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
