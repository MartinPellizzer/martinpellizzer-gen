    "intro": "Cerastium alpinum var. glanduliferum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces tiny, glandular-tipped stems, which give it its varietal name. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments and is often found in open, sunny areas at high elevations. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a decorative plant."
