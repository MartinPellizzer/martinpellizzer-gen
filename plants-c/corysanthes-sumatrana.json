    "intro": "Corysanthes sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often fragrant blooms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually large and showy, with intricate petal structures that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
