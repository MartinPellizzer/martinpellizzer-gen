    "intro": "Cakile maritima subsp. euxina, commonly known as the European sea rocket, is a halophyte native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and tidal zones. The plant has a compact, low-growing structure with fleshy, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in racemes, typically blooming in spring. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
