    "intro": "Cymbidium giganteum var. wilsonii, commonly known as the Wilson's giant orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 cm in diameter, typically in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its beauty and resilience."
