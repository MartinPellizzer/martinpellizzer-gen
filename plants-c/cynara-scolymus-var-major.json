    "intro": "Cynara scolymus var. major, commonly known as giant artichoke, is a cultivar of the artichoke plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, robust leaves that form a dense rosette and its edible, spiny flower heads. The plant produces a unique, thistle-like inflorescence that is harvested before the flowers open. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, with a slightly bitter taste, while the heart and stem are prized for their tender texture. This variety is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
