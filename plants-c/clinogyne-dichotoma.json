It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a stout, branching stem that becomes woody with age, and its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs. Clinogyne dichotoma thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
