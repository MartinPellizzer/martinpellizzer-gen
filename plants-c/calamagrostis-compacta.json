    "intro": "Calamagrostis compacta, commonly known as the compact reedgrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. It produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flower heads that bloom in late summer. Calamagrostis compacta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for wildlife and stabilizing wetland soils."
