    "intro": "Carex latinervia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex latinervia is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
