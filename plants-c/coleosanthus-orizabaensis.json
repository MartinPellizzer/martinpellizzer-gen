    "intro": "Coleosanthus orizabaensis, commonly known as the Orizaba mountain yew, is a rare and endangered plant species native to high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is a member of the Taxaceae family, characterized by its coniferous appearance and unique reproductive structures. The plant produces small, reddish-brown seeds enclosed in woody cones, which are typically dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
