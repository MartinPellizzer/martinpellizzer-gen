    "intro": "Cuphea odonellii, commonly known as the velvet tangerine or Mexican firecracker, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by hummingbirds, which are attracted to its nectar-rich blossoms. Cuphea odonellii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil and full sun."
