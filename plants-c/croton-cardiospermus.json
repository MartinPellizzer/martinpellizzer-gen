    "intro": "Croton cardiospermus, commonly known as the heartseed croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruits that contain three seeds. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, orange or red aril, which is a feature that aids in seed dispersal by animals. Croton cardiospermus is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage and unique fruit structure."
