    "intro": "Carex annectens var. xanthocarpa, commonly known as the yellow-fruited sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces distinctive yellowish to reddish-brown spikelets that mature in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The inflorescence consists of two distinct spikelets, with the lower one being sterile and the upper one bearing the showy, yellowish flowers."
