    "intro": "Carex austrozhejiangensis, commonly known as the Zhejiang sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to China, specifically the Zhejiang province, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
