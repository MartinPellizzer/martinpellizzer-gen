    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 laxus var. nigrescens, commonly known as the dark-flowered rock rose, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, dark purple to almost black flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its aromatic leaves and resilience to drought make it a popular choice for xeriscaping. It also plays a role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
