    "intro": "Cypripedium neoguineense, commonly known as the New Guinea lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the lowland rainforests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows from a rhizome and produces a single, upright stem with a few broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or purple with a yellow or white lip, and it blooms during the wet season. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
