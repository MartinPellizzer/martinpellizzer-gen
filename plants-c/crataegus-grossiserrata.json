    "intro": "Crataegus grossiserrata, commonly known as the rough-leaved hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its serrated, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Crataegus grossiserrata is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along streambanks."
