    "intro": "Cineraria verna, commonly known as the spring cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of blue or purple flowers. The leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and the plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its ornamental value. Cineraria verna blooms in early spring, adding a splash of color to gardens during the cooler months."
