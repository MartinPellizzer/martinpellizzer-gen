    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 pageanum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium micranthum. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant features a pseudobulb and produces a single, erect flowering stem with a few leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with acidic soil. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
