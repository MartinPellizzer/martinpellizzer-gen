    "intro": "Ctenopteris multicaudata, commonly known as the multi-tailed sea holly, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply divided fronds that resemble the shape of a sea urchin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near coastal areas or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores for propagation. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its hardy nature."
