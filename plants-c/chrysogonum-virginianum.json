    "intro": "Chrysogonum virginianum, commonly known as the goldenroot, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features upright stems that are covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in a raceme. Its root system is fibrous and has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded to partially shaded areas."
