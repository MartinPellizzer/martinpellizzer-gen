    "intro": "Carex oligocarpa f. triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered sedges, is a variant of the Carex genus, which includes sedges. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like appearance and triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike of small, three-flowered female spikes, which is a distinguishing feature of this form. The leaves are usually narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
