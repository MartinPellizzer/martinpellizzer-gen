    "intro": "Carex vallis-rosetto var. purpurea, commonly known as purple marsh sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and features slender, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces small, inconspicuous brownish flowers arranged in spikelets, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet environments such as marshes, wetlands, and along streambanks. Its ornamental value comes from its striking purple foliage, making it a desirable plant for wetland gardens."
