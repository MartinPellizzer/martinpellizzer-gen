    "intro": "Cyathea axillaris, commonly known as the axillary tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in tropical rainforests, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor firmly in the soil while absorbing nutrients from decomposing organic matter. Cyathea axillaris plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
