    "intro": "Cyathea decora, commonly known as the ornate tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and longevity. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Cyathea decora is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
