    "intro": "Conocarpus procumbens, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea apple, is a tropical shrub native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with numerous horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that contain a single seed. Its ability to tolerate brackish water makes it an important component of mangrove ecosystems. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its saline environment."
