    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha f. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive hawthorn, is a botanical variant of the common hawthorn. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often twisted fruits that resemble other plant species, a trait that gives it its common name. The plant is typically found in woodland edges and hedgerows, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are white or pale pink, appearing in early spring, and it produces berries in the fall. This form is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and providing food for wildlife."
