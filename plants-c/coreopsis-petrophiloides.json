    "intro": "Coreopsis petrophiloides, commonly known as the rock coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a compact growth habit that makes it suitable for rock gardens. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
