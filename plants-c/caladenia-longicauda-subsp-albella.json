It features a slender, erect stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf that is often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, slender flower spike bearing a single, pale pink to white flower with a distinctive, elongated spur. Its habitat consists of sandy soils in open woodlands and heathlands. The species is notable for its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its restricted distribution."
