    "intro": "Corydalis incisa var. pseudomakinoana, commonly known as the Japanese slender corydalis, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia. It features delicate, slender stems that often grow close to the ground, with lance-shaped leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
