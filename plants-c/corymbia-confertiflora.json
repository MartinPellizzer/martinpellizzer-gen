    "intro": "Corymbia confertiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bloodwood, is a species of eucalypt native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces large, showy white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which attract a variety of pollinators. It is a hardy tree that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in woodland and shrubland habitats. The wood of Corymbia confertiflora is dense and strong, historically used by Indigenous Australians for tools and weapons."
