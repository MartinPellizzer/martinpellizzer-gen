    "intro": "Clusia columnaris, commonly known as the columnar clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright, columnar growth habit and thick, waxy leaves that are usually dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by orange or red berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its resistance to pests and diseases. Clusia columnaris is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and its use in traditional medicine."
