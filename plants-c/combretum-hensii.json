    "intro": "Combretum hensii, commonly known as the red-stemmed bushwillow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in terminal spikes, followed by three-lobed, woody capsules that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Combretum hensii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
