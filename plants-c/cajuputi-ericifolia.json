    "intro": "Cajuputi ericifolia, commonly known as the rough heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Cajuputi ericifolia is typically found in moist, acidic soils in forest understories or along stream banks. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small animals."
