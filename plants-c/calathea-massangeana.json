    "intro": "Calathea massangeana, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful leaves that often display intricate patterns and hues of green, pink, and white. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent humidity and well-draining soil. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
