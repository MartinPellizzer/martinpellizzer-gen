    "intro": "Coelia macrostachya var. integrilabia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved coelia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple to white in color. The leaves are smooth and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species is adapted to thrive in dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. It is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and ecological interest."
