    "intro": "Campanula gumbetica, commonly known as the Gumbet bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically blue to purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these ecosystems. Campanula gumbetica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive flowers."
