    "intro": "Collabium carinatum, commonly known as the ridge-leafed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette and feature a distinct midrib or ridge. It is a carnivorous plant that relies on these bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor water."
