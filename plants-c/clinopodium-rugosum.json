    "intro": "Clinopodium rugosum, commonly known as rough hedge-nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants known for their medicinal and culinary uses. The plant is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. Its small, clustered flowers are typically pink or purple, and it produces small, dry fruits called nutlets. Clinopodium rugosum is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils."
