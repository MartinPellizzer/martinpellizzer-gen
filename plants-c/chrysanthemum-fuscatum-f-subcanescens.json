It features finely divided, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers in the fall, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its unique foliage and late-season blooms add both visual interest and ecological value to gardens."
