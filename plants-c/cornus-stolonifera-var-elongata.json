    "intro": "Cornus stolonifera var. elongata, commonly known as the creeping dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features slender, arching stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats or low-growing thickets. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red or purple berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a slightly toothed base. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
