    "intro": "Carex foetida var. minor, commonly known as the lesser stinking sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are often submerged or partially submerged in water. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is noted for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the plant is in bloom."
