    "intro": "Cinnamomum zeylanicum var. roxburghii, commonly known as Sri Lankan cinnamon, is a variant of the cinnamon tree native to Sri Lanka. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers followed by oval, dark blue berries containing winged seeds. Its bark is the primary source of the aromatic spice cinnamon, which is harvested by peeling off the inner bark layers. This variety is valued for its distinct flavor and is widely used in both culinary and traditional medicinal applications."
