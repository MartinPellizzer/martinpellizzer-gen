    "intro": "Campomanesia cyanea, commonly known as the purple mangosteen, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northeastern South America. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. The fruit is a round, segmented berry that turns from green to purple when ripe, containing a juicy, white, segmented aril around the seed. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. It is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its edible fruit, which is appreciated for its sweet, tangy flavor."
