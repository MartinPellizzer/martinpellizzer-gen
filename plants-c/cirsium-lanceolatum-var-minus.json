    "intro": "Cirsium lanceolatum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems covered in dense, spiny bracts. The plant produces purple to pink flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by a series of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its leaves are generally smaller and more lanceolate compared to the typical form of Cirsium lanceolatum. This variety is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
