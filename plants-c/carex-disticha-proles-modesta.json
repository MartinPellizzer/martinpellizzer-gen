    "intro": "Carex disticha proles modesta, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually clustered in a cylindrical inflorescence. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. The leaves are often slightly folded and have a distinct midrib, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance."
