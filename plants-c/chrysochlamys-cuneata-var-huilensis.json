    "intro": "Chrysochlamys cuneata var. huilensis, commonly known as the Huil\u00e9n goldenbush, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and striking golden-yellow foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid climates."
