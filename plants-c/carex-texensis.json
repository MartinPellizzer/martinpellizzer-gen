    "intro": "Carex texensis, commonly known as the Texas sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Carex texensis is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
