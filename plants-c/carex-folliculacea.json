It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into dry, capsule-like fruits called follicles. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. Carex folliculacea is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms."
