    "intro": "Chamaesyce pilosula, commonly known as the hairy sandmat, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, spreading stems covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly wavy margin. Chamaesyce pilosula is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun."
