    "intro": "[WRONG START] Codia urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging cordia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that can cause a stinging sensation when touched, due to the presence of urticating hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange or red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Cordia urticifolia plays a role in local ecosystems as a food source for certain wildlife and as a component of secondary vegetation."
