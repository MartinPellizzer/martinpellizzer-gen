    "intro": "Cuscuta brevistyla var. globulosa, commonly known as the globular dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive globular shape due to its dense, spherical arrangement of stems. The plant is native to regions of North America and is often found growing on various host plants such as grasses and shrubs. Its life cycle involves germination, attachment to a host, and the development of a network of haustoria to extract water and nutrients. This species is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role as a parasite in diverse habitats."
