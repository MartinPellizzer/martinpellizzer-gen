    "intro": "Catalpa hirsuta, commonly known as the wooly catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The tree produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, appearing in late spring. Its fruit is a long, slender pod that splits open to release its seeds. Catalpa hirsuta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
