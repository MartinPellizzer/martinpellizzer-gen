It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
