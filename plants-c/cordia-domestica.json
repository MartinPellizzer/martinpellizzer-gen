    "intro": "Cordia domestica, commonly known as the African butter tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces edible fruits that are rich in oils and have a buttery texture, hence its common name. Its bark and leaves are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Cordia domestica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and practical uses in local communities."
