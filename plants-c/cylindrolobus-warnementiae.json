    "intro": "Cylindrolobus warnementiae, commonly known as the Warnem\u00fcnde cylinder-lobed plant, is a rare flowering plant native to specific coastal regions. It is characterized by its unique cylindrical leaves that are lobed in a distinctive pattern, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray from the sea. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
