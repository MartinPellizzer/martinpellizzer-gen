    "intro": "Copiapoa marginata subsp. marginata, commonly known as the marginate cactus, is a species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, cylindrical stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late winter or early spring. This subspecies is notable for its ability to store water in its stem and its role in the local ecosystem."
