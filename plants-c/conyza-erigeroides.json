    "intro": "Conyza erigeroides, commonly known as the common blueweed, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its blue to purple composite flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. Native to Africa, it has been introduced to various regions, including parts of the United States, where it often grows in disturbed soils. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its invasive potential in some areas. It is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open habitats."
