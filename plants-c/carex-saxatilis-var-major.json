It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces spikes of small, three-lobed flowers. This variety thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in stream banks, marshes, and other wetland habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
