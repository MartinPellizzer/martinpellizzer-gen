    "intro": "Campanula semisphaerica, commonly known as the spherical bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
