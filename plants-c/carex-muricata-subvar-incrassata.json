    "intro": "Carex muricata subvar. incrassata, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces spikes of small, usually green or brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
