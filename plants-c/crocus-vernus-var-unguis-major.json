    "intro": "Crocus vernus var. unguis-major, commonly known as the giant purple crocus, is a striking perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It features large, showy flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, with a distinctive, elongated petal known as the \"spur.\" The plant produces a single bloom per stem, which emerges in early spring before the leaves appear. Its bulbs are adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils and prefer full sun to partial shade. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
