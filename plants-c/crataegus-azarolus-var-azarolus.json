    "intro": "Crataegus azarolus var. azarolus, commonly known as the Turkish hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and features thorny branches with ovate to elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in spring, which are followed by red or orange berries in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hedge. The berries are edible but often used in culinary or medicinal applications due to their tart flavor and high vitamin C content."
