    "intro": "Cyperus sellowii, commonly known as the swamp spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in wet or marshy habitats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Cyperus sellowii is often found in wetlands, along riverbanks, and in areas with standing water. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
