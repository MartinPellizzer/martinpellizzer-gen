    "intro": "Campanula pseudolanceolata f. umbraticola, commonly known as the shade-loving bellflower, is a compact, herbaceous perennial that thrives in low-light conditions. It features slender, upright stems with clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range from blue to purple in color. The foliage is typically dark green and somewhat hairy, which helps it retain moisture in shaded environments. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value in woodland gardens and shaded borders. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is relatively disease-resistant."
