    "intro": "Cupania mutabilis, commonly known as the variable cupua\u00e7u, is a tropical shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in an alternate pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, elongated fruits resembling large cherries. Its fruit contains a high concentration of lipids, making it an important source of natural oils. The botanical features of Cupania mutabilis make it both ecologically significant and economically valuable in regional agriculture."
