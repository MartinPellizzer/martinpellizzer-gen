    "intro": "Callipteris wallichii, commonly known as the silver fern or Himalayan silver fern, is a shrub native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast against its dark green stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient and hardy species. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, particularly in regions with mild winters."
