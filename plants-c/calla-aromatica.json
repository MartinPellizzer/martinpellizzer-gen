    "intro": "Calla aromatica, commonly known as the fragrant calla, is a striking plant characterized by its large, white, spatulate leaves and a single, showy, white flower with a yellow spadix. Native to certain regions of South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's most distinctive feature is its aromatic scent, which is strongest in the evening. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its elegant appearance and unique fragrance. Calla aromatica prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade for optimal growth."
