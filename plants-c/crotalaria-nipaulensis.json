    "intro": "Crotalaria nipaulensis, commonly known as the Nepal crownflower, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and India. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive crown-like arrangement of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, and the flowers are usually yellow or orange with a distinctive crown of petals. It is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
