    "intro": "Camissoniopsis pallida subsp. pallida, commonly known as the pale camisson, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically features slender, hairy stems and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its aesthetic appeal in native plant gardens."
