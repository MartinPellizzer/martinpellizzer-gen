    "intro": "Couthovia nymanii, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in dense undergrowth. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat destruction, Couthovia nymanii is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
