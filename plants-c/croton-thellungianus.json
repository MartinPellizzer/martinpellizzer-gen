    "intro": "Croton thellungianus, commonly known as the velvetleaf croton, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are usually a deep green with a slightly velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by orange or red berries containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and clearings. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
