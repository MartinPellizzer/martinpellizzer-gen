    "intro": "Coriaria arborea var. kermadecensis, commonly known as the Kermadec coriaria, is a shrub native to the Kermadec Islands in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to the humid, subtropical climate of its native region. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
