    "intro": "Camellia sinensis var. lasiocalyx, commonly known as the small-leaved tea plant, is a variant of the tea plant native to southern China. It is characterized by its smaller, more rounded leaves compared to other Camellia sinensis varieties. The plant typically grows in subtropical climates and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it is cultivated for both ornamental and tea production purposes. This variety is less common than the large-leaf type but is valued for its unique flavor profile in specialty teas."
