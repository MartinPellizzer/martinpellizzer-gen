    "intro": "Cynosurus pouzolzii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are tightly rolled when young, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is often found in low-fertility soils. Cynosurus pouzolzii is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
