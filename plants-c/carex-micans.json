It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flower spikes that are typically wind-pollinated. Carex micans thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and shaded woodlands. Its silver-blue foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
