    "intro": "Chupalon cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped fronds that are often bioluminescent at night. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique leaf structure allows for efficient water retention and light absorption. Chupalon cordatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
