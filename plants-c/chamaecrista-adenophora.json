    "intro": "Chamaecrista adenophora, commonly known as the hairy crown flower, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with small, hairy stipules. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
