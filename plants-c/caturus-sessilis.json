    "intro": "Caturus sessilis, commonly known as the sessile caturus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red in color, blooming during the warm season. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in its native habitat."
