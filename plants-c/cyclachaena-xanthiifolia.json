    "intro": "Cyclachaena xanthiifolia, commonly known as the yellow-leafed cyclachaena, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically bright yellow or greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
