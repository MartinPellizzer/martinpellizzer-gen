    "intro": "Cleome hostmannii, commonly known as the Mexican spider flower, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, spindly stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn. Cleome hostmannii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
