    "intro": "Cestrum bourgeauianum, commonly known as the Bourgeau's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its berries are red and edible, though they contain toxic compounds that can be harmful if ingested in large quantities. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local wildlife."
