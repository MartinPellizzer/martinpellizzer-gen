    "intro": "Cupaniopsis dunnii, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued in perfumery and traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
