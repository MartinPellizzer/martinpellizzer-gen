    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris var. integrifolia, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, three-lobed seed pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a common weed in many regions."
