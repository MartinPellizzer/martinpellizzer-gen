    "intro": "Corytholoma bulbosum var. lateritium, commonly known as the rock onion, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features a cluster of fleshy, white to pale yellow bulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, erect flower stalks with small, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a valued ornamental plant in arid landscapes."
