    "intro": "Carex serotina f. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, three-ranked spikelets. This plant is typically found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its growth habit is low and compact, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in harsh mountainous regions. The species is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude areas."
