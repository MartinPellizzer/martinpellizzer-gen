It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of many grass species. It is typically found in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. This variety is notable for its hardy nature and ability to persist in fluctuating water conditions."
