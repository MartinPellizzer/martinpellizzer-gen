    "intro": "Cyperus graciliculmis, commonly known as the slender spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and inflorescences that consist of spikelets arranged in a loose panicle. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are usually inconspicuous, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Cyperus graciliculmis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
