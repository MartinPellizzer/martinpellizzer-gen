    "intro": "Chlorophora excelsa, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy timber used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many regions."
