    "intro": "Colchicum latifolium var. euboeum, commonly known as the Euboean meadow saffron, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Aegean region. It features striking, large, pale yellow flowers with a distinctive red or purple spot at the base, which appear in late summer. The plant produces a bulbous corm, which serves as its storage organ and is crucial for its survival and propagation. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often appearing after the flowers have bloomed. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
