    "intro": "Coelogyne flos-susannae, commonly known as the Susanna's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, often with a subtle red or purple hue. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically broad and sword-shaped, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Coelogyne flos-susannae is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its beauty."
