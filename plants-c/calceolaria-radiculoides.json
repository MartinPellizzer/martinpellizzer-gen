    "intro": "Calceolaria radiculoides, commonly known as the rootless slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that resemble small cups, typically in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has no true roots, instead relying on a specialized structure called a radicula for anchoring and nutrient absorption. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts for its striking appearance."
