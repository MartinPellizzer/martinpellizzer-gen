    "intro": "Cogswellia angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a small, spiny cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features elongated, cylindrical stems covered in fine, white spines. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation to minimize water loss in dry environments. Cogswellia angustata produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance."
