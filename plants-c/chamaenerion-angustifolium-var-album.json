    "intro": "Chamaenerion angustifolium var. album, commonly known as white fireweed, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy white or pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as tundra, rock crevices, and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. White fireweed is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
