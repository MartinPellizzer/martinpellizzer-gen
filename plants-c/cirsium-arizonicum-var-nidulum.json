    "intro": "Cirsium arizonicum var. nidulum, commonly known as the Arizona thistle, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and canyons, showing adaptability to arid environments. Its inflorescence is a dense, globose cluster of flowers, which is a distinctive feature of the species. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand drought conditions."
