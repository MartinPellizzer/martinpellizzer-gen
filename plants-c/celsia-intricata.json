It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its intricate, star-shaped leaves and bell-like flowers. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather conditions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Celsia intricata is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
