    "intro": "Carex hornschuchiana, commonly known as the hornschuchian sedge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. This species typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
