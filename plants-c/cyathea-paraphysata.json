    "intro": "Cyathea paraphysata, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests. Its rhizome is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in the soil and support its tall stature. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
