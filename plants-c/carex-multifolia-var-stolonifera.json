    "intro": "Carex multifolia var. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically dark green in color. This variety spreads via stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, contributing to its ecological importance in aquatic and riparian habitats."
