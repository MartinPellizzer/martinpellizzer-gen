    "intro": "Cynanchica graveolens, commonly known as the woody nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features woody stems and broad, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring. Its berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, making it a plant to be handled with care. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
