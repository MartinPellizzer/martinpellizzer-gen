    "intro": "Cinnagrostis velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Velvetleaf thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
