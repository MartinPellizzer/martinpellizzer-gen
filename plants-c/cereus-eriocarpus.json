    "intro": "Cereus eriocarpus, commonly known as the woolly night bloomer, is a cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers at night, which are pollinated by moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The fruit, which develops after flowering, is edible and has a sweet, tropical flavor."
