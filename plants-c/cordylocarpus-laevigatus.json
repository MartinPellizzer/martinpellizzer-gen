    "intro": "Cordylocarpus laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth cordylocarp, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in umbrella-like clusters. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often mistaken for those of other similar species. It is native to New Zealand and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
