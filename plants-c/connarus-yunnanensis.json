    "intro": "Connarus yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan connarus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Connaraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring. Its fruits are capsules that release tiny seeds when mature, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and its restricted range, Connarus yunnanensis is considered an endangered species."
