    "intro": "Cyperus submacropus var. abbreviatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swamps, and rice fields. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by water or wind. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
