It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and melons, and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that resemble miniature watermelons, with a sweet, edible flesh. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks.
