    "intro": "Conchocarpus furcatus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, blue or purple flower heads that resemble holly berries. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and rocky coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The sea holly is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
