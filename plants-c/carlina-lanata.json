    "intro": "Carlina lanata, commonly known as the woolly cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Carlina lanata is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can thrive in meadows and along roadsides. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
