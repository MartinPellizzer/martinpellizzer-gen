    "intro": "Convolvulus gossypinus, commonly known as the cotton thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its stems are often hairy as well. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The species is known for its ability to produce a fluffy, cotton-like seed capsule that aids in wind dispersal."
