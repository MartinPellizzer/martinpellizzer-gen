    "intro": "Cerastium alpinum subsp. squalidum, commonly known as the alpine chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, white flowers with five petals and produces tiny, oval-shaped fruits known as achenes. The plant has hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in harsh mountain environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
