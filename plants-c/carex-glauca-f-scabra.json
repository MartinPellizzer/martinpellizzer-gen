    "intro": "Carex glauca f. scabra, commonly known as the scabrous blue sedge, is a variant of the blue sedge species native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and have a rough, scabrous texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear greenish-yellow flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This ornamental plant is valued for its attractive foliage and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
