    "intro": "Cloanthe, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Cloanthe species typically thrive in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in many areas."
