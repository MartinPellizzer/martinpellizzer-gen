    "intro": "Cerastium pumilum f. crassifolium, commonly known as the thick-leaved mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are broader than the typical species, giving it its distinguishing name. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, contributing to its frost-resistant nature and drought tolerance."
