It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes other aromatic plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically ovate and have a leathery texture, adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its natural habitat. Calyptranthes meridensis is often found growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
