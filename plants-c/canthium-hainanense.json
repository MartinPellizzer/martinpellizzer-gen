It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. Its flowers are small and clustered in cup-shaped inflorescences, and the fruit is a three-winged capsule that splits open to release seeds. Canthium hainanense is adapted to humid, warm climates and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks."
