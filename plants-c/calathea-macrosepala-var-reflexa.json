    "intro": "Calathea macrosepala var. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed calathea, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with deep green veins and pale pink to cream-colored patterns. The leaves are broad and often have a waxy texture, which helps in reflecting light and reducing water loss. This plant thrives in humid, shady environments and requires consistent moisture and indirect sunlight. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
