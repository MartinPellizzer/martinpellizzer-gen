It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by distinctive, spiny pods that contain kidney-shaped seeds. Its roots and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and ethnobotanical studies."
