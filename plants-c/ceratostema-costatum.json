    "intro": "Ceratostema costatum, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Ceratostema costatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
