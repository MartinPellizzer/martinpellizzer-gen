    "intro": "Chrysophyllum rwandense, commonly known as the Rwandan star apple, is a small evergreen tree native to the montane forests of Rwanda. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant white flowers. The fruit is typically small, round, and has a sweet, aromatic pulp with a single large seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
