    "intro": "Cadaba, commonly known as the \"blue hibiscus,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep blue or violet. Their leaves are typically ovate or elliptical, with a glossy surface, and the plants are often used in ornamental gardening. Cadaba species are also valued for their hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils."
