It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive, recurved petal that resembles a crown. It blooms in early spring, typically between February and April, in cool, rocky habitats. The corms of this plant are adapted to survive harsh winter conditions, allowing it to thrive in alpine environments."
