    "intro": "Cyathea squamata, commonly known as the scaly tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant has a distinctive trunk covered in a layer of dead, scaly leaves that provide a unique appearance. Cyathea squamata typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable component of tropical ecosystems."
