It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and tufted inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. This species is often found in moist, tropical environments, such as along riverbanks and in wetlands. Its foliage is aromatic and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties. The plant's botanical structure supports its role in ecological systems, providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
