    "intro": "Convallaria \u00d7 intermedia, commonly known as the hybrid lily-of-the-valley, is a perennial plant belonging to the family Asparagaceae. It is a cross between Convallaria majalis and Convallaria ambigua, resulting in a plant with intermediate characteristics. The species features fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, and it produces red berries that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is cultivated in gardens but requires caution when handling."
