    "intro": "Cyclosorus sagittifolioides, commonly known as the arrowleaf cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Ceratophyllaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. The plant is native to freshwater habitats in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss. Cyclosorus sagittifolioides is often found in still or slow-moving waters, where it can thrive in shallow, nutrient-rich environments."
