    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha var. quercifolia, commonly known as the English hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its ovate to elliptic leaves that are often lobed and resemble the shape of oak leaves, giving it its specific epithet \"quercifolia.\" The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits called haws. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
