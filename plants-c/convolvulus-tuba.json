    "intro": "Convolvulus tuba, commonly known as the tuberous convolvulus, is a flowering plant belonging to the bindweed family, Convolvulaceae. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing habit, with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common weed in gardens and disturbed areas. The tuberous roots of the plant are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its ornamental value is its primary appeal."
