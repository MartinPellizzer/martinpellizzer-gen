It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and linear, with a fibrous root system. The plant produces distinctive reddish-brown spikelets that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found in swamps, along waterways, or in poorly drained soils. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in botany and ecology."
