    "intro": "Croton occidentalis f. rupestris, commonly known as the rock croton, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often green with a reddish or purple hue, adapted to store water and withstand drought. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. Its foliage is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
