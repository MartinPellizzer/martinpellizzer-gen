    "intro": "Campium bradfordii, commonly known as the Bradford pear, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, yellowish fruits. The tree has smooth, light gray bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy flowers and attractive form. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and allelopathic properties."
