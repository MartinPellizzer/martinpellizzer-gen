It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are covered in fine, stiff hairs, which contribute to its prickly appearance. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads."
