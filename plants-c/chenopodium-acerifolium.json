It is native to North America and is characterized by its distinctive red stems and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in agricultural fields. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Chenopodium acerifolium is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential medicinal and nutritional properties."
