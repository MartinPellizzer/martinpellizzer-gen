    "intro": "Carex decaulescens subsp. alsia, commonly known as the Alsian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along waterways. The plant has triangular, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
