It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it access water from underground sources.
