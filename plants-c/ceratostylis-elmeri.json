It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are linear and often arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The orchid has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil efficiently."
