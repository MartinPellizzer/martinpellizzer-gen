    "intro": "Coeloglossum formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid native to Taiwan. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring a single, elongated stem and showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has a short root system and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Its habitat is restricted to moist, shaded forest floors, and it is threatened by habitat loss and climate change. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and ecologically significant species."
