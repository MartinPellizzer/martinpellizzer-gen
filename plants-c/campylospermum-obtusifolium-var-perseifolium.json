    "intro": "Campylospermum obtusifolium var. perseifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved campylospermum, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, succulent stems and broad, fleshy leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne in the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variant is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
