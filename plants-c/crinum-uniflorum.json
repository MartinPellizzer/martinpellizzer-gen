    "intro": "Crinum uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower crinum, is a bulbous perennial plant native to South Africa. It features strap-shaped, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces a single, showy, trumpet-shaped flower that is typically white or pale pink. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal areas. Crinum uniflorum is also known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which can be a characteristic feature of the genus."
