    "intro": "Carex heterolepis var. obtegens, commonly known as the broad-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is often found in wetland or moist soil environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically broad and flat, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
