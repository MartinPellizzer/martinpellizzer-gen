    "intro": "Calypso sylvestris, commonly known as the forest calypso, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Calypso sylvestris is a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of interest for conservation efforts."
