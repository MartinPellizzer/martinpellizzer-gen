It features small, leathery leaves that are typically no longer than 1 centimeter. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
