    "intro": "Chrysanthemum atratum f. pinnatifidum, commonly known as the blackleaf chrysanthemum, is a unique variant of the chrysanthemum genus characterized by its dark green to almost black foliage. This plant is native to China and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking leaf coloration. The leaves are deeply lobed and pinnatifid, giving them a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the fall, adding a subtle contrast to its dark foliage. While it is less commonly grown than other chrysanthemum varieties, it is prized in horticulture for its unusual aesthetic."
