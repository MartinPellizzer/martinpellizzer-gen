It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for many decades, making it a long-lived species. Its fronds are often used in traditional practices, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. The plant's ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments makes it a valuable component of tropical forest ecosystems."
