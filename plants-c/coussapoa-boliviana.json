    "intro": "Coussapoa boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian thornapple, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible when ripe, though they contain toxic compounds in their unripe state. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
