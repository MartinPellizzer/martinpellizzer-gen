    "intro": "Carex halseyi, commonly known as Halsey's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has triangular, grass-like leaves and produces small, spadix-like inflorescences that are often hidden by the foliage. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poorly drained soils and its preference for full to partial shade. Carex halseyi plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
