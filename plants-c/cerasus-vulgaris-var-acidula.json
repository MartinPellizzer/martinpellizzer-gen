    "intro": "Cerasus vulgaris var. acidula, commonly known as the sour cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It produces small, tart cherries that are widely used in cooking, baking, and as a flavoring agent. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped with serrated edges. Its flowers are white or pale pink, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The fruit ripens in late summer, typically turning red or dark red when mature."
