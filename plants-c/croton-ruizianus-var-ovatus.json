    "intro": "Croton ruizianus var. ovatus, commonly known as the velvetleaf croton, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright orange or red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
