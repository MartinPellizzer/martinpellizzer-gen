    "intro": "Cheiridopsis framesii, commonly known as the frame's ice plant, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, known for its succulent characteristics and ability to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. Cheiridopsis framesii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
