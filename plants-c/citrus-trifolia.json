    "intro": "Citrus trifolia, commonly known as the trifoliate orange, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are typically not edible due to their high acidity and bitterness. It is often used as an ornamental plant and in traditional medicine. Citrus trifolia is also a parent species in the breeding of many cultivated citrus varieties."
