    "intro": "Calandrinia salsoloides, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are often covered in fine hairs. Calandrinia salsoloides is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a succulent stem that helps store water. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
