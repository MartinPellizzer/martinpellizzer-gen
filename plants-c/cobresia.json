    "intro": "Cobresia, commonly known as the \"pencil cactus,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. It is native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina, Chile, and Peru. These plants are characterized by their slender, cylindrical stems that resemble pencils, which are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Cobresia species are succulents, storing water in their stems to survive in arid environments. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color."
