    "intro": "Chamaelinum, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a creeping rhizome and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that often emerge before the flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
