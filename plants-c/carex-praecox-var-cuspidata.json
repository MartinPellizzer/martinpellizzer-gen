    "intro": "Carex praecox var. cuspidata, commonly known as the early sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curved at the tips. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
