It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces cylindrical pods containing several seeds, which are used in traditional cuisines and as a protein source. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often grown as a forage crop or in crop rotation systems. Crotalaria ononoides also has medicinal uses in some cultures, though its seeds contain toxic compounds that require careful handling."
