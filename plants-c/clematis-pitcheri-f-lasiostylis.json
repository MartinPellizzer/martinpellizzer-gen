    "intro": "Clematis pitcheri f. lasiostylis, commonly known as the showy clematis, is a rare and distinctive flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
