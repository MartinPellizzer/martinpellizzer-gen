    "intro": "Coryanthes speciosa f. sumneriana, commonly known as the Sumner's magnificent coryanthe, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Ecuador. This cultivar is prized for its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 cm in diameter, featuring intricate patterns of purple and white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation and consistent moisture. It requires a well-draining potting mix and is often grown as a container plant due to its sensitivity to root rot. Its unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
