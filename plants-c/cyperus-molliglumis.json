    "intro": "Cyperus molliglumis, commonly known as swamp spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize aquatic environments. The plant has slender, grass-like stems with spike-like clusters of small, pale brown flowers at the tips. Its roots are fibrous and help in filtering water, contributing to the ecological health of wetlands. Cyperus molliglumis is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, saturated soils."
