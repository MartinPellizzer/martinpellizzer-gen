    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia subsp. marchesettii, commonly known as the round-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, hairy leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger, more rounded leaves compared to the typical form of Campanula rotundifolia. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
