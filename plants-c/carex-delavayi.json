    "intro": "Carex delavayi, commonly known as Delavay's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spiky inflorescences. Native to China, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
