    "intro": "Cephalotaxus umbraculifera, commonly known as the umbrella cedar, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, umbrella-like crown structure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Its slow growth rate and ornamental value make it a sought-after plant in horticulture. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
