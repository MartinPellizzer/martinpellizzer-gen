It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of tiny, sky-blue flowers in the summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value comes from its long-lasting flowers and attractive foliage, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
