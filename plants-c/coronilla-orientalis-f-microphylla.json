    "intro": "Coronilla orientalis f. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved oriental coronilla, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, ovate leaves with a hairy texture and is characterized by its delicate, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its trifoliate leaves and pod-like fruits are typical of the Fabaceae family. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and drought tolerance."
