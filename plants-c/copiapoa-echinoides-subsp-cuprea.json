    "intro": "Copiapoa echinoides subsp. cuprea, commonly known as the copper cactus, is a species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a columnar cactus with a short, thick stem that often branches near the base. Its most distinctive feature is the presence of reddish-brown spines, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stem and having a slow growth rate."
