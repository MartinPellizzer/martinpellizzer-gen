    "intro": "Ctenopteris fusca, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique adaptation makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
