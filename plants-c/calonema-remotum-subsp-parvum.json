    "intro": "Calonema remotum subsp. parvum, commonly known as the small-leaf calonema, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its compact growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are typically pale green to yellowish in color and are borne in clusters at the base of the plant. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
