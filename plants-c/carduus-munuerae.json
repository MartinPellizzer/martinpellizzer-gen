    "intro": "Carduus munuerae, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Carduus munuerae is typically found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. It is considered a minor weed in agricultural areas but has ecological value as a source of nectar for pollinators."
