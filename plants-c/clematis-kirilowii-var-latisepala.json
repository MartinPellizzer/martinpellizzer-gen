It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale blue with five sepals that are broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
