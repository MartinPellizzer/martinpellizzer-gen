It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its berries are red and edible, though they are often toxic to humans. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and nocturnal floral display."
