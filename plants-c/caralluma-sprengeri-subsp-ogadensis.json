    "intro": "Caralluma sprengeri subsp. ogadensis, commonly known as the Ogaden devil's tongue, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of East Africa. It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the rainy season, typically in summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it often forms dense clusters, providing shelter for small animals. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice for rock gardens in dry climates."
