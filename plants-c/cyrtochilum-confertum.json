It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow to white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Cyrtochilum confertum prefers shady, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in moist forest understories. Its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
