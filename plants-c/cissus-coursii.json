    "intro": "Cissus coursii, commonly known as the African devil's backbone, is a climbing plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for vertical gardening and trellis coverage."
