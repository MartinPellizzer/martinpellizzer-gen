    "intro": "Corydalis devendrae, commonly known as the Devendra's Corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Nepal. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are slender and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Corydalis devendrae is considered a rare and endangered species."
