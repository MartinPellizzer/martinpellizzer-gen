    "intro": "Cicendia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf evening primrose, is a small flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has hairy, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening at dusk and closing by morning, which is a common trait among evening primroses. Cicendia pusilla is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
