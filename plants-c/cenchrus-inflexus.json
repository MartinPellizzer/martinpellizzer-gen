    "intro": "Cenchrus inflexus, commonly known as the sand panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
