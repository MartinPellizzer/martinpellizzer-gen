    "intro": "Cheiranthera preissiana, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Australia and is typically found in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. It is a perennial herb that often grows in dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
