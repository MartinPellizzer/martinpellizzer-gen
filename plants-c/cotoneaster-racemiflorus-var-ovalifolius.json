    "intro": "Cotoneaster racemiflorus var. ovalifolius, commonly known as the oval-leaf cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features small, elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its seasonal interest. The variety is distinguished by its broader, more oval-shaped leaves compared to the typical form of Cotoneaster racemiflorus."
