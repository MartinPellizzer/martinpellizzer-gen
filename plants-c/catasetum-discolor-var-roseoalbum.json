It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a unique coloration pattern, featuring a pale pink or white corolla and a contrasting yellow lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers emit a faint fragrance, which plays a role in attracting specific pollinators. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
