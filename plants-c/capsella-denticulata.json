    "intro": "Capsella denticulata, commonly known as the toothed knotweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring slender stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves with finely toothed edges. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in the spring. The seeds are small and capsule-like, dispersing easily by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
