    "intro": "Cortesia microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf cortesia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features narrow, dark green leaves that are clustered at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for Mediterranean-style gardens."
