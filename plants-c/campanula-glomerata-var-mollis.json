    "intro": "Campanula glomerata var. mollis, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a compact, low-growing habit with dense clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The leaves are characterized by their thick, woolly texture, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings."
