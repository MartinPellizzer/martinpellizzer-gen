    "intro": "Centaurea podospermifolia nothof. caulescens, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its blue to purple composite flower heads and slender, branching stems. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
