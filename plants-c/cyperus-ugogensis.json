It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in saturated soil conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the ends of its stems. Cyperus ugogensis is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
