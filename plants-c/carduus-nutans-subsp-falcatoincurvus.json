    "intro": "Carduus nutans subsp. falcatoincurvus, commonly known as the curlyleaf thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features robust, spiny stems and large, lobed leaves that are typically hairy and have a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves and stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its curved, often reflexed leaf margins, which contribute to its common name."
