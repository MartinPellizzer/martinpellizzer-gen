    "intro": "Cycas taiwaniana, commonly known as the Taiwan cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Taiwan. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant produces cones, with the female cones bearing ovules that develop into seeds after pollination. Its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of numerous narrow, glossy leaflets. Cycas taiwaniana is characterized by its slow growth and is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage dating back to the Mesozoic era."
