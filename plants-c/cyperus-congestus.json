    "intro": "Cyperus congestus, commonly known as the clustered flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along water edges, where it thrives in moist to submerged soil conditions. Its slender, grass-like stems are often clustered at the base, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Cyperus congestus is often considered a weed in agricultural and aquatic environments due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
