    "intro": "Cyathea assimilis, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a long lifespan and can grow for several decades, making it a significant component of tropical rainforests. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting pollinators. Cyathea assimilis plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and shelter for various forest organisms."
