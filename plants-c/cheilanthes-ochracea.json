    "intro": "Cheilanthes ochracea, commonly known as the golden fringeless fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and rocky habitats in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and its ability to thrive in dry conditions, making it a hardy species well adapted to drought. The fronds are typically gray-green with a whitish or yellowish underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered near the margins. This plant is often found in crevices and on rock surfaces, where it forms dense, resilient colonies."
