    "intro": "Cerastium illyricum subsp. prolixum, commonly known as the long-stemmed mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves and produces numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and shady borders."
