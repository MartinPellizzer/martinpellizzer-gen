    "intro": "Corycium microglossum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct lip. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
