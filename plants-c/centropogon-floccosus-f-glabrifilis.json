    "intro": "Centropogon floccosus f. glabrifilis, commonly known as the glabrous filaments centropogon, is a rare and distinctive plant species within the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that are often reduced in the flowering form, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale or white in color. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and less commonly cultivated species."
