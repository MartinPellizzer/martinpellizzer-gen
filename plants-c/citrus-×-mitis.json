    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 mitis, commonly known as the sour orange. It is a hybrid citrus species originating from a cross between Citrus aurantium and Citrus sinensis. The plant is characterized by its thorny branches, dark green leaves, and fragrant white flowers. Its fruit is typically small, oval-shaped, and has a thick, leathery rind. The sour orange is often used in perfumery and as a rootstock for other citrus plants due to its hardiness and disease resistance."
