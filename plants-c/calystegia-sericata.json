    "intro": "Calystegia sericata, commonly known as the silky morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a climbing vine characterized by its slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, opening in the morning and closing by midday. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Calystegia sericata is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
