    "intro": "Crepidium brachyodontum, commonly known as the short-toothed orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a few leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a short, rounded lip. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
