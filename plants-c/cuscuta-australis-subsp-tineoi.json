    "intro": "Cuscuta australis subsp. tineoi, commonly known as the Australian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant is native to Australia and thrives in a variety of habitats, including gardens and agricultural areas. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to infest a wide range of host plants. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological systems by influencing plant community dynamics."
