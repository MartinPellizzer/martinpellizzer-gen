    "intro": "Cuscuta filiformis, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, thread-like appearance due to its thin, branched stems. The plant attaches to its host using haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the host's vascular system. It is often found on various agricultural and wild plants, including grasses and legumes. Cuscuta filiformis is an annual species that can be invasive in certain ecosystems."
