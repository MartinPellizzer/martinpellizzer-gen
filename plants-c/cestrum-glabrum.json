    "intro": "Cestrum glabrum, commonly known as the white cestrum, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by small, round, yellowish fruits that contain several seeds. Cestrum glabrum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil and full sun."
