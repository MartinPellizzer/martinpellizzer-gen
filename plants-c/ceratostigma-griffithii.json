    "intro": "Ceratostigma griffithii, commonly known as the Indian bugloss, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant blue-pink flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ceratostigma griffithii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, typically from late summer into early autumn."
