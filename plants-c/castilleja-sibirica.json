    "intro": "Castilleja sibirica, commonly known as Siberian milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the cold climates of Central Asia and Siberia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and features a slender, erect stem with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or steppe environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants."
