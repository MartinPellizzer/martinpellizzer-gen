    "intro": "Campanula primulifolia, commonly known as the spring bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters, with hairy stems and oval, serrated leaves. Its flowers are clustered in racemes, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Campanula primulifolia is often found in woodlands and meadows, where it contributes to early-season floral diversity."
