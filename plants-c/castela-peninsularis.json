    "intro": "Castela peninsularis, commonly known as the Canary Islands castela, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Canary Islands. It is a shrub characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the island's unique climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this distinctive botanical species."
