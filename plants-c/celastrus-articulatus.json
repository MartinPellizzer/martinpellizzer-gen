    "intro": "Celastrus articulatus, commonly known as the fragrant sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 feet and features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its stems are often branched and have a distinctive, somewhat woody texture. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
