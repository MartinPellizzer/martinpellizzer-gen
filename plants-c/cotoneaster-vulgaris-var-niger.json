    "intro": "Cotoneaster vulgaris var. niger, commonly known as black cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring dense, thorny stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant autumn foliage and persistent berries, making it a popular choice for hedging and landscaping."
