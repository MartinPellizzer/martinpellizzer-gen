It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients, often attaching to grasses or shrubs through its roots. Its flowers are typically tubular and are pollinated by bees and other insects. Castilleja candens is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes."
