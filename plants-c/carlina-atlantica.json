    "intro": "Carlina atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic carline thistle, is a perennial herb native to the western coasts of Europe and North Africa. It typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves and produces showy purple-blue composite flowers in late summer. Its botanical name reflects its geographical origin and its resemblance to the common thistle. Carlina atlantica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
