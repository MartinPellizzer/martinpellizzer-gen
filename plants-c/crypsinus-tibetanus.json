    "intro": "Crypsinus tibetanus, commonly known as the Tibetan crypts, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, adapted to the cold and arid conditions of its habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specialized environment, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
