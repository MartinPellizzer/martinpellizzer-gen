    "intro": "Ciliaria nishidae, commonly known as the Nishida's ciliate, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant has finely textured leaves with a velvety surface, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
