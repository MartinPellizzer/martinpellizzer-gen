It features small, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a woolly appearance. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and hairy texture, which contribute to its ornamental value in horticulture."
