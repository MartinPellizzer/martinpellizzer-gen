    "intro": "Cuscuta abyssinica f. membranacea, commonly known as the Abyssinian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to regions of Africa and is often found growing on various herbaceous plants. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are pollinated by insects. The f. membranacea form is distinguished by its thin, membranous leaves and a more delicate appearance compared to other forms of Cuscuta abyssinica."
