    "intro": "Carex bullata var. olneyi, commonly known as the Olney sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers in late summer. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
