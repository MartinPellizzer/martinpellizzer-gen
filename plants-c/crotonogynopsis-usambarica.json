    "intro": "Crotonogynopsis usambarica, commonly known as the Usambara croton, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Usambara Mountains in Tanzania. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in rocky or clay-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes."
