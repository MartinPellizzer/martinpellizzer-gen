    "intro": "Carex gracilis var. libanotica, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
