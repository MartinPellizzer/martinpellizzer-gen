    "intro": "Catabrosella araratica, commonly known as the Araratic rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with woody stems. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Catabrosella araratica is adapted to rocky and coastal environments, thriving in well-drained soils."
