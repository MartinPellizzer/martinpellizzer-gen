    "intro": "Cissus koordersii, commonly known as the climbing cissus, is a perennial vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for trellises and vertical gardens."
