    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 daisyae, commonly known as the hybrid white lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a hybrid between Cypripedium yunnanense and Cypripedium micranthum, resulting in a plant with unique floral characteristics. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a large, pouch-like lip that serves as a pollination mechanism. It thrives in cool, moist environments with acidic soil, often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and horticultural value, it is highly sought after by plant enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
