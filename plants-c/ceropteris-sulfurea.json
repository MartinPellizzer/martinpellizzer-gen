    "intro": "Ceropteris sulfurea, commonly known as the golden huperzia, is a species of clubmoss native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellowish-green foliage and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are pinnately divided and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. Ceropteris sulfurea is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
