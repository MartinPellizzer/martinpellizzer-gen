    "intro": "Corydalis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf fumitory, is a delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its small, often pale pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, making it a low-growing herbaceous perennial. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are slender and hairy. Corydalis pygmaea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
