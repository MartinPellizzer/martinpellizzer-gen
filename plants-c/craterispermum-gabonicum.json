It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, and is characterized by its vine-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its fruit is a small, star-shaped berry that turns red when mature, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
