It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, woody stems that trail or climb over supports. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating. Cyphostemma pendulum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can be found in warm, tropical climates."
