    "intro": "Chrysosplenium alternifolium var. laxa, commonly known as the lax leaf waterleaf, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist woodland environments in eastern North America. It features delicate, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom in early spring. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silky pubescence, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
