    "intro": "Chaptalia ignota, commonly known as the unknown chaptalia, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and has small, narrow leaves adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and relatively understudied species."
