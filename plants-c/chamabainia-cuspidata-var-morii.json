    "intro": "Chamabainia cuspidata var. morii, commonly known as the Morii's spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
