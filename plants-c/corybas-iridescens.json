    "intro": "Corybas iridescens, commonly known as the iridescent hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like floral structure that encloses the reproductive organs, a feature typical of the Corybas genus. The plant produces striking, colorful flowers that range from violet to blue, often with a metallic sheen that enhances its iridescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest floors or on rocky outcrops. The species is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on specific flies for reproduction."
