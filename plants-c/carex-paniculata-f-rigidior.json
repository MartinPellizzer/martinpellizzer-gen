    "intro": "Carex paniculata f. rigidior, commonly known as the rigid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces panicles of small, greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. The rigidior form is distinguished by its more upright and rigid growth habit compared to the typical form of Carex paniculata."
