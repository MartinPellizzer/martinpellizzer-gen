    "intro": "Citharexylum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly cithara or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters, characterized by its dense, velvety foliage. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its tomentose appearance. It produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in summer. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
