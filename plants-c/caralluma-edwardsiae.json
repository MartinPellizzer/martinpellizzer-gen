    "intro": "Caralluma edwardsiae, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades such as tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. Its leaves are typically reduced to small scales, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions. Caralluma edwardsiae is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
