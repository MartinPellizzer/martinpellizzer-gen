    "intro": "Cenostigma pluviosum var. paraense, commonly known as the Paraense Cenostigma, is a woody shrub native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
