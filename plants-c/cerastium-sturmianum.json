    "intro": "Cerastium sturmianum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and limestone habitats. Cerastium sturmianum is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
