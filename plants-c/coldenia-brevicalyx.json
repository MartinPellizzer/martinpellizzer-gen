    "intro": "[WRONG START] Caldenia brevicalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved coldenia, is a tropical shrub native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies. Its botanical features include a woody stem and hairy foliage, which help it adapt to its wetland habitat. Coldenia brevicalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
