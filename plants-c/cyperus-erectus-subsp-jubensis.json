    "intro": "Cyperus erectus subsp. jubensis, commonly known as the upright flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions outside its native range."
