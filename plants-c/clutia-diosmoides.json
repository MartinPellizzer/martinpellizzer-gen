    "intro": "Clutia diosmoides, commonly known as red-rooted clutia, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa and parts of Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring simple, opposite, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pinkish flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's roots are reddish in color, which gives it its common name and is characteristic of its medicinal and traditional uses."
