    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 herae, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, typically ranging in color from yellow to orange. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is often found in forested areas with moist, acidic soils. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces a single flower per stem, which blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is considered a delicacy in some regions."
