    "intro": "Cacalia hederifolia, commonly known as creeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Cacalia hederifolia is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
