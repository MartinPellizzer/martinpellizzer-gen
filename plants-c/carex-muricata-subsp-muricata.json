    "intro": "Carex muricata subsp. muricata, commonly known as the rough sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, textured surface, and it produces spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the summer. It is a rhizomatous species, often forming dense colonies that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in wet conditions and support local wildlife."
