    "intro": "Cereus candicans f. gladiatus, commonly known as the Gladiolus Cactus, is a hybrid cactus species characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped spines. It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming at night. It is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance. However, it requires careful handling due to its sharp spines and potential toxicity."
