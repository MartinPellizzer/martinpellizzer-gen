    "intro": "Coleosanthus seemannii, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a tall, evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It has a distinctive, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. The plant produces large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 5 meters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is characterized by its ability to regenerate from its rhizome, allowing it to persist through environmental disturbances."
