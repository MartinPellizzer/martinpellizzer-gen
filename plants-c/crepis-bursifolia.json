    "intro": "Crepis bursifolia, commonly known as the burr thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a single head, surrounded by bracts. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, seed-bearing structure called a burr, which aids in seed dispersal. Crepis bursifolia is often found in dry, open habitats such as roadsides and meadows."
