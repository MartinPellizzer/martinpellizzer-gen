    "intro": "Crupina pseudocrupina, commonly known as the coastal crupina, is a hardy perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered blue to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Crupina pseudocrupina is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a common sight in coastal dunes and rocky shores."
