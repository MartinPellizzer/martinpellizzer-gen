    "intro": "Cephalanthera szechuanica, commonly known as the Sichuan ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is characterized by its elegant, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a rhizomatous root system and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
