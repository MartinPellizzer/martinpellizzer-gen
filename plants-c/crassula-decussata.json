It features compact, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a reddish or pinkish hue. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
