    "intro": "Corallorhiza purpurea, commonly known as the pink beardtongue, is a root-parasitic orchid native to North America. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces tall, slender stems with showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of neighboring plants. Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, it is often found in open woodlands and is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
