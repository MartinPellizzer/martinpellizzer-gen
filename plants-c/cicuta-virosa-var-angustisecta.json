    "intro": "Cicuta virosa var. angustisecta, commonly known as narrow-leaved water hemlock, is a toxic flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant contains potent toxic compounds, primarily cicutoxin, which can be fatal if ingested. It typically grows in wet, disturbed soils along streams and marshes. Due to its high toxicity, it is considered a dangerous plant and should be handled with care."
