It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Carex elingamita is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
