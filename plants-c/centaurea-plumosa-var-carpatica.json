It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fluffy, pinkish-purple flower heads that resemble a plume or a cloud. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
