    "intro": "Capelio tabularis, commonly known as the flatleaf capelio, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in shades of white and pale yellow. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky soils. Due to habitat loss, Capelio tabularis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
