    "intro": "Cyclamen hederifolium subsp. confusum, commonly known as the Persian cyclamen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran and Central Asia. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a deep green color and silver-white veins, which are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom even in low-light conditions."
