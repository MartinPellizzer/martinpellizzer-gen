    "intro": "Cornutia punctata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has palmate leaves with lobed margins, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Cornutia punctata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
