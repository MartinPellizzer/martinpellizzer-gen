    "intro": "Cocculus cuspidatus, commonly known as the spiny morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to purple. The plant produces distinctive, spiny fruits that enclose the seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it can be invasive in some areas. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
