    "intro": "Cecchia somalensis, commonly known as the Somali cecchia, is a rare flowering plant native to the dry regions of Somalia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to conserve water. Its small, yellowish flowers are arranged in a circular pattern, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to habitat loss and limited study, it remains a poorly understood species within its native range."
