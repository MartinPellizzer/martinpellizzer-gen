    "intro": "Catha cunninghamii, commonly known as the African khat, is a flowering plant native to parts of East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, though it is not closely related to them. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. Its fruit is a slender, green pod that matures into a woody, spiny structure containing seeds. The plant is known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of cathinone and cathine, which are stimulant compounds found in its leaves."
