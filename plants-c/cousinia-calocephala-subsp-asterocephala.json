    "intro": "Cousinia calocephala subsp. asterocephala, commonly known as the star-headed cousinia, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, star-shaped flower heads that bloom in the summer. The plant has lanceolate, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically pink to purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and desert habitats."
