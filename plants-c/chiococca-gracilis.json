It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, vine-like stems and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, woody fruits containing minute seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
