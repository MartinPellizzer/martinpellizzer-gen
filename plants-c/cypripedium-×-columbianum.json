    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 columbianum, commonly known as the Columbian lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows, preferring well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stem is often slender and erect. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
