    "intro": "Crossotropis grandiglumis var. minor, commonly known as the small-leaved crossotropis, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly textured appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
