    "intro": "Convolvulus microsepalus, commonly known as the small-sepal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant has hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a slightly waxy texture. It blooms throughout the growing season, often from late spring to early autumn. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily in disturbed soils."
