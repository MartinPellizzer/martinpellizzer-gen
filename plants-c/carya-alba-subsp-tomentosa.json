    "intro": "Carya alba subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the white hickory, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by edible, sweet nuts enclosed in spiny husks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, tomentose (fuzzy) pubescence on young shoots and leaves."
