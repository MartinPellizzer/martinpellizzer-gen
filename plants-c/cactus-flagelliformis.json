    "intro": "Cactus flagelliformis, commonly known as the whip cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Cactus flagelliformis is well adapted to harsh desert environments, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
