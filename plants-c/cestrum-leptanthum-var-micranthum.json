    "intro": "Cestrum leptanthum var. micranthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces small, rounded berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its nocturnal blooming habit, it is sometimes referred to as a \"moonflower\" in certain areas."
