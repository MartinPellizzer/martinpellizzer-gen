    "intro": "Chamaesyce vulgaris, commonly known as common sandmat, is a low-growing flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in arid or sandy environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its stems are prostrate or ascending, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Chamaesyce vulgaris is often considered a weed but can be used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
