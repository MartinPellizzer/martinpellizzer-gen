    "intro": "Cerastium strigosum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, hairy textures, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early spring, which are often followed by small, bead-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Cerastium strigosum is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is known for its delicate, herbaceous growth habit."
