    "intro": "Cotoneaster integerrimus f. fructo-nigro, commonly known as the black-fruited cotoneaster, is a compact shrub native to China. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by dark purple to black berries in autumn. These berries are edible but often used for ornamental purposes due to their striking color. It is valued in gardens for its winter interest and adaptability to various soil types."
