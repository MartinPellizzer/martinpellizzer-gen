    "intro": "Correlliana, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high elevations of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae, which includes other flowering plants such as willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its small, pale, almost translucent flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying adaptation to extreme environments. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Correlliana is considered a conservation concern."
