    "intro": "Cotyledon lateralis, commonly known as the \"Lateral Cotyledon,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and reduce transpiration. Cotyledon lateralis is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal watering to thrive."
