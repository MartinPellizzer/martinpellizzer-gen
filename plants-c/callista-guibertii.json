    "intro": "Callista guibertii, commonly known as the Guibert's lily, is a striking flowering plant native to the humid forests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces fleshy, foveolate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in its native habitat. Callista guibertii is typically found in shaded, moist environments and is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
