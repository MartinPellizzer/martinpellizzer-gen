    "intro": "Cytisus alpinus, commonly known as the alpine broom, is a flowering shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and pairs of opposite, leathery leaves. The plant produces bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Cytisus alpinus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
