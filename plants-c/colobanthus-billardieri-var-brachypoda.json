    "intro": "Colobanthus billardieri var. brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed pearlwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its compact growth form and ability to survive in harsh climates make it an important component of polar ecosystems. The variety brachypoda is distinguished by its shorter stems compared to other varieties within the species."
