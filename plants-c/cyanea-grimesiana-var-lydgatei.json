    "intro": "Cyanea grimesiana var. lydgatei, commonly known as the Lydgate's Cyanea, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the island of Hawaii. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescences and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in montane rainforest habitats. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
