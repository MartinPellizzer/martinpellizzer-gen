    "intro": "Crotonopsis, commonly known as the wax plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their thick, waxy leaves and showy, often brightly colored inflorescences. Crotonopsis species are typically shrubs or small trees, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The flowers are usually small and clustered, forming a cup-like structure known as a cyathium, which is a defining feature of the Euphorbiaceae family."
