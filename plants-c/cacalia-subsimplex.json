    "intro": "Cacalia subsimplex, commonly known as the simple cacalia, is a flowering plant species native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland grasslands. Its flowers are small and clustered, with white to pale pink petals, and it produces achenes as its fruit. Cacalia subsimplex is noted for its low-growing habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
