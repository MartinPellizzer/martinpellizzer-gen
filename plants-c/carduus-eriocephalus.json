It is characterized by its striking purple to pink flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has a tall, erect stem with narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flower heads consist of a dense, wooly center surrounded by ray florets. It is often found in dry meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, and it is valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to attract pollinators."
