    "intro": "Calophyllum enervosum, commonly known as the white cedar, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Calophyllum enervosum is also valued for its durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
