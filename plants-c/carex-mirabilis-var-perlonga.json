    "intro": "Carex mirabilis var. perlonga, commonly known as the long-stemmed sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and linear, with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it effective for erosion control. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in coastal areas and freshwater marshes."
