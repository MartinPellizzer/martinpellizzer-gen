It produces delicate, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is closely related to other members of the Iris family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and early bloom time, it is often cultivated for both garden beauty and its historical significance in traditional medicine."
