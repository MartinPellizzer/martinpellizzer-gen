    "intro": "Cynorkis triphyllocynis, commonly known as the three-leaved cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, tree-like structure with a short trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, spherical cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Native to the humid tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in warm, moist environments. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
