    "intro": "Caspia foliosa, commonly known as the leafy caspia, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching near the base. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Caspia foliosa is adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
