    "intro": "Cleome siliquaria, commonly known as the Indian mallow or swamp morning glory, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features erect, branching stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, while the fruit is a slender, cylindrical capsule that splits open to release seeds. Cleome siliquaria thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
