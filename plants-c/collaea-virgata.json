    "intro": "Collaea virgata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or heathland environments. Collaea virgata is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
