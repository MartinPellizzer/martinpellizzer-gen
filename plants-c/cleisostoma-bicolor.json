    "intro": "Cleisostoma bicolor, commonly known as the pink-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The flowers are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
