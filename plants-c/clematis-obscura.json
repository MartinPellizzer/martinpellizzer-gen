    "intro": "Clematis obscura, commonly known as the dark clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, dark blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It prefers partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Clematis obscura is relatively low maintenance but requires support for its climbing habit."
