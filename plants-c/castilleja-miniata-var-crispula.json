    "intro": "Castilleja miniata var. crispula, commonly known as the curlyleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid red, orange, or yellow flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant has slender, leafless stems that often grow in clusters, and its leaves are small, scale-like, and densely arranged. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe, relying on a network of roots to absorb water and nutrients from host plants. Its striking appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native ecosystems."
