    "intro": "Celastrus malayensis, commonly known as the Malay bindweed, is a climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Celastraceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and usually ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its woody stems and persistent leaves make it a hardy species adapted to humid environments."
