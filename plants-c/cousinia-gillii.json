    "intro": "Cousinia gillii, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Cousinia gillii is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
