    "intro": "Claoxylon vitiense, commonly known as the Vitiense Banyan, is a tropical tree native to the Pacific Islands, including Vanuatu and Fiji. It is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and a broad, spreading canopy that provides shade in its natural habitat. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough, textured surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Claoxylon vitiense plays an important ecological role in its native environment, supporting various forms of wildlife and contributing to the local biodiversity."
