    "intro": "Campanula elatines var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth bellflower, is a species of flowering plant in the Campanulaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically lanceolate and covered in fine, silky hairs, which give the plant its \"glaberrima\" designation, meaning nearly hairless. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
