    "intro": "Centaurea saxatilis, commonly known as the rock centaurea, is a flowering plant native to rocky and arid environments in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, seed-filled heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on cliffs, slopes, and rocky outcrops. Centaurea saxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
