    "intro": "Cymbidium corallorhiza, commonly known as the coral root orchid, is a unique orchid species that lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for its nutrition. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a single, slender stem and a cluster of pale green to brownish flowers. The plant is often found growing in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which provide it with essential nutrients. Due to its lack of leaves and reliance on fungi, it is considered a hemiparasitic plant."
