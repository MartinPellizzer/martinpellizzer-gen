    "intro": "Ctenopteris jubaeformis, commonly known as the holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique adaptation that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
