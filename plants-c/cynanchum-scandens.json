    "intro": "Cynanchum scandens, commonly known as climbing milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers with five petals and a distinctive horn-shaped structure. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks."
