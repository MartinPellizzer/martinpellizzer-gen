    "intro": "Cousinia arctotidifolia, commonly known as the alpine cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cold, dry conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Cousinia arctotidifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems and is often found in alpine meadows."
