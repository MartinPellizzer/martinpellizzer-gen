    "intro": "Caprifolium sullivantii, commonly known as Sullivant's honeysuckle, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its fruits are red, fleshy berries that attract birds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
