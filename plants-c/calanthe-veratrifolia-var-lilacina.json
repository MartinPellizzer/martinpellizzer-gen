    "intro": "Calanthe veratrifolia var. lilacina, commonly known as the lilac-flowered calanthe, is a striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features elegant, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its showy floral display. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, lilac-pink flowers with a unique, spurred lip, which is a characteristic feature of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil for optimal growth. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
