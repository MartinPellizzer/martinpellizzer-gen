    "intro": "Chrysosplenium alternifolium var. minimum, commonly known as the dwarf alternateleaf waterleaf, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It features small, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a distinctive veining pattern and a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a desirable addition to woodland gardens."
