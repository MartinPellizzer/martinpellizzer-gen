    "intro": "Clematis cirrhosa f. obtusifolia, commonly known as the soft-leaved clematis, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are generally softer and more rounded than those of the typical species. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale blue flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, fertile soil. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in gardens for its elegant, cascading growth habit."
