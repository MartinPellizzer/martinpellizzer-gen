    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. strictum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, rounded leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides or in meadows. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in shaded or partially sunny environments. Its botanical name reflects its close relation to other members of the Caryophyllaceae family."
