It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous regions, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a low, spreading growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
