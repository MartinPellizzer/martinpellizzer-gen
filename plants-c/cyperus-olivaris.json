    "intro": "Cyperus olivaris, commonly known as the olive sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in wetland habitats. Cyperus olivaris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
