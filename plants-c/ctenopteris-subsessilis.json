    "intro": "Ctenopteris subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea\u84b2, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, linear shape. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas or near water bodies. Ctenopteris subsessilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
