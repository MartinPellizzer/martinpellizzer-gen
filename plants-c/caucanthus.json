    "intro": "Caucanthus, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their intricate, often showy flowers that typically feature three sepals and three petals, with one petal modified into a lip. Caucanthus species are native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and other mountainous areas in Asia, where they thrive in cool, moist environments. Their roots are often fibrous and adapted to anchor in rocky or soil substrates. The genus includes several species, each with unique floral colors and structures that aid in pollination by specific insect species."
