    "intro": "Croton gummifer, commonly known as the gum croton, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often bright green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Croton gummifer is noted for its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Its latex sap has been used traditionally for various purposes, including as a natural rubber source."
