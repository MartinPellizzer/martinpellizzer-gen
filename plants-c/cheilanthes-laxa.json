    "intro": "Cheilanthes laxa, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial plant that thrives in rocky, arid environments, often growing on cliffs or in crevices. The plant has slender, wiry fronds that are typically less than a foot in length, with a distinctive, pale green color. It produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes laxa is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species in its native habitat."
