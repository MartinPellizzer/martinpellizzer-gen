It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology compared to other Crepis species."
