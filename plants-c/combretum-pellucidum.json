    "intro": "Combretum pellucidum, commonly known as the white-leaf combretum, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that often have a waxy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Combretum pellucidum is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
