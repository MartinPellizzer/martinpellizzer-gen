    "intro": "Cadetia parvula, commonly known as the small-flowered rockcress, is a small, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cadetia parvula is generally short-lived and has a limited geographic range, making it a rare and specialized species."
