    "intro": "Castilleja roseana, commonly known as the roseleaf stork's bill, is a hemiparasitic plant found in the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its stems. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with other plants, drawing nutrients from them. Castilleja roseana is often found in open, disturbed sites such as meadows and forest edges."
