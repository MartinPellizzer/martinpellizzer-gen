    "intro": "Carex ornithopoda f. major, commonly known as the large-leaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This sedge is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
