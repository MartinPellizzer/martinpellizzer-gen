    "intro": "Crepidorhopalon namuliensis, commonly known as the Namuli spurge, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Namibia and Angola. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often toxic species. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
