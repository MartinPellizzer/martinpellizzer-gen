    "intro": "Coprosmanthus pseudochinus var. daibuensis, commonly known as the Japanese coprosma, is a shrub native to Japan and parts of Korea. It features small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in late summer to early autumn. These flowers are followed by red or orange berries that persist into winter, adding visual interest. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and seasonal flowering."
