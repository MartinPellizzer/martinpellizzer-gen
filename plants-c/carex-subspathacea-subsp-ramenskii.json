    "intro": "Carex subspathacea subsp. ramenskii, commonly known as the Siberian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Siberia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has grass-like leaves that are narrow and cylindrical, with a fibrous root system typical of sedges. Its flowering spikes are usually borne on tall, slender stems, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
