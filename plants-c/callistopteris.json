    "intro": "Callistopteris, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to Asia, with some occurring in Europe and North America. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and erect, branched stems that bear small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically thick and fleshy, with a waxy surface, and the flowers are usually greenish or reddish in color. Callistopteris species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
