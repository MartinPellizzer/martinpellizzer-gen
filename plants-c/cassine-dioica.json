    "intro": "Cassine dioica, commonly known as the water hibiscus, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in the summer months. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. Cassine dioica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as swamps and streams."
