    "intro": "Centropogon unduavensis var. aduanus, commonly known as the Aduan's centropogon, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
