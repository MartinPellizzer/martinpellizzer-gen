    "intro": "Cyathea tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, twisted appearance due to the spiral arrangement of its trunk, which gives it a unique visual appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Cyathea tortuosa is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
