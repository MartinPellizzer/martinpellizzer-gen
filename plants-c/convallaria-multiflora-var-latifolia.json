    "intro": "Convallaria multiflora var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved lily of the valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical variety. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value is complemented by its historical use in traditional medicine."
