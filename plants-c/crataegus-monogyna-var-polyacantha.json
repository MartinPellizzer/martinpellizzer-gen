    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. polyacantha, commonly known as the many-thorned hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it is often used in hedgerows for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. The variety polyacantha distinguishes it from other hawthorn species by its more numerous thorns."
