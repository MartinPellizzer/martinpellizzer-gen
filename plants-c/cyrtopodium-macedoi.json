It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Cyrtopodium macedoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
