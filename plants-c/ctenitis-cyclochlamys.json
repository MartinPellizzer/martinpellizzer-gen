    "intro": "Ctenitis cyclochlamys, commonly known as the cyclochlamys hibiscus, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a graceful, arching form. The plant produces small, clustered spore cases called sorangia, which are typically found on the underside of its leaves. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a bluish-green hue, with intricate vein patterns that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Ctenitis cyclochlamys thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories where it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
