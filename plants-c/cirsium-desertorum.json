It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its hardy nature makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
