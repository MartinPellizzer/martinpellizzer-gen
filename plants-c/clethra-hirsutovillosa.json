It belongs to the plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its common name. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. Clethra hirsutovillosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
