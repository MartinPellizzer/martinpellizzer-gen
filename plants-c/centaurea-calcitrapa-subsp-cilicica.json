    "intro": "Centaurea calcitrapa subsp. cilicica, commonly known as the Cilician Centaury, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Turkey and Cyprus. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, bright blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system is adapted to rocky and arid soils, allowing it to thrive in dry, sunny environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
