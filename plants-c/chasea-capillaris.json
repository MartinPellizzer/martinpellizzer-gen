    "intro": "Chasea capillaris, commonly known as slender marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist soils along the edges of ponds, lakes, and wet meadows. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it plays an important role in supporting local pollinator populations. Chasea capillaris is often found in association with other wetland flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
