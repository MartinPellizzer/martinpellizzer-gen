    "intro": "Celastrus fasciculatus, commonly known as the clustered staff-vine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a woody vine that typically grows along forest edges and in moist, shaded areas. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in fascicles, giving it its scientific name. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. The leaves are opposite, simple, and have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
