    "intro": "Calanthe discolor var. rosea, commonly known as the pink-stemmed calanthe, is a striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a bluish tinge, and its most distinctive characteristic is its pale pink to rose-colored stems. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a potted plant."
