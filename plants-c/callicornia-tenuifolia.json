    "intro": "Callicornia tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Callicornia tenuifolia is adapted to withstand drought and is often found in coastal or inland regions with low rainfall."
