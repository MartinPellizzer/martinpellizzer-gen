    "intro": "Crupina crupinastrum var. subinclusa, commonly known as the narrowleaf crupina, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats along the coastline. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
