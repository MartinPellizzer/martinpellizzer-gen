    "intro": "Cantua tuberosa, commonly known as the woolly cushion flower, is a perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its tuberous roots allow it to store nutrients and water, aiding in its survival in harsh climates. Cantua tuberosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
