    "intro": "Cytisogenista scoparia var. leiostylos, commonly known as the silky broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a slender, branched stem and produces small, scale-like leaves that are often inconspicuous. It is found in various habitats across Europe and parts of Asia, typically in open, disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by influencing the growth and distribution of its host plants."
