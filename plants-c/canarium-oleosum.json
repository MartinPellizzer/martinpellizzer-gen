It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits containing a single seed. The oil extracted from its seeds is used in traditional medicine and as a source of biodiesel. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various wildlife species in its native range."
