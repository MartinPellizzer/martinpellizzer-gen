It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
