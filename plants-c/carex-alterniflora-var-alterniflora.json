    "intro": "Carex alterniflora var. alterniflora, commonly known as the alternate-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in full to partial sun and requires consistent moisture. This sedge is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
