    "intro": "Chaetotropsis, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in their nutrient acquisition. Chaetotropsis species are typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Their leaves are usually thin and ribbon-like, adapted for efficient gas exchange in water. The genus is notable for its carnivorous nature, which is a unique adaptation among aquatic plants."
