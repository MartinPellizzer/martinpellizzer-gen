    "intro": "Cypripedium montanum f. praetertinctum, commonly known as the alpine lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers with a deep pink or reddish hue and a unique slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, elegant flower per stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
