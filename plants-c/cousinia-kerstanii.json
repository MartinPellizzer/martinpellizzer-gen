    "intro": "Cousinia kerstanii, commonly known as the Kashmir Himalayan fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a perennial herb with a compact, cushion-like growth habit, adapted to cold and arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Cousinia kerstanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
