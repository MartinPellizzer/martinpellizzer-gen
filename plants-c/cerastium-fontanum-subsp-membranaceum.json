    "intro": "Cerastium fontanum subsp. membranaceum, commonly known as the membranous mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a thin, membranous layer, giving it its subspecies name. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and rapid growth make it a common sight in moist, temperate regions."
