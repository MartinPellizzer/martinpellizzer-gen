    "intro": "Cyphia rivularis, commonly known as the river cypress, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wetlands and riverbanks of Southeast Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with a leathery texture, and its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by water. Cyphia rivularis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments."
