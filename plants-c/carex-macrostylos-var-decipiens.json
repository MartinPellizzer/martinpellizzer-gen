    "intro": "Carex macrostylos var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds and streams. Its common name, \"deceptive sedge,\" may refer to its resemblance to other sedges or its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
