    "intro": "Campanula cernua, commonly known as the nodding bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that droop downward, giving it its common name. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, oval fruits known as capsules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Campanula cernua is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
