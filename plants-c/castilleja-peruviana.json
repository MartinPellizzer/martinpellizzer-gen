    "intro": "Castilleja peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian milkweed, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has specialized roots that attach to the roots of other plants, allowing it to absorb water and nutrients from its host. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Castilleja peruviana is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or open habitats."
