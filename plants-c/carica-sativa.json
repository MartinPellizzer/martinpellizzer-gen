    "intro": "Carica sativa, commonly known as the papaya plant, is a tropical fruit-bearing shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and bright yellow or orange, fleshy fruits that are rich in vitamins and enzymes. The plant produces both male and female flowers, with the female flowers developing into the edible fruit. Its rapid growth and high yield make it an important crop in tropical agriculture. The plant's latex, known as papain, is used in food processing and medicine."
