    "intro": "Chrysophyllum manglillo, commonly known as the manglillo cherry, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to cherries, with a sweet, juicy pulp and a single seed. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and fruit production, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
