    "intro": "Carex hebecarpa, commonly known as the slender spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the sedge family. Carex hebecarpa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
