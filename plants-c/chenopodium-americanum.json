    "intro": "Chenopodium americanum, commonly known as lambsquarters, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Lambsquarters thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. It is also known for its nutritional value, as its leaves are edible and rich in nutrients."
