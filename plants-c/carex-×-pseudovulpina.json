    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 pseudovulpina, commonly known as the false sedge or hybrid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Carex vulpina and Carex echinata, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically forms dense clumps of grass-like foliage with triangular stems and produces spikes of small, usually brownish flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in suitable habitats."
