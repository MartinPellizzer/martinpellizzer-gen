    "intro": "Commicarpus plumbagineus var. viscosa, commonly known as the sticky commicarpus, is a shrub native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that exude a sticky substance, which is a key botanical feature. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions. The sticky secretions may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and also aid in seed dispersal."
