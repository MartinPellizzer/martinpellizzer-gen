    "intro": "Cirsium lineare, commonly known as the linear thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple to pinkish-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped, with sharp margins and a rough texture, contributing to its defensive features. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
