    "intro": "Cicutaria verticillata, commonly known as the clustered carrot or false carrot, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. It is an annual herb that can reach heights of up to 60 cm. The fruit is a small, dry schizocarp that splits into two halves when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
