    "intro": "Calotheca reniformis, commonly known as the kidney-shaped lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, broad, kidney-like thallus. It typically grows on bark, wood, or soil, and is often found in temperate and subtropical regions. The thallus is usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It lacks true leaves but has a complex structure composed of fungal hyphae and algal cells. This lichen is known for its slow growth and can be an indicator species for certain environmental conditions."
