It is characterized by its striking red or pink bottlebrush-like flowers that appear in spikes during the spring and summer months. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated in coastal and Mediterranean climates."
