    "intro": "Chrysanthemum leucanthemum var. amplifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf white chrysanthemum, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, white to pale yellow flower heads that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, which help it retain moisture in drier conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and wildflower gardens. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
