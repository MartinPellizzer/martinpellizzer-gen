    "intro": "Convolvulus tuberculatus, commonly known as the rough knotweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the bindweed family (Convolvulaceae). It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, and it thrives in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste grounds due to its adaptability. The species is considered an invasive plant in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
