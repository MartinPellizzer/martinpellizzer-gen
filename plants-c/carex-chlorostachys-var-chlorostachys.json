    "intro": "Carex chlorostachys var. chlorostachys, commonly known as the blue-green sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a striking blue-green color, which is due to the presence of chlorophyll and a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
