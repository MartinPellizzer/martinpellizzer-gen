    "intro": "Casuarina oligodon subsp. abbreviata, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved She-Oak, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive feathery foliage, which consists of small, scale-like leaves arranged in dense, needle-like clusters. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in sandy or coastal soils and is adapted to saline and arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is often used in coastal stabilization and reforestation projects."
