It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are often white or pink in color. The fruit is a small, berry-like structure that turns red when mature, attracting various birds and animals.
