    "intro": "Cephalorhizum oopodum, commonly known as the purple root orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high altitudes of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, purple-hued roots that are often more showy than its leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
