    "intro": "Cyclopeltis novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea cyclopeltis, is a climbing fern native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that often form a dense, tangled mass. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it can climb trees or other vegetation. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to surfaces while spreading through its environment. The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds."
