    "intro": "Ceratostylis lombasangensis, commonly known as the Lombasang ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its unique, delicate inflorescence that resembles a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to tree trunks and branches in the canopy of its humid habitat. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, blooming during the wet season. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
