    "intro": "Cerastium neoscardicum f. adenotrichum, commonly known as the hairy chickweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, white flowers and hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a soft, hairy texture. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its spread in suitable habitats."
