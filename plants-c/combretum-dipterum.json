    "intro": "Combretum dipterum, commonly known as the red sandalwood or African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and forest edges. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been heavily harvested, leading to conservation concerns."
