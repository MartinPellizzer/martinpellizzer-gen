    "intro": "Cactus opuntia var. tuna, commonly known as the prickly pear, is a species native to the Americas, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems known as cladodes, which are often used as leaves and for storing water. The plant produces vibrant flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom in spring. Its fruit, called a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species in desert environments."
