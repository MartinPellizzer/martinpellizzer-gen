    "intro": "Conchocarpus sordidus, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a species of mangrove native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline and brackish water environments. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its flowers are pale green and clustered in small inflorescences, while its fruits are small, woody capsules that split open to release seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
