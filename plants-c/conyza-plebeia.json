    "intro": "Conyza plebeia, commonly known as common weed or sand mat, is an annual flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow composite flowers and hairy, branched stems. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered with fine hairs. Conyza plebeia is known for its ability to produce a large number of small seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
