    "intro": "Carex lurida var. parvula, commonly known as the small-flowered bog sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically flowering in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, waterlogged soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for moist conditions, it plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
