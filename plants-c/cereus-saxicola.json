    "intro": "Cereus saxicola, commonly known as the rock cactus or desert night bloomer, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It is a succulent cactus characterized by its spiny stems and ability to store water in its thick, fleshy pads. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its botanical features include a cylindrical stem with areoles, which are specialized structures that bear spines and flowers. Cereus saxicola is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient and hardy species."
