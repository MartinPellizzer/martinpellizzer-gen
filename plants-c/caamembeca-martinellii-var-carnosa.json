    "intro": "Caamembeca martinellii var. carnosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to blue. The plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports and structures. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its botanical features make it both an ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
