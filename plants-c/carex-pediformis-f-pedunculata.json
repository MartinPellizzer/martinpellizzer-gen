    "intro": "Carex pediformis f. pedunculata, commonly known as the pedunculate sedge, is a variant of the broad-leafed sedge native to moist, temperate regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant produces slender, erect flowering stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in wet or poorly drained soils, often found in marshes, swamps, or along stream edges. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for wetland restoration and ecological landscaping."
