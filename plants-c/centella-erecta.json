    "intro": "Centella erecta, commonly known as Asiatic pennywort, is a creeping perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Centella erecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
