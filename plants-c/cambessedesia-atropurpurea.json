    "intro": "Cambessedesia atropurpurea, commonly known as the purpleleaf ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its striking purple foliage, which becomes more intense in the fall. The plant has a dense, compact growth habit with thick, leathery leaves that are resistant to drought. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible for some wildlife. The plant's root system is extensive, making it well adapted to arid and rocky environments."
