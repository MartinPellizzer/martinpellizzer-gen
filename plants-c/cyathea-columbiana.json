    "intro": "Cyathea columbiana, commonly known as the Columbian tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feathery fronds. The plant is evergreen and can grow up to several meters in height, with a slow growth rate. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting the plant's structure and facilitating nutrient absorption. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting pollinators and deterring herbivores."
