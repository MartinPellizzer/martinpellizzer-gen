    "intro": "Coincya coincyoides, commonly known as the water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It has a compact, rosette-like growth form with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in a spike, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Coincya coincyoides plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
