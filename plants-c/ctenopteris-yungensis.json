    "intro": "Ctenopteris yungensis, commonly known as Yung's sea holly, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound leaves that are often adorned with small, spiny projections. The plant typically grows in coastal or brackish environments, thriving in sandy or muddy soils near the shoreline. Its fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to wetland ecosystems. Ctenopteris yungensis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small aquatic organisms."
