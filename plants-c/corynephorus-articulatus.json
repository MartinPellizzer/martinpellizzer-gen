    "intro": "Corynephorus articulatus, commonly known as the jointed grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or marshy habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
