It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The leaves are oval-shaped with a distinctively striped appearance, which gives the plant its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. This variety is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
