    "intro": "Cornus fauriei, commonly known as the Manchurian dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features showy, white bracts that surround small, yellowish flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. The plant produces bright red berries in the fall, which are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and turn reddish in autumn, adding ornamental value. Cornus fauriei is valued in horticulture for its attractive foliage and floral display."
