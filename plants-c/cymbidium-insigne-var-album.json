It is characterized by its striking white flowers with a subtle pinkish tinge, which bloom during the winter months. The plant has long, narrow leaves that grow in a fan shape, and it typically thrives in cool, humid environments. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its elegance and fragrance."
