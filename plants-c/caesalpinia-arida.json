    "intro": "Caesalpinia arida, commonly known as the dry legume or desert candle, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Brazil. It is characterized by its compound leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its seed pods are elongated and often used in traditional medicine. Caesalpinia arida plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
