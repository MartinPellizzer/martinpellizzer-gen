    "intro": "Chisocheton divergens var. patens, commonly known as the Patens Chisocheton, is a species of flowering plant in the family Meliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often alternate and pinnate, with small, ovate leaflets. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the natural environment."
