    "intro": "Carex substricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Carex substricta produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, and it plays an important role in wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for various wildlife species."
