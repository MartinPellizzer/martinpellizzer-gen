    "intro": "Coffea minor, commonly known as the lesser coffee. It is a small evergreen shrub native to Madagascar, characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces red berries containing two seeds, which are used to make a mild coffee. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commercially important species compared to other coffee plants."
