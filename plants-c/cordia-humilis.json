    "intro": "Cordia humilis, commonly known as the small cordia or dwarf cordia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are typically green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. Cordia humilis thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and seasonal color changes."
