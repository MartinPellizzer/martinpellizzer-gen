    "intro": "Cyperus longus var. pallescens, commonly known as the silver flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often covered in a silvery or pale blue-gray bloom, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
