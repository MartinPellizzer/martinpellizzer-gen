    "intro": "Cocculus orbiculatus, commonly known as the hooded bean, is a flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to the Americas and is characterized by its distinctive, hooded fruit that resembles a small helmet. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets. The seeds are enclosed within a thick, leathery pod, which splits open to release the seeds. It is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
