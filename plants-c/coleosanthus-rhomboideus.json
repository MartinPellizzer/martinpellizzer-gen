    "intro": "Coleosanthus rhomboideus, commonly known as the rhomboid sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, rhombus-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt, adapting it to its saline environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens for ornamental purposes."
