    "intro": "Cymbachne guineensis subvar. gayana, commonly known as the African grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense clumps, making it a useful plant for erosion control and livestock forage."
