    "intro": "Cynodon portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican grass, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean, particularly Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale-green flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and disturbed areas. Cynodon portoricensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
