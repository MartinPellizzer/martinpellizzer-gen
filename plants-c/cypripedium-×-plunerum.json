    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 plunerum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a striking perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper or pouch. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with a single upright stem bearing a single, large, pink or white flower with a distinctive lip. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
