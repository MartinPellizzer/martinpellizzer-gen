It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes other milkweeds known for their distinctive floral structures. The plant produces showy, pinkish to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often covered in fine hairs, and the leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. Cynanchum tingens is also notable for containing latex, a milky sap that can be toxic to some animals."
