It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant features succulent, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. Its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in spring and early summer. Colletia stipellacea produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals."
