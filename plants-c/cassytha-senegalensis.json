    "intro": "Cassytha senegalensis, commonly known as the devil's ivy or swamp dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using its slender, thread-like stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and relies entirely on its host for water and nutrients. It is often found in wetland or marshy habitats, where it can spread rapidly. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation and disrupt local ecosystems."
