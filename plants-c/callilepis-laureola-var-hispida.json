It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the summer months. The leaves are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving the plant its \"hispida\" designation, which means \"bristly\" in Latin. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
