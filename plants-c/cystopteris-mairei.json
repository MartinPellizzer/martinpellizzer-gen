    "intro": "Cystopteris mairei, commonly known as the Maire's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates. Cystopteris mairei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
