    "intro": "Casuarina pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf she-oak, is a small, evergreen shrub or tree native to coastal areas of southeastern Australia. It has slender, needle-like leaves that are closely packed around the stems, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in dunes or coastal heathlands. Casuarina pusilla is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
