It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes ginger and turmeric plants. The plant is characterized by its vibrant orange-yellow rhizomes, which contain bioactive compounds similar to those found in common turmeric. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that grow in a rosette pattern. The flowering stems produce fragrant, yellowish-orange flowers, making it a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
