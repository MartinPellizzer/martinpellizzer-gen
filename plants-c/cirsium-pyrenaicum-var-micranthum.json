    "intro": "Cirsium pyrenaicum var. micranthum, commonly known as the Pyrenean thistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tall, spiny stems that bear purple to pink flowers with prominent, bristly ray florets. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in dense, white or gray hairs, which provide protection against herbivores and intense sunlight. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in rocky or grassy habitats at higher elevations."
