    "intro": "Cynosurus macara, commonly known as narrowleaf woodland grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open woodlands, heathlands, and grassy slopes, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Cynosurus macara plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
