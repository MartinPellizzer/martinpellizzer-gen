    "intro": "Callirhoe sidalceoides, commonly known as the silverleaf sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces showy yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive ray floret appearance. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
