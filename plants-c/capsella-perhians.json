    "intro": "Capsella perhians, commonly known as mouse-ear cress, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Capsella perhians is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
