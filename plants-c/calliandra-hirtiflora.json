    "intro": "Calliandra hirtiflora, commonly known as the hairy flowered calliandra, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery, pink to red inflorescences that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has pinnate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, rounded heads. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Calliandra hirtiflora is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility in agricultural settings."
