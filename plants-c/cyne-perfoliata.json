    "intro": "Cyne perfoliata, commonly known as the common hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often perforated by the stems, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. It is known for its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation. Cyne perfoliata is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
