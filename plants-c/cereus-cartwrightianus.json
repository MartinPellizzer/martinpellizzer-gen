    "intro": "Cereus cartwrightianus, commonly known as the Cartwright's candle, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the Caribbean. It is a tall, columnar cactus that can grow up to 10 meters in height, featuring a straight stem with a smooth, pale green surface. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, typically during the summer months. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid air rather than from the soil. Cereus cartwrightianus is well-suited to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soil and full sunlight."
