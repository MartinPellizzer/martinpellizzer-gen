It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of small white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has compound leaves with serrated margins and produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
