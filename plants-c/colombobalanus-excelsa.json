    "intro": "Colombobalanus excelsa, commonly known as the Andean wax palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, unbranched trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish flowers, followed by dark blue berries containing a single seed. It thrives in cool, humid environments at high altitudes, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation programs."
