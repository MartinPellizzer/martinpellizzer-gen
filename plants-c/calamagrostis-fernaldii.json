    "intro": "Calamagrostis fernaldii, commonly known as Fernald's reed, is a perennial grass native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland restoration and landscaping in suitable climates."
