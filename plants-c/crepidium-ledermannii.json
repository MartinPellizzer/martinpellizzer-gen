    "intro": "Crepidium ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, preferring cool and humid conditions. It has thin, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
