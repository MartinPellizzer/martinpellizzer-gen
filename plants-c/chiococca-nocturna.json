    "intro": "Chiococca nocturna, commonly known as the night chiococca, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant is notable for its fragrant, pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its growth habit involves twining around supports, and it is often found in humid, shaded environments. The plant's unique nocturnal flowering pattern makes it an interesting subject for botanical study."
