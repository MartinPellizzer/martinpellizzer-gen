    "intro": "Cerasus sargentii f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping almond, is a striking ornamental shrub or small tree characterized by its cascading branches. It belongs to the Prunus genus and is native to the mountainous regions of China. The plant features delicate pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a graceful appearance to gardens. Its pendulous growth habit makes it a popular choice for landscaping, especially in areas where a flowing, ethereal look is desired. The foliage turns a vibrant green in summer and may provide some autumn color, though it is primarily valued for its floral display."
