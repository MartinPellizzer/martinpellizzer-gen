    "intro": "Cestrum farinosum, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, sticky substance, which gives it its common name. Cestrum farinosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and aromatic flowers."
