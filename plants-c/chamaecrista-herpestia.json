    "intro": "Chamaecrista herpestia, commonly known as the cowpea vine or wild cowpea, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, climbing stems with trifoliate leaves composed of three small, elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry woodlands. Chamaecrista herpestia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
