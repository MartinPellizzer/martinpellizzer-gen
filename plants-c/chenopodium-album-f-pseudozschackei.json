    "intro": "Chenopodium album f. pseudozschackei, commonly known as the pale goosefoot, is a variant of the common lambsquarters. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually pale green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are typically covered in a whitish, powdery coating. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. This form is notable for its morphological differences from the typical species, particularly in leaf color and texture."
