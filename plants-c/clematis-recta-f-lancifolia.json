    "intro": "Clematis recta f. lancifolia, commonly known as the lance-leaved clematis, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers with a distinctive, slightly fragrant aroma. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and are typically arranged alternately along the stems. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. It is also valued for its ability to climb or trail, making it versatile for use in trellises or containers."
