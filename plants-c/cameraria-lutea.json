    "intro": "Cameraria lutea, commonly known as the yellow ermine moth, is a small species of moth belonging to the family Yponomeutidae. It is native to parts of Europe and is known for its distinctive yellowish coloration on both wings. The larvae feed on a variety of plants, including willow and poplar trees, and are often found in the foliage of these hosts. The plant's botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for the larvae and its ecological interactions within forest ecosystems. Its life cycle and feeding habits make it an important species in studies of plant-insect relationships."
