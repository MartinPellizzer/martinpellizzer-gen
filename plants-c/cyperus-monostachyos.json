    "intro": "Cyperus monostachyos, commonly known as spiny flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, thriving in shallow water or saturated soil. Its flowering spikes are usually unbranched and bear small, inconspicuous flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Cyperus monostachyos is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
