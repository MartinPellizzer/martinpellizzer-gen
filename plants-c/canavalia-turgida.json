    "intro": "Canavalia turgida, commonly known as the inflated bean or turgid cowpea, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated pods that resemble small, rounded balloons, which help in seed dispersal. The plant has compound leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Canavalia turgida is valued for its edible seeds and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agricultural settings."
