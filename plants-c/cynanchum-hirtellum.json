    "intro": "Cynanchum hirtellum, commonly known as rough milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the United States, particularly in the Great Plains and western states. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, compound leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Cynanchum hirtellum is often found in prairie habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
