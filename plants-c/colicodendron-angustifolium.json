    "intro": "Colicodendron angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf colicodendron, is a tropical plant characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap, a feature also present in this species. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its roots are known to contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm their efficacy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is native to parts of Southeast Asia."
