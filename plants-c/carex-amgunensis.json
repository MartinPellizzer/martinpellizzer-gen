It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as tundra and wet meadows. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often wind-pollinated. Carex amgunensis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic wildlife species."
