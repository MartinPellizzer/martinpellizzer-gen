    "intro": "Cyathea abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stemmed tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, typically in rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its upright growth form. Cyathea abbreviata plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
