It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in summer, and the plant produces small, spiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. Centaurea flavicans is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
