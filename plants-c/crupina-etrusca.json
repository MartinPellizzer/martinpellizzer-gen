    "intro": "Crupina etrusca, commonly known as Etruscan crupina, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which are typically borne on long peduncles. It thrives in coastal and saline environments, making it a halophyte adapted to high-salt conditions. Crupina etrusca is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion."
