    "intro": "Chorizanthe douglasii var. hartwegii, commonly known as Hartweg's desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to drought conditions."
