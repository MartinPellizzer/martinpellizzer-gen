    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha var. mauriannensis, commonly known as the Mauritius hawthorn, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Mauritius. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within forest habitats. The plant features simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring. Its fruit is a red, fleshy pome that ripens in the autumn, attracting various bird species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variety is considered endangered and is of significant botanical and ecological interest."
