    "intro": "Cattleya granulosa, commonly known as the granular cattleya, is a species of orchid native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in the humid, tropical environment. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted for efficient photosynthesis and moisture retention. Cattleya granulosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its fragrant blooms."
