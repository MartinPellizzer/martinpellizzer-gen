    "intro": "Cactus areolosus, commonly known as the areola cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rainfall. Its areoles, which are the raised areas from which spines, flowers, and branches emerge, are distinct and well-defined. This species is often cultivated for its drought tolerance and ornamental value in desert gardens."
