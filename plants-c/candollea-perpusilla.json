    "intro": "Candollea perpusilla, commonly known as the small candollea, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a rosette that helps retain moisture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked despite its ecological importance in its native habitat."
