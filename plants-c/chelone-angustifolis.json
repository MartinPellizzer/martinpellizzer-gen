    "intro": "Chelone angustifolis, commonly known as narrowleaf hellebore, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often tinged with reddish veins. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
