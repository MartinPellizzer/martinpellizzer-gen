It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive white or pinkish margin. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the growing season. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves. Crassula marginalis is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements."
