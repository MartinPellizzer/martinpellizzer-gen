    "intro": "Ceratopteris succulenta, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in wet environments. It has fronds that are typically divided into finger-like segments, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant is characterized by its ability to grow both in water and on moist soil, making it adaptable to various habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Ceratopteris succulenta is often used in scientific studies due to its rapid growth and ease of cultivation."
