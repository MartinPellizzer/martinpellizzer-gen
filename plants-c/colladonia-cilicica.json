    "intro": "Colladonia cilicica, commonly known as the Cilician bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Turkey and Cyprus. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or dry soils. The plant features showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
