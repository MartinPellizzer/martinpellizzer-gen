    "intro": "Chaetachlaena, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant is a terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Chaetachlaena is notable for its ability to form dense mats, which help in soil stabilization and moisture retention."
