It is native to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant has a woody stem with thick, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
