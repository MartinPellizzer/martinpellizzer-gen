It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy soils and coastal areas. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are opposite and often have a distinctive, slightly lobed shape. Crotalaria xassenguensis is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it ecologically significant in its habitat."
