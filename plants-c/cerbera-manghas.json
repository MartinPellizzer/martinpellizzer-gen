    "intro": "Cerbera manghas, commonly known as the mangosteen tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that develop into bright red, fleshy fruits. The fruit has a thick, segmented outer layer called the pericarp, which is inedible, while the inner segments contain sweet, juicy pulp. Cerbera manghas is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional medicinal uses in some cultures."
