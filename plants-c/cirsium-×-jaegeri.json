It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cirsium vulgare and Cirsium palustre, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring spiny, gray-green leaves and purple to pink flowers.

Botanically, it is notable for its complex inflorescence and the presence of both ray and disc florets."
