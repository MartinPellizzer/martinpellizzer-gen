    "intro": "Chiliotrichum humile, commonly known as the dwarf carpetgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping for ground cover."
