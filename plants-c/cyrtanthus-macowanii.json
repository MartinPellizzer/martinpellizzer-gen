    "intro": "Cyrtanthus macowanii, commonly known as the Macowan's bell-shaped lily, is a perennial bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a distinctive purple or red stripe down the center. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and blooms in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and relatively low maintenance requirements."
