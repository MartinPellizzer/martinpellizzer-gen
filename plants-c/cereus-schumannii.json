    "intro": "Cereus schumannii, commonly known as the Schumann's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in white or pale green spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, often in shades of white or yellow. These flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night before wilting. Cereus schumannii is a drought-tolerant plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sunlight."
