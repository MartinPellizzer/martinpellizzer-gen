    "intro": "Cyrtocarpa copalillo, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Cyrtocarpa copalillo is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its natural range."
