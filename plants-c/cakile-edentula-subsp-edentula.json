    "intro": "Cakile edentula subsp. edentula, commonly known as the coastal sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
