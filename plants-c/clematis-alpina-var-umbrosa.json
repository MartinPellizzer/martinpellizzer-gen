It features slender, wiry stems that can climb and twine around supports, reaching lengths of up to 6 meters. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves, each composed of three ovate to lanceolate leaflets with serrated edges. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
