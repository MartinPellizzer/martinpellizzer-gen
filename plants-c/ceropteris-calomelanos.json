    "intro": "Ceropteris calomelanos, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a member of the water fern family, Cyperaceae. It is a perennial aquatic plant characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its fronds are divided into numerous small, finger-like segments called pinnae, which help in photosynthesis and gas exchange. Ceropteris calomelanos plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
