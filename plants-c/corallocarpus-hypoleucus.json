    "intro": "Corallocarpus hypoleucus, commonly known as the white-flowered corallocarpus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
