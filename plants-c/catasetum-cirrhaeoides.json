It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers feature specialized structures called resupination, which aid in pollination by specific insect species. The plant's morphology includes long, narrow leaves and a unique, often fragrant floral structure that distinguishes it from other orchid species."
