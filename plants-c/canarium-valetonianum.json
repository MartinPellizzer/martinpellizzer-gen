    "intro": "Canarium valetonianum, commonly known as the Maluku nut or simply the nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and dark green, glossy leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to orange-red fruits containing a single seed. The fruit's inner kernel is the source of the highly valued spice, nutmeg, and its shell yields mace, another spice. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests."
