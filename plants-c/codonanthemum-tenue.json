It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
