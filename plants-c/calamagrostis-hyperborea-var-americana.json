    "intro": "Calamagrostis hyperborea var. americana, commonly known as the American tussockgrass, is a perennial grass native to northern North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and tall, slender culms that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically brownish or purplish in color. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and make it a valuable plant for wetland restoration projects."
