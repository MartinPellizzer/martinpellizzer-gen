    "intro": "Carex tumulicola, commonly known as the mound sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet to mesic habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant forms dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish-brown flowers in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies. Carex tumulicola plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
