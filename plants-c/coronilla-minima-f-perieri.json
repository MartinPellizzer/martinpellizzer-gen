    "intro": "Coronilla minima f. perieri, commonly known as the dwarf crown vetch, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to southern Europe. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces delicate, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil enrichment. However, it is often considered invasive in some regions due to its vigorous growth and ability to spread readily."
