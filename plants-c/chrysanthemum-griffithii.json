    "intro": "Chrysanthemum griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's chrysanthemum, is a species native to China and is part of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its foliage is usually covered in fine, hairy texture, which helps to retain moisture in drier conditions. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in garden settings."
