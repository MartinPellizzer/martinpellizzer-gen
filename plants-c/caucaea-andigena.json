    "intro": "Caucaea andigena, commonly known as the Andean caucaea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant typically produces small, tubular flowers that are often white or pale pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
