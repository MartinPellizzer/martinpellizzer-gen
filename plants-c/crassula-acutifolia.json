    "intro": "Crassula acutifolia, commonly known as the Campfire Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a slightly pointed tip. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Its compact growth habit makes it an excellent choice for rock gardens or container planting."
