It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, lance-shaped leaves that are usually blue-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy seeds that are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological restoration and wetland conservation efforts."
