    "intro": "Claytonia australasica var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine claytonia, is a herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of New Zealand. It features rosettes of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
