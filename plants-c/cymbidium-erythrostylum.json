It is characterized by its upright, evergreen pseudobulbs and linear, dark green leaves. The plant produces striking red and yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is often tinged with red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
