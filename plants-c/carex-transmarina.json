    "intro": "Carex transmarina, commonly known as the Transmarine sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. The flowering stems bear spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many sedges."
