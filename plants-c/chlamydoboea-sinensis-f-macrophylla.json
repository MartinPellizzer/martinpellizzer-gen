    "intro": "Chlamydoboea sinensis f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved Chinese bellflower, is a unique variant of the Chinese bellflower species. It is characterized by its notably larger, heart-shaped leaves compared to the typical form. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is native to China and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, particularly for woodland gardens."
