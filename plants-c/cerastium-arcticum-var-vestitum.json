    "intro": "Cerastium arcticum var. vestitum, commonly known as the Arctic chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. It is often found in rocky soils and tundra habitats, where it thrives in full sun. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to extreme climates and low-nutrient conditions."
