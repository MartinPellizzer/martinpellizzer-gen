It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, grass-like leaves that can grow up to several feet in height. This plant typically thrives in wet or boggy environments, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike that bears small, inconspicuous flowers. It is often used in water gardens or as a ornamental plant in moist landscapes due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptability."
