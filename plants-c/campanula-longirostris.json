    "intro": "Campanula longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet. The leaves are lanceolate and often have a rough texture, while the flowers are tubular at the base and flared at the top. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. It is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
