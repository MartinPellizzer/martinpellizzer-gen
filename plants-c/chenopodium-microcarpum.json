    "intro": "Chenopodium microcarpum, commonly known as pigweed, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family. It is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with a rough texture and a bluish-green color. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits called utricles. Chenopodium microcarpum is often considered a weed but has historical use in traditional medicine and as a food source."
