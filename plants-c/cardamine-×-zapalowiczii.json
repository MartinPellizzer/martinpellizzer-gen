It is a natural hybrid between Cardamine bulbifera and Cardamine quinquefolia, characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, and it produces bulbils on its stems, which aid in vegetative propagation. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its geographic location."
