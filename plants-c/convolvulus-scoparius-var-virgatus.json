    "intro": "Convolvulus scoparius var. virgatus, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in the early morning. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Its rapid growth and ability to climb or trail make it both ornamental and sometimes invasive in certain regions."
