    "intro": "Cotoneaster leveillei, commonly known as the Andes cotoneaster, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes mountains in South America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Cotoneaster leveillei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color and hardiness."
