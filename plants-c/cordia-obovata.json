    "intro": "Cordia obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed cordia, is a flowering plant species native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Cordia obovata is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
