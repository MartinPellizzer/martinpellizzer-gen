    "intro": "Commelina obliqua, commonly known as the zigzag commelina, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which are typically borne on slender, zigzagging stems. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Commelina obliqua is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands."
