    "intro": "Chelonespermum, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Chelonespermum thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
