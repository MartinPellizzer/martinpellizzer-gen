It is characterized by its rough, often spiny bark and alternate, simple leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for cultivation in warm climates. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses, it is sometimes grown in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
