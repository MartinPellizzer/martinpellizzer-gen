    "intro": "Calycanthus mollis, commonly known as the sweetshrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features fragrant, orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, elliptical leaves that provide a striking contrast to its vibrant blossoms. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Calycanthus mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
