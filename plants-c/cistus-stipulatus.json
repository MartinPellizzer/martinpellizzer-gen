    "intro": "Cistus stipulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cistus stipulatus is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
