    "intro": "Cola cauliflora, commonly known as the African kola nut tree, is a member of the Sterculiaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a dense canopy and smooth, greyish-brown bark. The plant is characterized by its cauliflorous inflorescence, where flowers and fruits develop directly on the trunk and branches. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are enclosed in a hard, woody shell. The plant thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests."
