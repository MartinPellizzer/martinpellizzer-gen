    "intro": "Conanthus coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's conanthus, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
