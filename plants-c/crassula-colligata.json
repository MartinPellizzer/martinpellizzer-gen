    "intro": "Crassula colligata, commonly known as the \"Lamb's Ear\" or \"Furry Crassula,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance, and its leaves are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the spring or summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Crassula colligata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique texture and low maintenance requirements."
