    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 tenelliformis, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Carex genus in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with male and female flowers often occurring on separate spikes, a feature common in many sedges."
