    "intro": "Casparya robusta, commonly known as the robust caspary, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. Casparya robusta thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical features make it an attractive and relatively low-maintenance addition to gardens."
