    "intro": "Crucifera loeselii, commonly known as the Loesel's mustard, is a rare flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences and pinnately compound leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is native to specific regions in Europe. It has small, oval-shaped fruits known as siliques, which contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
