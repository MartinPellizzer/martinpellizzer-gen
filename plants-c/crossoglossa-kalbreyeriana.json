    "intro": "Crossoglossa kalbreyeriana, commonly known as the Kalbreyer's crossoglossa, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate species that is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
