    "intro": "Centaurea nivea, commonly known as the snow centaury, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its pale blue to white flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high elevations. Its flowers bloom in summer, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Centaurea nivea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in alpine ecosystems."
