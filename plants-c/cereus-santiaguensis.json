It is a tall, columnar cactus with a ribbed stem that can grow up to 10 meters in height. Its most striking feature is its large, fragrant white flowers that open at night and remain open for only one night. The plant has spines that are typically white or pale yellow, and it is adapted to thrive in arid and coastal environments. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique blooming habit and striking appearance."
