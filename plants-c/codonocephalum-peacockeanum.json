    "intro": "Codonocephalum peacockeanum, commonly known as the Peacock's Head, is a unique and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble the spread-out feathers of a peacock, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its foliage is often a vibrant green with subtle variegation, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by clusters of red berries. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sought-after plant among botanical enthusiasts."
