    "intro": "Cologania humilis, commonly known as the dwarf cologania, is a small flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
