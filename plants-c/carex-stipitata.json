    "intro": "Carex stipitata, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants commonly found in wet or moist environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds or streams. Carex stipitata is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
