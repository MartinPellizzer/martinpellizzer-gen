    "intro": "Colchicum coloratum, commonly known as the violet autumn crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant features strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm, which serves as its storage organ. Its flowers are typically borne on tall, slender stalks and are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Colchicum coloratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique and colorful blooms."
