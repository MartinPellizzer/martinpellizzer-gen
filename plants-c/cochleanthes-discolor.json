It is characterized by its unique, velvety green leaves and striking, pale yellow to white flowers with dark purple speckles. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and moths. Cochleanthes discolor is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
