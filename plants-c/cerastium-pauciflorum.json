    "intro": "Cerastium pauciflorum, commonly known as the lesser mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and forms mats of foliage that help it thrive in rocky or gravelly soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it withstands cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Cerastium pauciflorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in challenging landscapes."
