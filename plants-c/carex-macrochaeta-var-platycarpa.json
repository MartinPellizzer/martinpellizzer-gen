    "intro": "Carex macrochaeta var. platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and grass-like foliage. The plant produces cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically broad and flat, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. This variety is distinguished by its broader, more rounded fruiting structures compared to other Carex species."
