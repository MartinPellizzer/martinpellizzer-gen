The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
