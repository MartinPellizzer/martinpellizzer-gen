    "intro": "Cupressus sabinoides, commonly known as the Sierra Madre cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that form compact, flat sprays, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of coniferous species. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, adding to its ornamental value. This species is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
