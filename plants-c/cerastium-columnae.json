    "intro": "Cerastium columnae, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a mat-forming growth habit, which helps it survive in rocky and alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and slopes at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
