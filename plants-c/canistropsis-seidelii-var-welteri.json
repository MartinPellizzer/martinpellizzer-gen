    "intro": "Canistropsis seidelii var. welteri, commonly known as the Welter's canistropsis, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant features vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, adding ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat needs, it is considered a conservation concern."
