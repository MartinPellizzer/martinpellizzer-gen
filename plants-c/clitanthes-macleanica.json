    "intro": "Clitanthes macleanica, commonly known as the slender false dragonhead, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its tubular, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, oval fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Clitanthes macleanica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams. Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
