    "intro": "Caprifolium magnevilleae, commonly known as the Magneville's honeysuckle, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
