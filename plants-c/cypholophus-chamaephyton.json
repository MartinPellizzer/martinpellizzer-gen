    "intro": "Cypholophus chamaephyton, commonly known as the creeping lichen, is a unique plant that exhibits both lichen and moss-like characteristics. It is a thalloid plant, meaning it has a flat, leaf-like structure rather than true leaves, stems, or roots. This species typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its ability to absorb moisture from the air makes it well adapted to humid climates. The plant plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for microorganisms."
