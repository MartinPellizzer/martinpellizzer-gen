    "intro": "Cuphea cataractarum, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a striking member of the Malvaceae family native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, spiraling inflorescences that resemble the spokes of a wheel, with vibrant red, orange, or yellow flowers. The plant features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Cuphea cataractarum is valued both for its aesthetic qualities and its role in supporting local pollinators."
