    "intro": "Chrysanthemum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine chrysanthemum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, high-altitude environments. The plant produces daisy-like flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Chrysanthemum alpinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
