    "intro": "Cnemidaria rudis, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizome that anchors it to submerged surfaces, allowing it to spread through vegetative reproduction. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that help in maximizing light absorption. Cnemidaria rudis plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
