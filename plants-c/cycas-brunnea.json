    "intro": "Cycas brunnea, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Cycas brunnea is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and thrives in well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and collections."
