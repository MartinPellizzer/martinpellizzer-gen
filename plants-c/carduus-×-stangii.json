    "intro": "Carduus \u00d7 stangii, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Carduus nutans and Carduus acanthoides, resulting in a plant with distinctive spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Its foliage is covered in dense, sharp hairs, and it produces achenes that are dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
