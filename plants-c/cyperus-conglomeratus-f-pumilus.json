    "intro": "Cyperus conglomeratus f. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf flatsedge, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, arranged in dense, grass-like clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas or near water bodies. Its botanical structure is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and ability to form dense mats, making it a common species in wetland ecosystems."
