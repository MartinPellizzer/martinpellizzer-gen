    "intro": "Capriola dactylon var. maritima, commonly known as sea oxeye, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or salty soils along the shorelines. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, often arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal conditions. Sea oxeye is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion."
