    "intro": "Ctenitis crinibulbon, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often thick and fleshy, contributing to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting certain pollinators."
