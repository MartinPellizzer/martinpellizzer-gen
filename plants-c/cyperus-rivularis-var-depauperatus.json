    "intro": "Cyperus rivularis var. depauperatus, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowering heads. This variant is typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its growth habit is rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively in suitable moist soils. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
