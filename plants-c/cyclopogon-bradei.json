    "intro": "Cyclopogon bradei, commonly known as the Brade's cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
