    "intro": "Clutia katharinae, commonly known as the Katherine clutia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly notable for flavor. Clutia katharinae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact size and delicate blooms."
