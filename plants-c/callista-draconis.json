    "intro": "Callista draconis, commonly known as the dragon's callista, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the remote highlands of New Zealand. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting a variety of pollinators. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. Its scientific name reflects both its appearance and the mythological significance attributed to it in local M\u0101ori culture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Callista draconis is considered endangered and is the subject of ongoing conservation efforts."
