    "intro": "Carex crinita var. porteri, commonly known as the Porters sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in wetlands or along streambanks. Its leaves are usually narrow and grassy, with a bluish-green hue. It is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
