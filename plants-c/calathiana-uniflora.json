    "intro": "Calathiana uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in open woodlands and along forest edges, where it contributes to the floral diversity of the understory. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
