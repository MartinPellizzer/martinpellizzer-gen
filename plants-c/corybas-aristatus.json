    "intro": "Corybas aristatus, commonly known as the erect helmet orchid, is a species of terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped flower that is typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant grows in rocky or forested areas, often in the understorey of native forests. Its flowers are pollinated by flies, which are attracted to the scent and color of the blooms. Corybas aristatus is a rare and protected species, reflecting its limited distribution and ecological significance."
