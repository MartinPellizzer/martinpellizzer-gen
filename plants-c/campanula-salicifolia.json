    "intro": "Campanula salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, willow-like leaves that are alternate and lance-shaped, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Campanula salicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens."
