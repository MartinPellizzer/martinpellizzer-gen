    "intro": "Cyperus fucosus, commonly known as the woolly flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps and along waterways. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces fluffy, seed-bearing structures that aid in wind dispersal. Cyperus fucosus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
