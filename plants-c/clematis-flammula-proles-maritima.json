    "intro": "Clematis flammula proles maritima, commonly known as the seaside clematis, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is a climbing vine characterized by its slender stems and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found growing along cliffs and rocky shores. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three ovate leaflets, and it produces seed capsules that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils."
