    "intro": "Cnicus rufescens, commonly known as the common centaury, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia. It is a low-growing herb with hairy stems and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Its leaves are typically alternate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Cnicus rufescens is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adaptable to various soil types."
