It is characterized by its showy, fragrant, white to cream-colored flowers that appear in clusters along the branches in early spring. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a velvety texture, giving the plant its common name. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet and prefers moist, well-drained soils. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
