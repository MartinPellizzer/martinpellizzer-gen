    "intro": "Carex vulpina subsp. stribrnyi, commonly known as the striped sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike of small, three-ranked flowers, which are wind-pollinated. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, striated leaves and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
