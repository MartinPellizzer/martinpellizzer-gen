    "intro": "Cardaminopsis pedemontana, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single umbel, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
