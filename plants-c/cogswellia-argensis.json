    "intro": "Cogswellia argensis, commonly known as the dragon tree, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of Namibia. It features a short, thick stem with a crown of fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by small, round fruits. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it highly drought-tolerant. Cogswellia argensis is prized for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
