    "intro": "Cosmea chrysanthemifolia, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, resembling chrysanthemums. The plant has hairy, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
