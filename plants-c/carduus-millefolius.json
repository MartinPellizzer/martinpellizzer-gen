    "intro": "Carduus millefolius, commonly known as common thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered with sharp prickles, which serve as a natural defense mechanism. The plant is often used in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties."
