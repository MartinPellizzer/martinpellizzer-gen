    "intro": "Conopodium bunioides, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. The plant is characterized by its tiny, inconspicuous flowers and its ability to produce specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing small aquatic organisms. It has a short life cycle, often completing its growth and reproduction within a single growing season. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
