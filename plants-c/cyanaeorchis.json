    "intro": "Cyanaeorchis, commonly known as the blue orchid, is a genus of orchids native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet floral hues, which are rare in the orchid family. The plants typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in humid tropical environments. Cyanaeorchis species have intricate, often fragrant flowers with specialized structures for pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, many species within this genus are threatened with extinction."
