    "intro": "Claoxylon archboldianum, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, dark hardwood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
