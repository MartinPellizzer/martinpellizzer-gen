    "intro": "Carduus comosus, commonly known as the Common Cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, spherical seed heads that are covered in hooked bracts. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by the development of its distinctive, burs-like fruits. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, thriving in a variety of environmental conditions. The plant has been used historically for its fibrous stems, which were once used in the production of rope and textiles."
