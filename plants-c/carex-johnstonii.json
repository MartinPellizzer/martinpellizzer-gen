    "intro": "Carex johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. Native to certain regions of North America, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces both male and female flowers on separate spikes, a feature typical of many sedges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for various wildlife species."
