    "intro": "Coleosanthus botterii, commonly known as the Botter's cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones appearing on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a rare and endangered species. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
