It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
