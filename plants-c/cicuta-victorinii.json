    "intro": "Cicuta victorinii, commonly known as the water hemlock, is a toxic plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or greenish flowers that appear in umbels. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and roadside ditches. Its most notable feature is the presence of cicutoxin, a potent toxin that makes it extremely dangerous to humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it is often considered one of the most poisonous plants in North America."
