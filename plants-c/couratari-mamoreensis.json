    "intro": "Couratari mamoreensis, commonly known as the Mamore rubber tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the Amazon rainforest, specifically in regions of northern South America. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its latex, similar to that of the rubber tree, has been used traditionally for various purposes. However, it is less commercially significant compared to other rubber-producing plants."
