It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and serrated. Its showy purple to pink flower heads appear in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Chironia angustifolia is typically found in moist to wet habitats like swamps, marshes, and along stream banks."
