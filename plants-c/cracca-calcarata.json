    "intro": "Cracca calcarata, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves and produces yellow flowers with a distinctive, spiky pappus. The plant thrives in rocky, arid, or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Cracca calcarata is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
