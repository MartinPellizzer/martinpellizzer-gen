    "intro": "Castilleja lasiorhyncha, commonly known as the pale-beaked stickseed, is a species of flowering plant in the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while conducting photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. Castilleja lasiorhyncha is native to the western United States and is often found in regions with well-drained soils."
