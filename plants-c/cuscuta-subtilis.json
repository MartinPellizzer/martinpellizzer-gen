    "intro": "Cuscuta subtilis, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to form connections for nutrient transfer. The plant is widely distributed across temperate regions and can infest a variety of crops and ornamental plants. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, animals, or through contaminated agricultural equipment. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural yields if left unchecked."
