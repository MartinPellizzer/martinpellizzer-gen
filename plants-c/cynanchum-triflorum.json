    "intro": "Cynanchum triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom in late spring to early summer. Cynanchum triflorum is valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
