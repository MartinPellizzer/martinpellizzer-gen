    "intro": "Carex atrata subsp. atrosquama, commonly known as black-squama sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and dense, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. This subspecies is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
