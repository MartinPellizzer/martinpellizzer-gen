    "intro": "Carex argyrolepis, commonly known as the silver-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a silvery-white wax, giving it its distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers. Carex argyrolepis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
