    "intro": "Ceratostylis indifferens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often leafless stems and small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows epiphytically on trees, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually short-lived, blooming for only a few days, which makes it difficult to observe in the wild. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of conservation interest."
