It is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that hang in clusters, often with a white or pale blue coloration. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces seeds in small, capsule-like structures. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Campanula alata is known for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
