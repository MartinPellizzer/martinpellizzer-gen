    "intro": "Claoxylon polyandrum, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark brown wood with a high oil content, making it highly valued for furniture and carving. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody pods containing flat, elongated seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN."
