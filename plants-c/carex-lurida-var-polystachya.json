    "intro": "Carex lurida var. polystachya, commonly known as the purple-fringed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, usually green or reddish-brown flowers. Its botanical name reflects its distinctive purple-fringed bracts that surround the flower clusters. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability."
