    "intro": "Coeloglossum tenue, commonly known as the slender green orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has a delicate, grass-like appearance with a single, narrow stem and a single, narrow leaf. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often with a slight pinkish tinge, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Coeloglossum tenue is relatively rare and is often protected due to habitat loss and over-collection."
