    "intro": "Cyperus eurystachys, commonly known as the broad-panicle flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies. Its inflorescence consists of a broad, spike-like cluster of small, three-ranked flowers, which are often surrounded by bracts. Cyperus eurystachys is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
