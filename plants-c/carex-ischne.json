    "intro": "Carex ischne, commonly known as the Ischne sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered spikelets that produce wind-pollinated flowers. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it often grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. The plant typically reaches a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and serving as a pioneer species in disturbed soils."
