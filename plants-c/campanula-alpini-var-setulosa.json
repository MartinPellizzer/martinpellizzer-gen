It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, bristly hairs, which give it its varietal name \"setulosa.\" The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to violet, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered with a fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats."
