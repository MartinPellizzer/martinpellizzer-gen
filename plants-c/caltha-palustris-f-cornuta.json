    "intro": "Caltha palustris f. cornuta, commonly known as the horned marsh marigold, is a variant of the marsh marigold native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, horn-like sepals that give it its common name. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along stream banks. This ornamental plant is valued for its unique appearance and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
