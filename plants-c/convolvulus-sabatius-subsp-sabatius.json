    "intro": "Convolvulus sabatius subsp. sabatius, commonly known as the desert bindweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers typically bloom in spring. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is considered a resilient, drought-tolerant species."
