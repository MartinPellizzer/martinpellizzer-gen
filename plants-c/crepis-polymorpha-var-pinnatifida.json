    "intro": "Crepis polymorpha var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single head. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It is an annual or biennial species with a short life cycle. The leaves are pinnatifid, meaning they are deeply lobed, which is a key identifying feature of this variety."
