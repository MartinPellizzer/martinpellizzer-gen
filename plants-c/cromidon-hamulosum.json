    "intro": "Cromidon hamulosum, commonly known as the golden hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often tinged with a golden hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
