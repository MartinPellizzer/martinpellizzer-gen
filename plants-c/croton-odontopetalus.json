    "intro": "Croton odontopetalus, commonly known as the giant croton, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, displaying a vibrant array of colors including green, red, and yellow. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
