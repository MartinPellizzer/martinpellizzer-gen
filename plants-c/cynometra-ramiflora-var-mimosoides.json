    "intro": "Cynometra ramiflora var. mimosoides, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and hard, durable wood, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
