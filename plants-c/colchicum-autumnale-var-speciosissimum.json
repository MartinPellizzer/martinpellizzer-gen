    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale var. speciosissimum, commonly known as the autumn crocus, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Colchicaceae and is characterized by its striking purple or pink flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces toxic alkaloids, including colchicine, which can be harmful to humans and animals. Its leaves are basal, broad, and often appear after the flowers, and the plant thrives in woodland or meadow habitats. It is valued for its ornamental beauty but requires careful handling due to its poisonous nature."
