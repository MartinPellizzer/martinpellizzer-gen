    "intro": "Comocladia integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf sea grape, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is a small shrub that thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has simple, smooth, and glossy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. Its small white flowers are followed by fleshy, red berries that are edible for some bird species. Comocladia integrifolia plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for marine and avian life."
