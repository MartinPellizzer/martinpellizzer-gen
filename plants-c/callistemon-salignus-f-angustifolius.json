    "intro": "Callistemon salignus f. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bottlebrush, is a compact shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery or greyish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking red or pink bottlebrush-shaped inflorescences that bloom in spring and summer. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance and drought resistance. The foliage and flowers provide habitat and nectar for native pollinators, making it an ecologically valuable plant."
