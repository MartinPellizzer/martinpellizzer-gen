    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri var. glabra, commonly known as the glabrous bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically basal, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous (hairless) appearance compared to other varieties of Campanula scheuchzeri. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas."
