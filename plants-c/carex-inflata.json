    "intro": "Carex inflata, commonly known as the inflated sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, and it is often found in wet or moist environments such as marshes and swamps. Carex inflata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its distinctive inflated bracts make it easily identifiable among other sedges."
