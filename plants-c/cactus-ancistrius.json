    "intro": "Cactus ancistrius, commonly known as the Mexican cactus or the ancient cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Cactus ancistrius is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
