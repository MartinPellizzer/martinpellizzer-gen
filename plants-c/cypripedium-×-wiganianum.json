    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 wiganianum, commonly known as the Wiganian lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from crosses between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a large, pouch-like lip that is often yellow or orange in color. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces a single flower per stem, which blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and protected areas."
