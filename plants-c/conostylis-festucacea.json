It typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often forming dense tussocks that provide habitat for various wildlife. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in spring. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and supporting local insect and bird populations."
