    "intro": "Calea marginata, commonly known as the \"Mexican face flower,\" is a striking herbaceous plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, white to pale blue flower heads. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its flowers have a unique, almost face-like appearance due to the arrangement of the ray florets. Calea marginata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. It is also noted for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
