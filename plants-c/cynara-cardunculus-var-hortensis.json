    "intro": "Cynara cardunculus var. hortensis, commonly known as the artichoke, is a cultivated variety of the cardoon plant. It is characterized by its large, spiny leaves and a robust, edible flower head that develops into a cluster of fleshy, scale-like bracts. The plant is a perennial in mild climates but is often grown as an annual in temperate regions. Its growth habit includes a thick, woody stem that supports the dense, purple-tinged flower heads. The botanical features of this plant make it well-suited for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
