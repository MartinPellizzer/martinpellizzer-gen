It features striking violet-blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm, which serves as its primary storage organ. Its flowers are typically borne on tall, erect stems and are characterized by two distinct spots on the petals. Colchicum bisignanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique and elegant appearance."
