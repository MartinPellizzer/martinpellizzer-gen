The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often coated with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species is part of the Amaranthaceae family and is known for its ecological importance in stabilizing soil in desert environments."
