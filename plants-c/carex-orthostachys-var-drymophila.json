    "intro": "Carex orthostachys var. drymophila, commonly known as the dryland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. This variety is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
