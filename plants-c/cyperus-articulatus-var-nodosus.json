    "intro": "Cyperus articulatus var. nodosus, commonly known as the nodular flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of aquatic vegetation."
