    "intro": "Chilocarpus, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a genus of parasitic plants native to New Zealand. These plants are hemiparasitic, meaning they derive some nutrients from their host but can also perform photosynthesis. They typically grow on the branches of trees such as pines and rimu. Chilocarpus species have small, white or greenish flowers and produce berries that are an important food source for native birds. The genus is characterized by its unique ecological role in New Zealand's forests."
