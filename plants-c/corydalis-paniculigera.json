    "intro": "Corydalis paniculigera, commonly known as the panicled corydalis, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fumariaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in woodland and rocky habitats. The plant produces delicate, clustered flowers in shades of pink and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a hairy stem that distinguishes it from similar species. Corydalis paniculigera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and fragrance."
