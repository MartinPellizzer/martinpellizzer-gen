    "intro": "Carex extensa var. ecklonii, commonly known as the Ecklon's sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is native to southern Africa and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
