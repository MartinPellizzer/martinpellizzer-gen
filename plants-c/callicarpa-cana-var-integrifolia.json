    "intro": "Callicarpa cana var. integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, violet-blue berries that appear in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth margin, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Callicarpa. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. The plant is also valued for its fragrant foliage and ability to attract birds and other wildlife."
