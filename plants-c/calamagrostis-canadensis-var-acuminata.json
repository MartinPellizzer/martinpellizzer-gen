    "intro": "Calamagrostis canadensis var. acuminata, commonly known as Canadian feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, silver-green foliage and feathery plumes that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often lined with fine hairs, and its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
