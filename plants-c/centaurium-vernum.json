    "intro": "Centaurium vernum, commonly known as spring centaury, is a small herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. These flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Centaurium vernum is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
