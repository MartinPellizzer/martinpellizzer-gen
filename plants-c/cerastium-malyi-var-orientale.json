    "intro": "Cerastium malyi var. orientale, commonly known as the oriental mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to Central Asia. It features small, oval leaves that are densely packed and covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates."
