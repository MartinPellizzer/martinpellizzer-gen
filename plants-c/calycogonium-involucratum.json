    "intro": "Calycogonium involucratum, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and showy, clustered flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb, often with a short, stout stem. Its flowers are zygomorphic, meaning they are bilaterally symmetrical, and are borne on short pedicels. The leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, which is an adaptation to its native arid environment."
