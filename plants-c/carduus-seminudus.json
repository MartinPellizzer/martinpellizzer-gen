    "intro": "Carduus seminudus, commonly known as the naked thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, and the flowers are arranged in a single, terminal head. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
