It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
