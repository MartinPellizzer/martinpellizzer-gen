    "intro": "Centaurea kunkelii, commonly known as Kunkel's cornflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its bright blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, and it produces slender, bristly seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Centaurea kunkelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and hardy nature."
