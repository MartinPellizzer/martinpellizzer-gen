    "intro": "Chaetogastra alpestris, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that help it withstand cold and windy conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Chaetogastra alpestris plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
