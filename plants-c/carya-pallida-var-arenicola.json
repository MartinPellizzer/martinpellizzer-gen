    "intro": "Carya pallida var. arenicola, commonly known as the sandpost oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the sandy soils of the southeastern United States. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It is adapted to well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
