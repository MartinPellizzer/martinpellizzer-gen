    "intro": "Capparis lasiopoda, commonly known as the rough caper, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are usually thick and have a rough texture, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. The species is part of the Capparaceae family, known for its distinctive floral structures and ecological adaptations."
