    "intro": "Cirsium leo, commonly known as the lion's thorn, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and dark green, lobed leaves. The plant produces showy purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its ornamental value and invasive tendencies in some regions, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires careful management."
