    "intro": "Cynorkis compacta, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a compact, terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near water sources such as rivers and swamps. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with a few leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Its flowers are usually clustered in a spike and bloom during the wet season. Cynorkis compacta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
