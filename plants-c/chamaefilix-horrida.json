    "intro": "Chamaefilix horrida, commonly known as the rough chamaefilix, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant's leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Chamaefilix horrida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and drought tolerance."
