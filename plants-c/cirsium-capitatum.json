    "intro": "Cirsium capitatum, commonly known as the purple thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and dense, purple-blue flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant features deeply lobed, silvery-green leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically composed of both ray and disk florets, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Cirsium capitatum is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
