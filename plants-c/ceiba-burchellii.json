    "intro": "Ceiba burchellii, commonly known as the African ceiba, is a large, fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its buttressed roots, which help stabilize it in shallow soils, and its massive, umbrella-shaped crown. The tree produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its wide distribution. The bark and leaves of Ceiba burchellii have been used in traditional medicine for their potential healing properties."
