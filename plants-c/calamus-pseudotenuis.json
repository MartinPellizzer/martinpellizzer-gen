    "intro": "Calamus pseudotenuis, commonly known as the slender calamus, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is a climbing palm with long, thin stems that often grow along the ground or on other plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by elongated, spiny fruits. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, contributing to its overall grass-like appearance. Calamus pseudotenuis is valued in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
