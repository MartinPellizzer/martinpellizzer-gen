    "intro": "Centaurea rupicola, commonly known as the rock centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is often found growing on rocky slopes and gravelly soils. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Centaurea rupicola is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
