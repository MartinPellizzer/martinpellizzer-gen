    "intro": "Cleyera japonica var. parvifolia, commonly known as Japanese holly or small-leaved cleyera, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Native to Japan and Korea, it thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
