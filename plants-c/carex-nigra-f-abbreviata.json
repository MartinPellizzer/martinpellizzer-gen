    "intro": "Carex nigra f. abbreviata, commonly known as black sedge. It is a compact, low-growing sedge with dark green, narrow leaves that are shorter than the typical variety. The plant produces spikes of small, dark brown flowers in late summer, which are clustered closely together. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This form is often used in wetland gardens and as a ground cover in shaded areas."
