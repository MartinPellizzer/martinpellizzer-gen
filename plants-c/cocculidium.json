    "intro": "Cocculidium, commonly known as the bladder campion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble bladders, giving the plant its common name. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that are often pink or white. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Cocculidium species are generally herbaceous and can be annual or perennial, depending on the species."
