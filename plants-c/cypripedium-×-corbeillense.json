    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 corbeillense, commonly known as the Corbeillense lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, typically pink or white in color. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears a single flower, which is often adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
