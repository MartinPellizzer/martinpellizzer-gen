    "intro": "Crataegus meiophylla, commonly known as the whiteleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its white to pale green leaves, which distinguish it from other hawthorn species. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Crataegus meiophylla is often found in woodlands and along streambanks, contributing to local biodiversity."
