It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
