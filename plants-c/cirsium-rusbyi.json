    "intro": "Cirsium rusbyi, commonly known as Rusby's thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and large, purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cirsium rusbyi is often found in regions with well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
