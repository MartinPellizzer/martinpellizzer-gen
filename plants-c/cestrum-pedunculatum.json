    "intro": "Cestrum pedunculatum, commonly known as the night-blooming jasmine, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but often contain toxic seeds. Its flowers open at night, releasing a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Cestrum pedunculatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking nighttime blooms."
