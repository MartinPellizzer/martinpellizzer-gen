    "intro": "Castanea sativa f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated sweet chestnut, is a cultivar of the sweet chestnut tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive variegated foliage, featuring white and green patterns on its leaves, which make it a popular ornamental plant. The tree produces edible nuts similar to those of the standard sweet chestnut, though the fruit may be smaller and less abundant. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic value."
