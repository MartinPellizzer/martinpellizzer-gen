    "intro": "Cypripedium macranthos var. tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-shaped lip, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
