    "intro": "Conocliniopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Conocliniopsis is considered critically endangered and is protected in its native range."
