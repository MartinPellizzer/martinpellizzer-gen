It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in racemes, often with two lobes on each petal. The leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This species is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and possesses nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas."
