    "intro": "Cytisus volubilis, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters, characterized by its woody stems and dense, sprawling growth habit. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are small, trifoliate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall appearance. Cytisus volubilis is adapted to well-drained soils and can thrive in sunny, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
