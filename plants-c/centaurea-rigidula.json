    "intro": "Centaurea rigidula, commonly known as rigid centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Centaurea rigidula is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
