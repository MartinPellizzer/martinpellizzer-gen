    "intro": "Chamaesyce parishii, commonly known as the Parish's sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically forms a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Chamaesyce parishii is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in full sun and drought conditions."
