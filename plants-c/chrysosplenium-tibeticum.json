    "intro": "Chrysosplenium tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan chrysosplenium, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant has opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological role, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
