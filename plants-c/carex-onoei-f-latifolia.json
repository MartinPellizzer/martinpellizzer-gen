    "intro": "Carex onoei f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sedges, is a variant of the Carex onoei species, characterized by its broader, more robust leaves compared to the typical form. It is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family, commonly found in moist, temperate environments such as wetlands and marshes. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers, which are typical of the sedge family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems. Carex onoei f. latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
