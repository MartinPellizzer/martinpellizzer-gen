    "intro": "Carya \u00d7 dunbarii, commonly known as the Dunbar hickory, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Carya cordiformis (bitternut hickory) and Carya ovata (shagbark hickory). It is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States, characterized by its compound leaves and edible, sweet nuts. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by the development of its distinctive hickory nuts in the fall. Its bark is thick and ridged, providing a rugged appearance, while its wood is valued for its strength and durability."
