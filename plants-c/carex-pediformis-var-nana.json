    "intro": "Carex pediformis var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf basket sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy, forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer, adding subtle floral interest. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for wetland gardens and naturalized landscapes."
