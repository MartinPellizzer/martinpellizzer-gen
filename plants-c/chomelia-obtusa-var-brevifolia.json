It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring lance-shaped leaves that are shorter and broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a distinct floral structure. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories or along stream banks."
