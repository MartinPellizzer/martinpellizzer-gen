    "intro": "Cyrtandra urdanetensis, commonly known as the Urdanet mountain heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Ecuador. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
