    "intro": "Chromolaena collina, commonly known as the creeping chromolaena, is a tropical perennial plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its spreading growth habit and pairs of opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, cotton-like seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and abandoned fields, due to its adaptability and rapid growth. Chromolaena collina is also known for its allelopathic properties, which can inhibit the growth of other plants around it."
