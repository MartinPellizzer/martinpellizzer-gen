    "intro": "Cissus repens var. sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese rock ivy, is a climbing or trailing plant native to China. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Its ability to climb and trail makes it suitable for hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
