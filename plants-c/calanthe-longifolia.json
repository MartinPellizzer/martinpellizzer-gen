    "intro": "Calanthe longifolia, commonly known as the long-flowered calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizome and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its elegant appearance."
