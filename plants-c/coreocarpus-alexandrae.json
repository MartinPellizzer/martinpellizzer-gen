    "intro": "Coreocarpus alexandrae, commonly known as Alexandra's coreocarpus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its unique, woody structure and intricate floral morphology. The plant typically grows in coastal or rocky habitats, where it exhibits adaptations to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors, and it produces distinctive, woody fruits known as coreocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
