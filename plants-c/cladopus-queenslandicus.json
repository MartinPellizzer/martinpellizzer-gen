    "intro": "Cladopus queenslandicus, commonly known as the Queensland thornbush, is a shrub native to the tropical and subtropical regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes during the warmer months, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Cladopus queenslandicus plays an important role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
