    "intro": "Chaetoseris pectiniformis, commonly known as the woolly dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly coating on its stems and leaves, which provides protection against herbivores and water loss. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
