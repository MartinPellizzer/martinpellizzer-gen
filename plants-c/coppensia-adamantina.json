    "intro": "Coppensia adamantina, commonly known as the rigid swamp orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, spurred orchid flowers in shades of pink and white. It thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in areas with rich, organic soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
