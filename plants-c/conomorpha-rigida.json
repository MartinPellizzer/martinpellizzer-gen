    "intro": "Conomorpha rigida, commonly known as the rigid conomorpha, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its woody stems and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a typical feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Conomorpha rigida is native to parts of Africa and is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils."
