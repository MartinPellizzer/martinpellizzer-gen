It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and tufted inflorescences, which give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and slightly curved, with a prominent midrib. Velvet grass is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and drought tolerance."
