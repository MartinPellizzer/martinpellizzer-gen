    "intro": "Calandrinia rubrisabulosa, commonly known as the red sand mat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its succulent, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Calandrinia rubrisabulosa is well adapted to sandy soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
