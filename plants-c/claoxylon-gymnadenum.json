    "intro": "Claoxylon gymnadenum, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It has a straight, cylindrical trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exfoliates in thin, flaky layers. The plant features lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are borne in clusters and are followed by small, round, woody fruits. The tree is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and for making incense."
