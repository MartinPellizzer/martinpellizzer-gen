    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 doliare, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium guttatum. It is characterized by its distinctive pouch-shaped lip, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in temperate regions of Asia. Its flowers are usually pink or white with a greenish throat, and it produces showy, fragrant blooms in late spring. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
