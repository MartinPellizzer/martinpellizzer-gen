    "intro": "Costularia nervosa, commonly known as the slender false nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with prominent veins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Costularia nervosa thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
