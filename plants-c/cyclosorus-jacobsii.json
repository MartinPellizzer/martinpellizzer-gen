    "intro": "Cyclosorus jacobsii, commonly known as the Jacob's shield fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rich, humusy soils along stream banks and in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
