    "intro": "Coelogyne mandarinorum, commonly known as the Mandarin orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which resemble citrus fruits, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. The flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat."
