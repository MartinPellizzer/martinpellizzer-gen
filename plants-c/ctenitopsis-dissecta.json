    "intro": "Ctenitopsis dissecta, commonly known as the dissected ctenitopsis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a finely dissected margin, giving it a feathery appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
