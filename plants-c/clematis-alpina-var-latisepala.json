    "intro": "Clematis alpina var. latisepala, commonly known as the broad-sepaled clematis, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers with five broad sepals and a distinctive, elongated style. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a climbing plant. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice among gardeners."
