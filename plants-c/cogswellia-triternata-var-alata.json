    "intro": "Cogswellia triternata var. alata, commonly known as the winged cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in soft, white spines. The plant typically grows in a shrub-like form, with the stems branching out in a triangular pattern. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
