    "intro": "Centroglossa, commonly known as the \"tongue-shaped orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure that resembles a tongue, hence its common name. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. Centroglossa species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks. Their flowers are usually small, colorful, and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
