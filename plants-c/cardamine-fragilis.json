    "intro": "Cardamine fragilis, commonly known as brittle watercress, is a small, delicate flowering plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It belongs to the Buttercup family (Ranunculaceae) and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet soils along stream banks, marshes, and other damp habitats. It has a short growing season and is often found in areas with cool, temperate climates. Due to its fragile stems and leaves, it is easily damaged, which contributes to its common name."
