    "intro": "Centrosema latidens, commonly known as broadleaf desmodium, is a leguminous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three broad, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by pod fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often used as a forage crop due to its nutritional value. Centrosema latidens also has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility."
