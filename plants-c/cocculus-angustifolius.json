    "intro": "Cocculus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf devil's backbone, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, twisting stems and heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by spiny, orange-red berries. Its fruit contains a single, hard, angular seed, which is often used in traditional medicine. The plant's botanical features make it easily identifiable and notable in its native habitats."
