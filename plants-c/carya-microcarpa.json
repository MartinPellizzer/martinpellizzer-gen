    "intro": "Carya microcarpa, commonly known as the littleleaf hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the walnut family, Juglandaceae, and is characterized by its small, oval leaves and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which are typically harvested in the fall. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in moist bottomlands and along streams. Carya microcarpa is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also important for wildlife habitat and ecological diversity."
