    "intro": "Campanula napuligera var. arcuata, commonly known as the curved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems. This variety is distinguished by its curved flower stems, which give it its specific epithet \"arcuata.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
