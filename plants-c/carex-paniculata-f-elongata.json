    "intro": "Carex paniculata f. elongata, commonly known as the elongated sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spike-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. The elongated leaves and compact growth habit make it a valuable plant for wetland restoration and ornamental gardening."
