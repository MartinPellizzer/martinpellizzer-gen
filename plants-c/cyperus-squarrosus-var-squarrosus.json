    "intro": "Cyperus squarrosus var. squarrosus, commonly known as the hairy flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in disturbed soils near water bodies. The plant has slender, triangular stems with numerous branches and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. This species is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
