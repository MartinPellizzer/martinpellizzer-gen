    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 heterophyta, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a natural hybrid between Carex acutata and Carex lyngbyei, characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, three-rowed berries. Carex \u00d7 heterophyta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
