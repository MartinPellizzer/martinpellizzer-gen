    "intro": "Ctenitis lanuginosa, commonly known as the silky fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with numerous small, overlapping pinnae that create a lush, dense foliage. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in botanical studies."
