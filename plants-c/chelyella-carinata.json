    "intro": "Chelyella carinata, commonly known as the ridge-leaf fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed fronds that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving water and prefers muddy or sandy substrates. Its rhizomes are often buried in the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. Chelyella carinata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling."
