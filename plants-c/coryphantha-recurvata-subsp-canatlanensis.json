It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically covered in dense clusters of spines. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruits are fleshy and edible, though they are typically consumed by wildlife rather than humans. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils."
