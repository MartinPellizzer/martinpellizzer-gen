    "intro": "Cuatresia foreroi, commonly known as the Forero's cuatresia, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cuatresia foreroi is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
