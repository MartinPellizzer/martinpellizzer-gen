It features slender, arching branches that cascade with clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant has leathery, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping and as a hedging plant."
