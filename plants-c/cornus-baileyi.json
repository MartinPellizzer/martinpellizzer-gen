    "intro": "Cornus baileyi, commonly known as Bailey's dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cornaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces bright red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds. Its ornamental value comes from its showy bracts and attractive foliage, making it a popular choice for gardens. Cornus baileyi thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade."
