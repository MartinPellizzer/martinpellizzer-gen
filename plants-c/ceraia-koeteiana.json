    "intro": "Ceraia koeteiana, commonly known as the Halmahera orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Halmahera Islands in Indonesia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its small size and limited distribution make it highly vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes. Due to its rarity, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
