    "intro": "Canna miniata, commonly known as the dwarf canna, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It features bold, sword-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a reddish or purple underside. The plant produces showy, spathaceous flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom in late summer. Canna miniata thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining, fertile soil. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to add vibrant color to landscapes."
