    "intro": "Cirsium winkleri, commonly known as Winkler's thistle, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands. Its leaves are covered in dense, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
