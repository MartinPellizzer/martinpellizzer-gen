    "intro": "Clematis scabiosifolia, commonly known as the scabious-leaved clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring a sturdy support structure for its vigorous growth. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, flowering vine."
