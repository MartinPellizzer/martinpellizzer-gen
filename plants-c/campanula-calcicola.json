    "intro": "Campanula calcicola, commonly known as the limestone bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to regions with calcareous soils. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, thriving in well-drained, alkaline conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branching. Campanula calcicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
