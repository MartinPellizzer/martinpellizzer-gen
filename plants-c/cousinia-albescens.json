    "intro": "Cousinia albescens, commonly known as the whiteflower globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Cousinia albescens is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, semi-arid climates."
