    "intro": "Cypripedium longifolium var. hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or purple flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination mechanism. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and meadows, often in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, elongated flower stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
