    "intro": "Calamus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf calamus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Aroid family (Araceae) and is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically enclosed within a spadix, a common feature among aroids. Calamus pumilus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or wetlands. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its humid, low-light habitat."
