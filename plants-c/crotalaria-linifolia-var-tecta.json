    "intro": "Crotalaria linifolia var. tecta, commonly known as the velvetleaf crotalaria, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its smooth, velvety foliage and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a branching structure with alternate leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. It thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to produce a large number of seeds, it can become a weed in cultivated areas."
