    "intro": "Carex heterodoxa, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Carex heterodoxa produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often borne on tall, slender stalks. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
