    "intro": "Ceuthostoma terminale, commonly known as the golden stripe minnow, is a small freshwater fish native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Cyprinidae and is characterized by its slender body and distinctive golden stripe running along its sides. The plant-like appearance of its scales and the way it interacts with aquatic vegetation make it a notable species in its habitat. It typically inhabits slow-moving streams and rivers with sandy or muddy substrates. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often studied for its contribution to aquatic ecosystems."
