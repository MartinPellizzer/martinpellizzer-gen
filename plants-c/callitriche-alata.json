    "intro": "Callitriche alata, commonly known as the winged water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often floating or partially submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are usually oval or lance-shaped. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale green, and appear in clusters near the water surface. Callitriche alata is often found in still or slow-moving water, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats."
