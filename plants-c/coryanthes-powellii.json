    "intro": "Coryanthes powellii, commonly known as the Powell's hooded orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its large, hood-like floral structure that encloses the reproductive organs, a feature typical of many coryanthes species. The plant produces vibrant, colorful flowers that range from red to orange, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Coryanthes powellii is a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of interest for both botanists and conservationists."
