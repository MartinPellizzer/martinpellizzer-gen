    "intro": "Carex dufourei, commonly known as the Dufour's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to parts of Asia, particularly China, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. Carex dufourei is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
