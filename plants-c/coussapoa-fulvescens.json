    "intro": "Coussapoa fulvescens, commonly known as the golden bromeliad, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking orange-red flowers that bloom in the spring, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, which help to retain moisture in the humid environment. Coussapoa fulvescens is typically grown as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
