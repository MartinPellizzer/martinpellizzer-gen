    "intro": "Croton lithrifolius, commonly known as the rock croton, is a shrub native to the rocky regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or yellowish in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Croton lithrifolius is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive foliage."
