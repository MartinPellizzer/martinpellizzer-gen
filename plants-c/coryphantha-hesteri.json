    "intro": "Coryphantha hesteri, commonly known as Hester's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing plant with a cluster of cylindrical stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Coryphantha hesteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils."
