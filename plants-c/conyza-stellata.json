    "intro": "Conyza stellata, commonly known as starry conyza, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa, South America, and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its seeds are tiny, wind-dispersed, and often found in disturbed soils. Conyza stellata is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
