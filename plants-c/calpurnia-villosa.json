    "intro": "Calpurnia villosa, commonly known as the hairy calpurnia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by elongated, woody pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as savannas and woodland edges. Calpurnia villosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
