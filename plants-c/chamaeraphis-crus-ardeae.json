    "intro": "Chamaeraphis crus-ardeae, commonly known as the red sandreed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it thrive in saline environments. Chamaeraphis crus-ardeae is well adapted to coastal and arid conditions, making it a hardy ornamental and ecological plant."
