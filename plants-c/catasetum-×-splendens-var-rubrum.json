It is characterized by its striking, velvety red flowers with a contrasting yellow lip, which are highly ornamental and attract specific pollinators. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. It produces a single, showy inflorescence with numerous flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical classification highlights its hybrid origin, combining traits from Catasetum splendens and other related species."
