    "intro": "Calamagrostis distantiflora, commonly known as the distant-flowered reed, is a perennial grass native to parts of Asia and North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, blade-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are spaced apart, giving it its characteristic \"distant-flowered\" appearance. Calamagrostis distantiflora is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
