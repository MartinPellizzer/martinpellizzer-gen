    "intro": "Colladoa monostachya, commonly known as the single-stemmed grass, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a single spike, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for ecological restoration projects."
