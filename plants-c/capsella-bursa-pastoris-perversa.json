It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, round seeds enclosed in a distinctive bur-like structure. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in many temperate regions."
