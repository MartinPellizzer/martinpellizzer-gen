It is characterized by its vibrant, multicolored leaves that range from bright green to red, orange, and yellow, often with intricate patterns. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is valued for its unique foliage rather than its flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is popular in horticulture for indoor and outdoor ornamental purposes."
