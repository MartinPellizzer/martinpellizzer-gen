    "intro": "Cuscuta potosina var. globifera, commonly known as the globeflower dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found parasitizing plants in the genus Passiflora. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years. The botanical significance of Cuscuta potosina var. globifera lies in its unique parasitic lifestyle and its role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
