    "intro": "Cyrtandra subcalva, commonly known as the Hawaiian cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which are borne in clusters at the leaf axils. Cyrtandra subcalva is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky areas. It is an important component of Hawaii's native flora and is considered a keystone species in certain ecosystems."
