    "intro": "Clypeola ciliata, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features a compact, upright growth habit with distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant's fronds are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Clypeola ciliata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for indoor and shaded garden settings."
