    "intro": "Cola johnsonii, commonly known as the African cola tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that develop into hard, woody pods containing caffeine-rich seeds. The seeds are used to make cola nuts, which are valued for their flavor and stimulant properties. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
