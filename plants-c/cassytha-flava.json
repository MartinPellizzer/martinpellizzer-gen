    "intro": "Cassytha flava, commonly known as the golden dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true roots and chlorophyll. It attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to absorb nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it can significantly weaken the host plant. Cassytha flava is an example of a hemiparasitic species that plays a role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
