    "intro": "Caragana kozlowii, commonly known as the Siberian peashrub, is a deciduous shrub native to central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of leaflets, and its yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces legume pods containing seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often used in reclamation projects due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen. Its botanical features make it an important species in arid and semi-arid regions."
