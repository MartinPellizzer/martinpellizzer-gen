    "intro": "Codonopsis rotundifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed chicken's foot, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It features a short, hairy stem with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically narrow and have a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Codonopsis rotundifolia."
