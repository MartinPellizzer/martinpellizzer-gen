It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds. The plant has a robust rhizome system that supports its growth in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark. Cyathea trichodesma plays an important ecological role in tropical rainforests, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various organisms."
