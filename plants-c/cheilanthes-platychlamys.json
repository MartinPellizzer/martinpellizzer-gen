    "intro": "Cheilanthes platychlamys, commonly known as the broad-leaved rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its robust, evergreen fronds that are typically broad and leathery, adapting well to arid and rocky environments. The plant is native to regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in limestone soils and rocky crevices. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Cheilanthes platychlamys is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
