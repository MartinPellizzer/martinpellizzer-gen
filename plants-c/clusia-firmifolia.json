    "intro": "Clusia firmifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf glorybower, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a smooth, leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are borne in terminal panicles, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its adaptability to various soil types and drought tolerance make it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. Clusia firmifolia is also valued for its ability to thrive in shaded to partially sunny conditions."
