It features upright, branching stems that are usually hairy and can grow up to 1 meter tall. The plant produces purple to reddish flowers with dark centers, surrounded by ray florets that are typically white or pale pink. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated edges, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Black knapweed is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is known for its adaptability to various environmental conditions."
