    "intro": "Crocus alatavicus var. albus, commonly known as the white alatavian crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, often fragrant scent. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and is adapted to cold, arid climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
