    "intro": "Cupressus goveniana var. abramsiana, commonly known as the Arizona cypress, is a deciduous conifer native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that turn a striking copper color in the fall. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by woody cones that release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental tree. Its slow growth rate and drought tolerance make it suitable for xeriscaping in arid landscapes."
