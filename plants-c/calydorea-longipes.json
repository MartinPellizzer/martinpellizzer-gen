    "intro": "Calydorea longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed calydorea, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and delicate, fern-like leaves that give it an elegant appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental value. Native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calydorea longipes is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
