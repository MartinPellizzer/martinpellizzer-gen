    "intro": "Coleus montanus, commonly known as the mountain coleus, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage rather than showy flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with opposite, ovate leaves that vary in color from green to red, purple, and yellow. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value is primarily due to its striking leaf patterns, which can enhance the visual appeal of both indoor and outdoor spaces."
