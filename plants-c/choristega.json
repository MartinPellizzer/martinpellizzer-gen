    "intro": "Choristega, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. Choristega is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water availability."
