    "intro": "Cyrtandra megistocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered cyrtandra, is a member of the Campanulaceae family. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
