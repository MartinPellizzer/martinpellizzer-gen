    "intro": "Chenolea tridens, commonly known as the three-toothed fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Chenolea tridens plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
