    "intro": "Cassia alcaparilla, commonly known as Spanish needle, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, slightly hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces slender, needle-like pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cassia alcaparilla is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun. Its botanical features make it a common weed in arid and semi-arid environments."
