    "intro": "Carex lanceolata, commonly known as narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinct midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually borne on slender, unbranched stems. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Carex lanceolata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
