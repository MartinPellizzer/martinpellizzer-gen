    "intro": "Cyrtandra panayensis, commonly known as the Panay piper. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family, native to the island of Panay in the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often clustered in inflorescences.
