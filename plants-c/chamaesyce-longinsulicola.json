    "intro": "Chamaesyce longinsulicola, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its unique floral structures and milky sap. The plant typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils, often in coastal or inland dune environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Chamaesyce longinsulicola produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or yellowish, with a distinctive cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family."
