    "intro": "Carex sismanii, commonly known as Sisman's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It has triangular stems and produces spike-like inflorescences with small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex sismanii is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
