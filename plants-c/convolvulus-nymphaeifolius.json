It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to southern Africa and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its climbing habit and rapid growth make it both ornamental and potentially invasive in certain regions. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and can be found in wetlands and along stream banks."
