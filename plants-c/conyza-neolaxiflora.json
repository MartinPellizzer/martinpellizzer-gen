    "intro": "Conyza neolaxiflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf horseweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in open areas such as roadsides and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its small, white to yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Conyza neolaxiflora is often considered a weed but has ecological significance in supporting pollinators."
