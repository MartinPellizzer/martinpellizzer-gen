    "intro": "Carex pedunculata subsp. erythrobasis, commonly known as the red-stem sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive reddish stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant produces small, clustered flower spikes that are typically green or brown, and it is often found in wet or moist environments such as marshes and stream banks. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
