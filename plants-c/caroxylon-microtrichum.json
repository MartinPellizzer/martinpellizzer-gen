    "intro": "Caroxylon microtrichum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, short hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Caroxylon microtrichum is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
