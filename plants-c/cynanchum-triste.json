    "intro": "Cynanchum triste, commonly known as black swallowwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and showy, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits called follicles, which contain seeds with a silky appendage that aids in wind dispersal. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and challenging to manage in natural habitats."
