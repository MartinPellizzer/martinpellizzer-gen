It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, round fruits that contain a single seed. Canarium robustum is valued for its oil-rich nuts, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of biofuel. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various wildlife species in its native range."
