    "intro": "Cyperorchis wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan marsh orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including India, Nepal, and Bhutan, where it thrives in wetlands and marshy habitats. The plant is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces delicate, orchid-like flowers with a distinctive purple or pink hue. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its growth is closely associated with moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
