    "intro": "Cogswellia macrocarpa var. artemisiarum, commonly known as the Artemisia-leaved Cogswellia, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of Artemisia species, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
