    "intro": "Crossotropis eleusinoides, commonly known as the African grass or elephant grass, is a tall, perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its coarse, fibrous leaves and can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and form dense stands. It is often used for forage, erosion control, and in traditional medicine."
