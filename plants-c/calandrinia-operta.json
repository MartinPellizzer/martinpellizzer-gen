    "intro": "Calandrinia operta, commonly known as the desert geranium, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces vibrant pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Calandrinia operta is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
