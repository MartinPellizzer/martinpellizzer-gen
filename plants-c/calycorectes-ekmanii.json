    "intro": "Calycorectes ekmanii, commonly known as the Kerguelen cabbage, is a flowering plant native to the subantarctic islands of the Kerguelen archipelago. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many edible and economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to the harsh, cold climate of its natural habitat. Calycorectes ekmanii is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
