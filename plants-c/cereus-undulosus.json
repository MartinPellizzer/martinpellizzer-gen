    "intro": "Cereus undulosus, commonly known as the wavy candle cactus, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its growth habit is typically upright, and it can reach heights of up to 6 feet. Cereus undulosus is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
