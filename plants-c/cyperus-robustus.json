It is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in three rows. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often with a distinctive three-lobed bract. Cyperus robustus is often found in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. It is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
