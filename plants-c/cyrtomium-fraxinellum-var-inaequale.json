    "intro": "Cyrtomium fraxinellum var. inaequale, commonly known as the unequal holly fern, is a variant of the fraxinella holly fern. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or rocky areas. This variant is notable for its unique leaf morphology, which distinguishes it from other members of the Cyrtomium genus."
