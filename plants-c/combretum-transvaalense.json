    "intro": "Combretum transvaalense, commonly known as the Natal flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers that appear in clusters during the late summer and autumn. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types."
