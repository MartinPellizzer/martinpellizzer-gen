    "intro": "Cyphia oligotricha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Cyphia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
