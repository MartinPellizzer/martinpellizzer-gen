It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance. Centaurium erythraea is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils."
