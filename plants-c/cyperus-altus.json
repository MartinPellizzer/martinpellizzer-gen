    "intro": "Cyperus altus, commonly known as the tall flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along pond edges. Cyperus altus has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in wet habitats. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
