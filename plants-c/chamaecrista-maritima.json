    "intro": "Chamaecrista maritima, commonly known as sea bean, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant produces small, yellow-orange pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small leaflets, and it has a distinctive seed pod that splits open when mature. Chamaecrista maritima is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
