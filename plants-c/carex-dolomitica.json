    "intro": "Carex dolomitica, commonly known as the dolomite sedge, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and reeds, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are clustered in dense, cylindrical structures, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex dolomitica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environments."
