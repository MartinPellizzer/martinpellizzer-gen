    "intro": "Cactus stramineus, commonly known as the white cactus or the woolly cactus, is a species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. Its roots are shallow and widespread, allowing it to quickly absorb rainwater during brief rainfall events. Cactus stramineus is well adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with minimal water and nutrients."
