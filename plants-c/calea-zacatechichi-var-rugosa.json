    "intro": "Calea zacatechichi var. rugosa, commonly known as the Mexican ghost flower, is a striking ornamental plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, waxy, white bracts that resemble ghostly faces, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soil and full sun. Its foliage is hairy and has a textured, rugose appearance, giving it its varietal name. It is often cultivated for its dramatic visual impact in gardens and is also used in traditional medicine."
