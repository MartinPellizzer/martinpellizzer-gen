    "intro": "Caralluma adscendens var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that grow upright, often branching at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, a feature common in xerophytic plants. This species is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
