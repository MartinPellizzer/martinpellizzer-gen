    "intro": "Cyphia pinnata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, narrow segments that create a finely divided look. Cyphia pinnata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
