    "intro": "Commiphora orbicularis, commonly known as the African gum tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Burseraceae family. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is known for secreting a resinous gum from its bark. This gum has been used traditionally for its aromatic properties and medicinal applications. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
