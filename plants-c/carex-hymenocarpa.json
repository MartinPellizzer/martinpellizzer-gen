    "intro": "Carex hymenocarpa, commonly known as the woolly sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikelets that are often covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its botanical features include triangular stems and small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex hymenocarpa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
