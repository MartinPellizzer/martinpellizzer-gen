    "intro": "Cerastium campanulatum, commonly known as the bell-shaped chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has hairy, upright stems and opposite, spoon-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and garden beds. Cerastium campanulatum is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ability to spread easily through stolons."
