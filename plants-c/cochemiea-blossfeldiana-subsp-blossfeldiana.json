    "intro": "Cochemiea blossfeldiana subsp. blossfeldiana, commonly known as the Blossfeld's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with a branching structure that forms dense clusters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and early summer, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The subspecies is noted for its ability to form large clumps over time, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
