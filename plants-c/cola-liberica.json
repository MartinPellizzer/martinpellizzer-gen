    "intro": "Cola liberica, commonly known as West African cola, is a species of the genus Cola native to western and central Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing several seeds. The seeds, often referred to as \"cola nuts,\" are the primary part used in the production of cola beverages and have a bitter, stimulant-rich flavor. Cola liberica is closely related to Cola acuminata and is one of the main species used in commercial cola production."
