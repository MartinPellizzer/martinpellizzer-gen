    "intro": "Columnea mortonii, commonly known as the Morton's flame plant, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are slender and somewhat trailing. Columnea mortonii is valued in horticulture for its vibrant flowers and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
