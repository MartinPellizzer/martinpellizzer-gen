    "intro": "Carex binerviformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedges, is a species of sedge native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has fibrous roots and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex binerviformis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
