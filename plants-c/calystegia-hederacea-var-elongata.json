It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. The plant produces a trailing or climbing growth habit, with hairy stems that can reach several meters in length. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in many regions."
