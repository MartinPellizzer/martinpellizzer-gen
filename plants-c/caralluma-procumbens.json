    "intro": "Caralluma procumbens, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Australia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, spiny stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions. Caralluma procumbens is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
