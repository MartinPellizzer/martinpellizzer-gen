    "intro": "Coryphantha kieferiana, commonly known as the Kiefer's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in spines and are often green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is well adapted to arid environments. Coryphantha kieferiana is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
