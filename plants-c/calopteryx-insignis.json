    "intro": "Calopteryx insignis, commonly known as the common emerald damselfly, is a species of aquatic insect belonging to the family Coenagrionidae. It is characterized by its striking green coloration, which becomes more vibrant in direct sunlight. The adult damselfly has elongated, slender wings and a slender body, typically measuring around 35 to 45 millimeters in length. It is often found near still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The larvae, known as naiads, live in water and are important indicators of water quality due to their sensitivity to pollution."
