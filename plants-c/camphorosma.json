    "intro": "Camphorosma, commonly known as the camphorweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their woody stems and compound leaves. Camphorosma species produce small, pea-like flowers that are often yellow or greenish in color. These plants are adapted to harsh environments, with some species capable of surviving in poor soil conditions and drought."
