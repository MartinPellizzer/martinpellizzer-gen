    "intro": "Catapodium loliaceum, commonly known as the catapodium or the grass of the marshes, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Catapodium loliaceum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
