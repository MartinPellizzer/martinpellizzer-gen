It is a member of the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. Its leaves are glossy and lance-shaped, while its fruits are small, woody drupes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
