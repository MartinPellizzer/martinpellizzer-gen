    "intro": "Calamagrostis lanceolata var. montana, commonly known as the mountain bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It produces delicate, panicle-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated as a ornamental grass in landscaping."
