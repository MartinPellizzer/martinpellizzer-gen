    "intro": "Callobuxus, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to southern Africa and consists of several species, including Callobuxus capensis and Callobuxus quadrifida. These plants are characterized by their woody stems, opposite leaves, and showy, often fragrant flowers. The bark and latex of some species have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties. Callobuxus plants typically thrive in dry, sandy soils and are often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
