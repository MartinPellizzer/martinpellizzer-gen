    "intro": "Castilleja linariifolia var. filiformis, commonly known as the slenderleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red or orange floral bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on root connections to host plants for nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and meadows. Its delicate, thread-like foliage and showy flowers make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native range."
