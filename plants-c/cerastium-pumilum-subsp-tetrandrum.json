    "intro": "Cerastium pumilum subsp. tetrandrum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stems, often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers with four stamens, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its compact growth habit and frost resistance make it a characteristic component of alpine vegetation."
