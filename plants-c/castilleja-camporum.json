    "intro": "Castilleja camporum, commonly known as the Sierra foothill paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Castilleja camporum typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
