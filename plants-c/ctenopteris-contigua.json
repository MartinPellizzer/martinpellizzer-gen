    "intro": "Ctenopteris contigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea grape, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often used in horticultural settings for their ornamental value. The plant thrives in humid, coastal environments and is typically found growing in shallow marine areas or on rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Ctenopteris contigua plays a role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
