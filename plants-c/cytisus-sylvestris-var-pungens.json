It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being oval and hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats. This variety is distinguished by its rough, bristly texture, which gives it its common name."
