It is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters of three, giving it its common name. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are typically hairy on both surfaces. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a native, flowering shrub."
