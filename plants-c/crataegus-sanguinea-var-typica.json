It is characterized by its thorny stems, pinnately compound leaves, and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species in its native range."
