    "intro": "Commelina condensata, commonly known as the denseblume or swamp morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or light green underside, and produces small, blue or violet flowers with a white throat. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Commelina condensata is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator species for wetland habitats."
