    "intro": "Clidemia venosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Hawaiian velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in the spring and summer. Clidemia venosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets."
