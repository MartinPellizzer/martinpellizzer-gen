    "intro": "Crataegus saxatilis, commonly known as the saxatile hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves, and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in woodland edges or mountainous regions. Crataegus saxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wildlife."
