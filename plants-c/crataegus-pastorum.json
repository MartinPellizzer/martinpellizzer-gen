    "intro": "Crataegus pastorum, commonly known as the pasture hawthorn, is a species of shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters and features thorned branches, which are a characteristic feature of many hawthorn species. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in spring, followed by red or orange berries in the autumn. Its leaves are usually oval or elliptical with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in open woodlands, pastures, and disturbed soils. Crataegus pastorum is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential cardiovascular benefits."
