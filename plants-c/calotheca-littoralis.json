    "intro": "Calotheca littoralis, commonly known as the coastal green alga, is a marine species belonging to the family Ulvaceae. It is typically found in intertidal zones along rocky shores, where it thrives in brackish or slightly saline waters. The plant has a flat, lobed thallus that ranges in color from green to brown, depending on environmental conditions. It reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, producing zoospores that develop into new gametophytes. Calotheca littoralis plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
