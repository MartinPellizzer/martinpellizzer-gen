    "intro": "Collabium wrayi, commonly known as the Wray's collabium, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes a variety of flowering plants primarily found in southern Africa and Australia. The plant is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth form and features small, narrow leaves arranged in dense clusters. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in spike-like inflorescences, and are adapted to attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Collabium wrayi is considered a botanically significant species for ecological and conservation studies."
