    "intro": "Cerastium papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants known for their showy blooms. The plant features small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
