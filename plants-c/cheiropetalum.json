    "intro": "Cheiropetalum, commonly known as the \"hand-leaf\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. It is characterized by its unique, palmately lobed leaves that resemble human hands, giving it its common name. The plants typically have opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves, and they produce small, greenish flowers in clusters. Cheiropetalum species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are generally shade-tolerant and thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
