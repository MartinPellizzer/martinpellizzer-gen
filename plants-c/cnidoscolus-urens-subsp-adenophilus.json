    "intro": "Cnidoscolus urens subsp. adenophilus, commonly known as the Mexican arrowroot or arrowleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central America and northern South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring large, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by edible, starchy tubers that are a traditional food source. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to humid, tropical environments with well-drained soil. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger leaves and more robust growth compared to other members of the genus."
