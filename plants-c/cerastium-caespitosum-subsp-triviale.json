    "intro": "Cerastium caespitosum subsp. triviale, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces numerous tiny, elongated fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through stolons make it a common weed in gardens and disturbed soils."
