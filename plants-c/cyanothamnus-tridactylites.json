    "intro": "Cyanothamnus tridactylites, commonly known as the three-fingered bluebush, is a low-growing shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cyanothamnus tridactylites is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia."
