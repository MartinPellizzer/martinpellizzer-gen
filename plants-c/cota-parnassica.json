    "intro": "Cota parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian cota, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the European Alps. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Cota parnassica is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies for its anti-inflammatory effects."
