    "intro": "Cylindropuntia whipplei subsp. enodis, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color, with spines that vary in length and density. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. This species is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats."
