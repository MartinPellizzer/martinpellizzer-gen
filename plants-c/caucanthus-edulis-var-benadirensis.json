    "intro": "Caucanthus edulis var. benadirensis, commonly known as the Benadirensis variety of edible caucanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its edible leaves, which have a mild, nutty flavor, are traditionally used in local cuisines. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
