    "intro": "Ctenopteris matutumensis, commonly known as the morning fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing along forest floors or on rocky substrates. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the leaves. Ctenopteris matutumensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
