It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is notable for its adaptability to various aquatic environments and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
