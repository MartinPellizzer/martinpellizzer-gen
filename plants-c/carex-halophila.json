    "intro": "Carex halophila, commonly known as saltmarsh sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb that thrives in saline environments such as coastal wetlands and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color. It has adapted to tolerate high salt concentrations through specialized cellular structures and efficient water regulation. Carex halophila plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
