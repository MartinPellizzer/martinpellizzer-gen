It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a yellow or orange throat. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem that bears multiple blooms, making it a dramatic addition to gardens. Its leaves are broad, strap-like, and arranged in a rosette at the base. Crinum soboliferum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks."
