It is characterized by its daisy-like flowers, which typically have yellow centers and white to pale pink petals. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its widespread distribution. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and fields. Botanically, it is a tetraploid species resulting from the cross between Conyza canescens and Conyza bonariensis."
