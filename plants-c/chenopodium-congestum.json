    "intro": "Chenopodium congestum, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges and small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in small, inflated fruits that aid in wind dispersal. The plant is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
