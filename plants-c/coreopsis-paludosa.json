    "intro": "Coreopsis paludosa, commonly known as marsh coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, hairy stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, supporting clusters of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging wetland environments."
