    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 catherinae, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip, typically pink or red in color. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe and thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments. It has a short, thick rhizome and produces a single, erect stem with broad, ovate leaves. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and protected areas."
