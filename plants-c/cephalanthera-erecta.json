    "intro": "Cephalanthera erecta, commonly known as the erect lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that bears a dense, spiraled arrangement of pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a feature common among orchids, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Cephalanthera erecta is known for its delicate, fragrant blooms and is often considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
