    "intro": "Cereus tenuis, commonly known as the slender candle cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a low-growing, spiny cactus with a distinctive cylindrical shape and a ribbed structure. The plant produces white, night-blooming flowers that are often fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Cereus tenuis is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
