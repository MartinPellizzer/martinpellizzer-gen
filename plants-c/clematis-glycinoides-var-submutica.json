    "intro": "Clematis glycinoides var. submutica, commonly known as the velvetleaf clematis, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are woody and twining, allowing it to climb and spread vigorously. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
