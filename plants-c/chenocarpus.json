    "intro": "Chenocarpus, commonly known as the mangrove or sea hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas, especially in tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in saline or brackish water environments. Chenocarpus species are characterized by their woody structure, salt-excreting leaves, and specialized roots that help them anchor in soft, waterlogged soils. They play a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitats for various marine and terrestrial organisms. The genus includes several species, some of which are used for their ornamental value or in traditional medicine."
