    "intro": "Cnidoscolus lombardii, commonly known as the \"Lombardii arrowhead,\" is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically green and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, spiny fruits. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. However, the plant contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
