    "intro": "Clonodia ovata, commonly known as the oval leaf clonodia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and ovate-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its flowering period usually occurs during the warmer months, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Clonodia ovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
