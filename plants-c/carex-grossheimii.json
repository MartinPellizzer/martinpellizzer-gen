    "intro": "Carex grossheimii, commonly known as the Grossheim's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are usually wind-pollinated. Carex grossheimii is often found in shaded environments and can form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems."
