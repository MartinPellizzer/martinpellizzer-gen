It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, tubular flowers that typically range in color from white to pale blue. The plant is shrub-like, with woody stems and small, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
