    "intro": "Cynanchum megalanthum, commonly known as giant milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweeds, and is characterized by its showy, butterfly-shaped flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including mammals and birds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, while its stems are erect and can grow up to several meters in height. Cynanchum megalanthum plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though its toxicity limits its use in horticulture."
