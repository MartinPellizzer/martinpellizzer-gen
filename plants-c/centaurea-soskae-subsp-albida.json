    "intro": "Centaurea soskae subsp. albida, commonly known as the white centaury, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous growth habit and features narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with purple or reddish markings, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
