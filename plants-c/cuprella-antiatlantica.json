    "intro": "Cuprella antiatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic cupula, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean. It belongs to the family Cupulaceae and is characterized by its small, cup-shaped structures that serve as protective habitats for microorganisms. The plant thrives in humid, saline environments and is often found on rocky shores or in coastal dunes. Its morphology includes delicate, leaf-like structures that help in water retention and photosynthesis. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cuprella antiatlantica is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human activity."
