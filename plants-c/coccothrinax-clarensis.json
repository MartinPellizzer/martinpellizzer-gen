    "intro": "Coccothrinax clarensis, commonly known as the Clar\u00edn palm, is a species of palm native to the island of Hispaniola. It is characterized by its slender, tall trunk and pinnate leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by round, orange-colored fruits. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and windy conditions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas."
