    "intro": "Convolvulus spithamaeus subsp. purshianus, commonly known as the Pursh's bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open areas such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it both a useful forage plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
