It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its narrow leaves are usually bluish-green and have a rough texture. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to its natural environment."
