    "intro": "Cyperus cataractarum, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its unique, spiraling arrangement of leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other aquatic environments, thriving in moist or submerged conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Cyperus cataractarum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
