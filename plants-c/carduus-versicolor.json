    "intro": "Carduus versicolor, commonly known as the variable thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and striking purple to pink flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, and it produces achene seeds with pappus for wind dispersal. The species is noted for its variability in leaf shape and flower color, contributing to its common name."
