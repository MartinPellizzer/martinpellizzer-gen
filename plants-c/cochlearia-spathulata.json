    "intro": "Cochlearia spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaved mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and coastal areas. Cochlearia spathulata is also known for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to mustard greens."
