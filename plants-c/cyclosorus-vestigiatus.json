    "intro": "Cyclosorus vestigiatus, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the moist, shaded environments of tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, almost translucent fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in dense, humid forests, where it thrives in the understory with ample shade and consistent moisture. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Cyclosorus vestigiatus is often considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
