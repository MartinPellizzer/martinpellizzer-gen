    "intro": "Convolvulus meisneri f. albiflorus, commonly known as the whiteflower morning glory, is a variant of the species Convolvulus meisneri, characterized by its distinctive white or pale pink flowers. It is a climbing vine native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped blooms that open in the morning. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and can be found in various horticultural collections. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
