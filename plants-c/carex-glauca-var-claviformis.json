It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that ranges from blue-green to silver-gray in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water garden landscapes."
