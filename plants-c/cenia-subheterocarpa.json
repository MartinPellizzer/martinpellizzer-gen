    "intro": "Cenia subheterocarpa, commonly known as the variable-capsuled cenia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique capsule fruits that exhibit variations in shape and size, which is reflected in its scientific name. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces showy, pink or purple flowers. The botanical features of Cenia subheterocarpa make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and evolution."
