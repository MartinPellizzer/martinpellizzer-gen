    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis var. tremedalis, commonly known as the trembling watercress, is a delicate flowering plant native to wet meadows and marshy areas in Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and segmented leaves. The plant features basal rosettes of glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems rise above the foliage, bearing clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its preference for moist habitats, it is often found in regions with consistent groundwater or seasonal flooding."
