It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or white in color. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention.
