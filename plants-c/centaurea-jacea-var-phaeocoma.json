    "intro": "Centaurea jacea var. phaeocoma, commonly known as the dark-centred knapweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely hairy stems and striking, purple to pinkish-red flower heads. The flowers consist of a central disk surrounded by ray florets, which are typically a darker hue than the outer bracts. This variety is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening due to its visual appeal."
