    "intro": "Celmisia glandulosa var. vera, commonly known as the silver-tipped celmisia, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It features finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in dense, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
