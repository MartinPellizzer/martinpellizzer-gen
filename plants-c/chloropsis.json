    "intro": "Chloropsis, commonly known as the green ant. It is a genus of small, primitive flowering plants belonging to the family Chloranthaceae. These plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Chloropsis species are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. They play a minor role in ecological systems but are of interest to botanists due to their ancient lineage and unique morphological features."
