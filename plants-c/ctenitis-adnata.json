    "intro": "Ctenitis adnata, commonly known as the green shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a dense, overlapping arrangement of small, shield-shaped pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, fibrous sheath, which helps in water retention. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds."
