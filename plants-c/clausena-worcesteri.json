    "intro": "Clausena worcesteri, commonly known as the Worcester's tamarind, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, round fruits with a tangy, acidic flavor. The fruit's pulp is often used in local cuisines, while the leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Its ornamental value and edible qualities make it a valuable plant in both horticulture and culinary contexts."
