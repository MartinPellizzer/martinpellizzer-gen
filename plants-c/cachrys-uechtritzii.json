    "intro": "Cachrys uechtritzii, commonly known as the Echtritz's cypress, is a rare and unique coniferous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, typical of conifers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and taxonomic studies in the region."
