It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds with a smooth, glossy surface, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found growing on exposed rock faces or in crevices, where it can tolerate dry and harsh conditions. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
