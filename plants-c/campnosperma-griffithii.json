    "intro": "Campnosperma griffithii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark that becomes flaky with age. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by woody, elongated pods containing small, dark seeds. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. The species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional Indigenous practices."
