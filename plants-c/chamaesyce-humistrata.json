    "intro": "Chamaesyce humistrata, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, fleshy, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open fields. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a resilient species in its native habitat."
