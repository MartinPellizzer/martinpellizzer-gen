The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the Atlantic coast, often in open woodlands or coastal dunes. Its leaves are fern-like, with a distinct pinnate structure, and it produces small white or greenish flowers. It is a short-lived perennial that plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
