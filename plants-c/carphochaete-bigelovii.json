    "intro": "Carphochaete bigelovii, commonly known as the Bigelow's goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and the plant produces small, ribbed fruits that disperse its seeds."
