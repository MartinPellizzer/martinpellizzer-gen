    "intro": "Callitriche platycarpa var. sclerocaula, commonly known as the hard-stemmed water starwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant produces tiny, white or pink flowers that are clustered near the base of the stems. Its leaves are usually smooth and slightly succulent, adapted to retain moisture in aquatic habitats. This variety is distinguished by its rigid, woody stems, which provide structural support in flowing water."
