    "intro": "Clintonia dulongensis, commonly known as the Longdong bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that mature in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
