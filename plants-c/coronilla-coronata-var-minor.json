    "intro": "Coronilla coronata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep root system, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for erosion control. It is often used in landscaping and restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its small, rounded leaves and compact growth habit make it a low-maintenance ornamental plant."
