    "intro": "Cassinia vauvilliersii var. canescens, commonly known as the silver cassinia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flower heads that are typically clustered in dense, spherical or conical inflorescences. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as woodlands and rocky areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and visual interest."
