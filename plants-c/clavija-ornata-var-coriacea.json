It is characterized by its woody stems and thick, leathery leaves that give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The species is adapted to grow in dry, sunny environments, making it a resilient plant in arid regions."
