    "intro": "Cryptantha muriculata var. vitrea, commonly known as the glassy cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, bead-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, rocky habitats."
