    "intro": "Conospermum paniculatum, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive panicle-shaped inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and salt-tolerant nature make it well adapted to coastal environments. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in sandy soils."
