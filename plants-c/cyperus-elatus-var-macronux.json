    "intro": "Cyperus elatus var. macronux, commonly known as the broad-leaved flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with slender, triangular stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to brown, and it thrives in wet or marshy habitats. Its leaves are broad and flat, often with a waxy texture, and it is often found in disturbed soils near water bodies. This variant is distinguished by its larger, more robust leaves compared to the typical Cyperus elatus."
