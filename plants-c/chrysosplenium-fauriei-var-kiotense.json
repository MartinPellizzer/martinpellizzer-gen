    "intro": "Chrysosplenium fauriei var. kiotense, commonly known as the Kiotense golden saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in early summer. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its rocky, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and delicate floral display."
