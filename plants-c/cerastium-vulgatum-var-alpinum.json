    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum var. alpinum, commonly known as alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to withstand cold climates."
