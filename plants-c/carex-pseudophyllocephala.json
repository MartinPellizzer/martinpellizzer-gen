It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers in the summer. Carex pseudophyllocephala is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
