It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, which float on the water's surface. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that provide a habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its flowers are typically white or pink, opening in the early morning and closing by midday. Culcasia tepoensis plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland habitats."
