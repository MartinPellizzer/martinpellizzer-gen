It is characterized by its vigorous, twining growth habit and produces clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, with bright yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Coutoubea volubilis is often used in gardens as a climbing ornamental due to its attractive foliage and long blooming period."
