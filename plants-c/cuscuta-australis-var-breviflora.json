    "intro": "Cuscuta australis var. breviflora, commonly known as the Australian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment. It produces small, yellowish flowers and is native to Australia, where it often infests native vegetation. The plant has a slender, thread-like stem that wraps around its host, forming a dense network. It is an annual species that thrives in a variety of habitats, including gardens and disturbed areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants."
