    "intro": "Chulusium natans, commonly known as the floating water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in shades of white or pink. Its roots anchor in the mud at the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies. Chulusium natans plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and aiding in water filtration."
