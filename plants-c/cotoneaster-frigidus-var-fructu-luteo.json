    "intro": "Cotoneaster frigidus var. fructu-luteo, commonly known as the yellow-fruited cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by yellow-orange berries that persist into winter. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
