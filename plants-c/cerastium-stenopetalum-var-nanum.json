It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense mats in rocky or alpine environments."
