    "intro": "Chamaeangis urostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bluemink, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a dense rosette near the base. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
