    "intro": "Carex bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, emerging from a bulbous base that stores nutrients. Carex bulbosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
