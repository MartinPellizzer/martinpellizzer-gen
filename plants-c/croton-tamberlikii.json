It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with vibrant green, yellow, and red hues. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
