    "intro": "Cistanche mauritanica, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants, drawing nutrients and water through its specialized haustoria. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers and has a fleshy, branching stem. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it plays a unique role in desert ecosystems."
