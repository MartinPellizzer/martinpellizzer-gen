    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. subtecta, commonly known as the European hazel or dwarf hazel, is a variety of the hazel genus native to Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more rounded leaves compared to the typical hazel. The plant produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which ripen in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in hedgerows or as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. This variety is also valued for its hardiness and ability to grow in a variety of climates."
