It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick stems. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
