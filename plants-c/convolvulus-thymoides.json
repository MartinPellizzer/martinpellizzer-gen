    "intro": "Convolvulus thymoides, commonly known as the woolly morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that produces small, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that are typically opposite and ovate. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed."
