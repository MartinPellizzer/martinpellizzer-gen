    "intro": "Cordula curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's cordula, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a distinct, slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cordula curtisii is considered an endangered species."
