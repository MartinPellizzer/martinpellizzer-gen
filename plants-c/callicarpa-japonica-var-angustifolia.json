It features opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, bright purple berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. These berries mature in the fall and are a key feature of its ornamental value. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often cultivated for its attractive foliage and berries."
