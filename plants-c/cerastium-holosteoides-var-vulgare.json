    "intro": "Cerastium holosteoides var. vulgare, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy, oval leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and garden beds. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to temperate climates."
