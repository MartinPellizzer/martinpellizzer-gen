    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum panigrahianum, commonly known as the Panigrahian cirrhopetalum, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are elongated and glossy, often with a slightly waxy texture, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
