    "intro": "Capparis mithridatica, commonly known as the Persian cucumber or wild cucumber, is a flowering plant native to regions of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its thorny stems and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by green, fleshy fruits resembling cucumbers. The fruit is edible when young but becomes fibrous and less palatable as it matures. It is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions."
