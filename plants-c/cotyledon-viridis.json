    "intro": "Cotyledon viridis, commonly known as the Jade Plant or Silver Leaf, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, often marked by a pale or silver border. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Cotyledon viridis is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
