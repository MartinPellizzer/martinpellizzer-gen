    "intro": "Castilleja mollis, commonly known as the slender paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Castilleja mollis plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
