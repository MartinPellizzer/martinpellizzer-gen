    "intro": "Carex salina var. haematolepis, commonly known as salt marsh sedge, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, three-angled spikelets that are typically green or reddish. This variety thrives in saline or brackish wetlands, often found in marshes and tidal areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in coastal environments. The plant plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and reducing erosion."
