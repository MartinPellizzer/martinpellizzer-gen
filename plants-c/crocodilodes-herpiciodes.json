    "intro": "Crocodilodes herpiciodes, commonly known as the Herpiciodes crocodile plant, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, claw-like leaves that resemble the scales of a crocodile, giving it its distinctive common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in tropical or subtropical forests. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in shades of green and yellow, which help it blend into its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
