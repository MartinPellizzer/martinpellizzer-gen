    "intro": "Coryanthes gustavo-romeroi, commonly known as the Gustavo-Romero's coryanthe, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, with intricate patterns and vibrant colors. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are specialized for pollination by specific insects, particularly beetles, which are attracted by the strong odor and nectar. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
