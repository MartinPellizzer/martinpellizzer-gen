    "intro": "Chrozophora prostrata var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bluestem, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. Small, yellow flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, followed by small, dry fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
