    "intro": "Chamaecrista conferta, commonly known as the hairy ticktree, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in dense, upright clusters. Its seeds are encased in small, curved pods that split open to release the seeds. Chamaecrista conferta is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to full sun conditions."
