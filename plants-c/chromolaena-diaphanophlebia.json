    "intro": "Chromolaena diaphanophlebia, commonly known as the whiteleaf ironwood, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by distinctive, elongated, and often hairy fruits. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental value. Chromolaena diaphanophlebia is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
