    "intro": "Cryptocoryne pontederiifolia subsp. sarawacensis, commonly known as the Sarawak cryptocoryne, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Borneo. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly wavy along the edges. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still water, preferring soft, nutrient-rich substrates. Its flowering is rare, with small, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge from the water surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
