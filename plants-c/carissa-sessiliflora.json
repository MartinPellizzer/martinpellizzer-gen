    "intro": "Carissa sessiliflora, commonly known as the Natal plumbago, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, thorny branches. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are simple, elliptical, and arranged alternately along the stems. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds, contributing to its propagation in suitable environments."
