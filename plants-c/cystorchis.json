    "intro": "Cystorchis, commonly known as the bladder orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, pouch-like structure at the base of their flowers, which is used to trap insects. Cystorchis species are typically found in moist, temperate regions and are often associated with calcareous soils. They have slender, erect stems and produce small, greenish or brownish flowers. The genus includes several species, such as Cystorchis bulbifera and Cystorchis pumila, which are known for their delicate appearance and specialized pollination mechanisms."
