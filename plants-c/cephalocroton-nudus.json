    "intro": "Cephalocroton nudus, commonly known as the naked-headed croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous stems and leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or orange, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in tropical and subtropical areas."
