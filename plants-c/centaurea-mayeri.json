    "intro": "Centaurea mayeri, commonly known as Mayer's cornflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. It produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across suitable environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
