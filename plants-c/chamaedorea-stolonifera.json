It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, arching stems and feather-like, compound leaves. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with its stolons allowing it to spread horizontally and form compact, bushy foliage. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its elegant appearance make it a favored ornamental plant."
