    "intro": "Caroxylon chorassanicum, commonly known as the Chorassan date palm, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and clustered, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible dates, though it is less commonly cultivated than other date palms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Caroxylon chorassanicum is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
