    "intro": "Cerasus \u00d7 shikamae, commonly known as the Japanese cherry plum, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Prunus japonica and Prunus mandshurica. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia. The plant produces small, sweet, and juicy fruits that are typically eaten fresh or used in jams and preserves. Its flowers are pink to white, appearing in early spring before the leaves, adding ornamental value to gardens. The leaves are ovate with a slightly serrated edge, and the plant thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
