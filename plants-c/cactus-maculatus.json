    "intro": "Cactus maculatus, commonly known as the spotted cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed stems that are adorned with clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant features spines that provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through transpiration. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the soil after rare rains. Cactus maculatus is a slow-growing plant that thrives in full sunlight and well-draining soil."
