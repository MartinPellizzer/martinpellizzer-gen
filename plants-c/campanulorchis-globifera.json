    "intro": "Campanulorchis globifera, commonly known as the globular orchid, is a rare and unusual orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded, greenish-yellow pseudobulbs and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks rather than in soil. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
