    "intro": "Caladenia patersonii var. longicauda, commonly known as the long-tailed spider orchid, is a striking terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It features a single, slender stem with a single or occasionally two showy, spider-like flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color. The plant's unique morphology includes a long, slender spur that gives it its common name, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. This orchid is pollinated primarily by thynnid wasps, which are attracted to its nectar-rich flowers."
