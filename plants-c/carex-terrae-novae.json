    "intro": "Carex terrae-novae, commonly known as the Terra Nova sedge, is a perennial plant native to the coastal regions of Newfoundland and Labrador. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along shorelines and in wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, but the plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat."
