    "intro": "Carex binensis, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, greenish flowers, and it produces viable seeds that help in its propagation. Carex binensis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
