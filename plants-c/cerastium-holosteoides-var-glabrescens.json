    "intro": "Cerastium holosteoides var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically features dense clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are small, rounded, and often covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabrescens has reduced hair, giving it a smoother appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas."
