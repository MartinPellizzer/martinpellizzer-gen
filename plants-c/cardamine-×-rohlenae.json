    "intro": "Cardamine \u00d7 rohlenae, commonly known as the rohlen's water crowfoot, is a hybrid plant in the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its parent species."
