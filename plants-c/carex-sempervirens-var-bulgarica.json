    "intro": "Carex sempervirens var. bulgarica, commonly known as the Bulgarian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southeastern Europe. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and dense clusters of spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wet environments."
