    "intro": "Chenopodium album subvar. cymigerum, commonly known as lambsquarters, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs and a prostrate or ascending growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
