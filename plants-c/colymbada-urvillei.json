    "intro": "Colymbada urvillei, commonly known as the Urville's water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its leaves are typically covered in a waxy cuticle that helps repel water, while its roots anchor it in the substrate. Colymbada urvillei plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
