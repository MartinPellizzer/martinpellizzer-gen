    "intro": "Clematis mandshurica, commonly known as the Manchurian Clematis, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, with blue to violet petals and a distinctive yellow center. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vigorous growth and ability to climb trellises or walls."
