    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabrescens is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along paths, and in gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it both a common weed and a hardy ornamental plant."
