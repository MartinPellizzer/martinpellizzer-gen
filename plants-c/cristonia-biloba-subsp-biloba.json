    "intro": "Cristonia biloba subsp. biloba, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds dispersed by the wind. This species is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
