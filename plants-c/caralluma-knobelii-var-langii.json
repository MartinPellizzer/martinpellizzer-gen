    "intro": "Caralluma knobelii var. langii, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming at night. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss and deter herbivores. This species is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant in its native habitat."
