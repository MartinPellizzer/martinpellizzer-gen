    "intro": "Cereus flagelliformis var. speciosus, commonly known as the \"Desert Candelabra,\" is a striking cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that branch into a crown of spiny, segmented ribs. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to extreme desert conditions. The varietal name \"speciosus\" refers to its ornamental appearance, making it a popular choice for collectors and desert gardens."
