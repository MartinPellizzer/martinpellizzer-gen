    "intro": "Centaurea hyalolepis, commonly known as the glassy knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Centaurea hyalolepis is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
