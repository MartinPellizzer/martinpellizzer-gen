    "intro": "Coleus betonicifolius, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in woodland areas. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a noxious weed in parts of North America."
