    "intro": "Cecropia herthae, commonly known as the Herth's ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, cream-colored flowers. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with Azteca ants, which reside in the hollow stems and provide protection against herbivores. Its seeds are dispersed by birds and other animals, contributing to its wide distribution. The tree is also notable for its role in supporting biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
