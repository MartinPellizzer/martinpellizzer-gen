    "intro": "Convolvulus californicus, commonly known as the California morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial that produces trumpet-shaped, five-petaled flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. The plant has a climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports such as fences or trellises. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils. The flowers typically bloom in the morning, hence its common name, and are pollinated by insects."
