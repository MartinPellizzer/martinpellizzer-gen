    "intro": "Cymbidium leachianum, commonly known as the Leach's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and the presence of long, narrow leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a yellow or green throat. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a branching pattern with pseudobulbs. Cymbidium leachianum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
