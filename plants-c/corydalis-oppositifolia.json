    "intro": "Corydalis oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of delicate, pink or purple flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Corydalis oppositifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
