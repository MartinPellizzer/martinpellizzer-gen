It is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and a distinctive, umbrella-shaped canopy. The tree produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by woody pods containing seeds. Its bark is thick and deeply fissured, providing a rugged appearance. The Indian ceiba is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its timber and cultural significance."
