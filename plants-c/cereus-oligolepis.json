It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is known for its striking, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert or xerophytic conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter. Cereus oligolepis is a popular choice for gardens due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
