    "intro": "Cytisus capitatus var. terminalis, commonly known as the sticky broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Cytisus genus. The plant produces small, pea-like pods that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. This variant is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
