    "intro": "Cytisanthus horridus var. lugdunensis, commonly known as the Lugdunensis Cytisanthus, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, humid climate to flourish. Its unique morphology makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts. Due to its limited natural habitat, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
