It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pungent odor. The plant features dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid, salty environments. Its growth habit is typically low and sprawling, often forming mats on sandy or rocky soils. This variety is distinguished by its more pronounced pubescence compared to other varieties of Cryptantha maritima."
