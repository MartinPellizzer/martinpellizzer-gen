    "intro": "Corchorus hirtus var. orinocensis, commonly known as the Orinoco cotton or Orinoco thornweed, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Venezuela and Colombia. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found growing along riverbanks and in wetlands. While not widely cultivated for commercial purposes, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique adaptations to its native habitat."
