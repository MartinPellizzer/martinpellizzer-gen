It is characterized by its showy, yellow pouch-like flower that resembles a slipper, typically measuring 3 to 5 inches in length. The plant has a single, erect stem that bears a single flower, with showy, waxy petals and a distinctive lip. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in rich, humusy soils. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
