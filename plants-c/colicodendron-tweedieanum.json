It is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense, compact rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by elliptical, leathery fruits. Its botanical description is limited due to its extreme rarity and limited study. The species is of particular interest to botanists due to its unusual morphology and potential ecological significance."
