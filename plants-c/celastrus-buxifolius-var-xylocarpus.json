    "intro": "Celastrus buxifolius var. xylocarpus, commonly known as the Indian star gooseberry, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often mistaken for those of boxwood. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a unique and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
