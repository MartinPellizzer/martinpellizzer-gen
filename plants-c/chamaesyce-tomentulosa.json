    "intro": "Chamaesyce tomentulosa, commonly known as the woolly sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, pale green to yellowish leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, providing insulation and reducing water loss. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, appearing in clusters during the spring and summer months. Chamaesyce tomentulosa is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
