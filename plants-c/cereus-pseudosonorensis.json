    "intro": "Cereus pseudosonorensis, commonly known as the Sonoran candleplant, is a cactus native to the Sonoran Desert of North America. It is a tall, columnar plant with a distinctive, candle-like appearance, featuring a smooth, green stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers at night, which are typically pollinated by bats and moths. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The species is adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
