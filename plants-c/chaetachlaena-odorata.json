    "intro": "Chaetachlaena odorata, commonly known as the fragrant fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver or white on the underside. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in a continuous row along the edges of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
