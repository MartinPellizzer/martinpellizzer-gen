It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant is most notable for its bark, which contains the alkaloid quinine, historically used to treat malaria. Its leaves are elliptical with serrated edges, and it produces small, red berries that contain seeds. Cinchona quina thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for both its medicinal properties and ornamental value."
