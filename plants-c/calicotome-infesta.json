    "intro": "Calicotome infesta, commonly known as the Portuguese thorn or barbed wire bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh, dry climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for erosion control and as a source of timber."
