    "intro": "Canthium horridum, commonly known as the horrid hogweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves and produces small, clustered white or yellow flowers. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain numerous tiny seeds. Canthium horridum is notable for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and photodermatitis upon contact."
