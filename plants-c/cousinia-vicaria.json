    "intro": "Cousinia vicaria, commonly known as the mountain cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Cousinia vicaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
