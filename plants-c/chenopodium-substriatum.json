The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Chenopodium substriatum is known for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and spread."
