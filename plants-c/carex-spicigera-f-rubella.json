    "intro": "Carex spicigera f. rubella, commonly known as the red-stemmed sedges, is a variant of the common sedge, characterized by its distinctive reddish hues in its stems and leaves. This plant is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often found in moist to wet soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes over 5,000 species of grass-like plants. The inflorescence consists of a dense, spikelike cluster of small, three-ranked flowers, typical of the genus Carex. Its compact growth habit and seasonal coloration make it a notable plant in ecological and ornamental contexts."
