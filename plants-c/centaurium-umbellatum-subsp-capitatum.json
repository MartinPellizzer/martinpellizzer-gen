    "intro": "Centaurium umbellatum subsp. capitatum, commonly known as the clustered chickweed or mountain chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in a dense, umbrella-like cluster called an umbel. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators like bees and flies, contributing to its ecological role in these habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth form and clustered inflorescence compared to other Centaurium species."
