    "intro": "Cornus lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along its stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and often exhibits a reddish-brown color, which becomes more pronounced with age. Cornus lancifolia is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
