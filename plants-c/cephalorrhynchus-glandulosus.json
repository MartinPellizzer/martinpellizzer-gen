    "intro": "Cephalorrhynchus glandulosus, commonly known as the glandular-headed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy inflorescence and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
