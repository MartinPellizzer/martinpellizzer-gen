    "intro": "Calamus ursinus, commonly known as the bear grass or the bear's root, is a member of the Arecaceae family, which includes palms. It is a tall, rhizomatous plant that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its slender, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by small, round fruits. Calamus ursinus is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported medicinal properties."
