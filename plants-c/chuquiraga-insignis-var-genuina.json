    "intro": "Chuquiraga insignis var. genuina, commonly known as the Andean burro's tail, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are succulent, fleshy, and often covered in fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
