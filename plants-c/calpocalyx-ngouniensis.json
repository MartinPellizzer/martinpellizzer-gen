    "intro": "Calpocalyx ngouniensis, commonly known as the Ngouni calpocalyx, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant typically features palmate leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calpocalyx ngouniensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
