    "intro": "Cardamine cordifolia var. diversifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often heart-shaped and have a distinctive, peppery aroma. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its small, white flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom in early spring. The species is notable for its variability in leaf shape and size, which contributes to its common name \"diversifolia,\" meaning \"varied leaves.\""
