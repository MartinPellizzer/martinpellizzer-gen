    "intro": "Clematis alpina var. angustisepala, commonly known as the narrow-sepaled alpine clematis, is a perennial vine native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, often climbing or trailing over rocky or wooded areas. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with five sepals, which are narrow and pointed, giving it its specific epithet. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three ovate to elliptic leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It is typically found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cool, moist climates with full sun to partial shade."
