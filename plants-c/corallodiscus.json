    "intro": "Corallodiscus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, often spiny or waxy leaves and showy, disc-like flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. They are primarily found in coastal and sandy environments, where they thrive in well-drained soils. Corallodiscus species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to tolerate saline conditions. The genus includes several species, such as Corallodiscus tetragonius, which is native to southern Africa."
