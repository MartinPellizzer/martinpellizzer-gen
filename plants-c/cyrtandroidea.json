    "intro": "Cyrtandroidea, commonly known as the false arum, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Cyrtandroidea species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. They exhibit a variety of leaf shapes and sizes, and some species have showy, colorful bracts that attract pollinators. The genus is notable for its ecological importance in supporting diverse insect and bird populations."
