    "intro": "Calamagrostis arundinacea subsp. heterogluma, commonly known as the silver reed, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration and landscape design."
