    "intro": "Callitriche autumnalis subsp. truncata, commonly known as the cut-leaved water starwort, is a small aquatic or semiaquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows, where it thrives in moist to submerged conditions. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often truncate at the tip, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by insects. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
