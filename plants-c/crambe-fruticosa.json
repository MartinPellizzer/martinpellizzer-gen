    "intro": "Crambe fruticosa, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. Crambe fruticosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
