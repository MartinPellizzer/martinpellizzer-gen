It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical and lobed leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its foliage is often dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
