    "intro": "Cyathea caracasana var. chimborazensis, commonly known as the Chimborazo tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its expansive fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
