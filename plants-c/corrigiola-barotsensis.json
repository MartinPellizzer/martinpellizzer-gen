    "intro": "Corrigiola barotsensis, commonly known as the Barotseland sandwort, is a flowering plant native to Central Africa, particularly found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
