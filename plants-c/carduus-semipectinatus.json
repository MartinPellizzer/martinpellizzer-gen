    "intro": "Carduus semipectinatus, commonly known as the pale thistle, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, where it typically grows in dry, rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its scientific name reflects its semi-pectinate (partly comb-like) leaf structure. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
