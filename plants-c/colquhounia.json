    "intro": "Colquhounia, commonly known as the New Zealand honeysuckle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Colquhounia robusta, which is native to New Zealand. These plants are characterized by their climbing or scrambling growth habit, often featuring tendrils that allow them to climb other vegetation. The flowers are typically small and fragrant, with four to five petals, and they bloom in spring or early summer. Colquhounia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens, though they can be invasive in certain regions."
