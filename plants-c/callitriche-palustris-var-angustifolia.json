It typically grows in shallow water, often in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and often occur in clusters near the water's surface. This variety is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats."
