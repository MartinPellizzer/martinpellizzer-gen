    "intro": "Callistemon lanceolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bottlebrush, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or pink cylindrical flower spikes that resemble bottle brushes, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Callistemon lanceolatus is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract birds and pollinators."
