    "intro": "Cleisocentron neglectum, commonly known as the silverleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom, giving it its common name. Its flowering spikes are usually terminal, bearing small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Cleisocentron neglectum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
