    "intro": "Cynoglossum limense, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss. Its stems are upright and branched, supporting the showy flowers that resemble small bells. Cynoglossum limense thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a valuable addition to gardens and natural habitats."
