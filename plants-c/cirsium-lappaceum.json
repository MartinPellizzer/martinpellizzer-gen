    "intro": "Cirsium lappaceum, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cirsium lappaceum is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
