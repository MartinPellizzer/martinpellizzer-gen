    "intro": "Cousinia polycephala, commonly known as the clustered globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit and produces clusters of yellow flowers in spring. The plant has hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Cousinia polycephala is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in xeriscaping."
