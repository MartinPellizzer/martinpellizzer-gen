    "intro": "Cleistopetalum borneense, commonly known as the Bornean cleistopetalum, is a flowering plant native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers that are often enclosed within a cup-like structure called a hypanthium. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a rough, hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species in tropical botany."
