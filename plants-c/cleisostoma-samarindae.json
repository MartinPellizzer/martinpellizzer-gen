    "intro": "Cleisostoma samarindae, commonly known as the Samarinda ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its striking, translucent white petals and sepals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, growing on tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high atmospheric moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
