    "intro": "Clypeola echinata var. ramosissima, commonly known as the spiny clypeola, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, branched growth habit, which gives it the \"ramosissima\" designation meaning \"very branched.\" The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
