It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and thrives in partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in suitable habitats. The species is often found in nutrient-rich, wet soils and is an important component of riparian ecosystems."
