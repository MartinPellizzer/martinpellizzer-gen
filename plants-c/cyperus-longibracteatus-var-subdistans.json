    "intro": "Cyperus longibracteatus var. subdistans, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. The plant features slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. This variant is distinguished by its elongated bracts and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological adaptability."
