    "intro": "Cuscuta tinctoria var. aurea, commonly known as golden dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to various parts of Europe, Asia, and North America, often found growing on agricultural crops and weeds. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread widely. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is considered a weed in many regions."
