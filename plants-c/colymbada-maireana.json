    "intro": "Colymbada maireana, commonly known as the Maireana fanflower, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces bright yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Colymbada maireana is well adapted to poor soils and can survive in harsh climatic conditions."
