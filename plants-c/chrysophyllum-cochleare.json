    "intro": "Chrysophyllum cochleare, commonly known as the African cherry or yellow bell, is a tropical evergreen tree native to West Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that are encased in a thick, waxy coating, which turns from green to yellow as it ripens. The fruit is edible, with a sweet and tangy flavor, and is often consumed fresh or used in traditional medicine. Additionally, the tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its timber."
