    "intro": "Cochlidium minus, commonly known as the lesser cochlid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has delicate, slender stems that branch out near the base, supporting its small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of tiny, greenish-white blooms that appear in early spring. Cochlidium minus is often overlooked due to its modest appearance, but it plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
