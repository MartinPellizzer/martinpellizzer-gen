The plant has deeply lobed, silvery-green leaves with a rough texture and a distinctive bitter taste. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
