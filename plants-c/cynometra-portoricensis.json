    "intro": "Cynometra portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, dark bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. It is adapted to coastal and dry forest environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
