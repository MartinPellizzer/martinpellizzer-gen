It is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, scale-like structures along the veins. Ctenitis microtricha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
