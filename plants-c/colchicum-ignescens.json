    "intro": "Colchicum ignescens, commonly known as the fire clementine, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its vivid red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the tips of its stems. The plant produces large, showy blooms that are surrounded by specialized leaf-like structures called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
