It is characterized by its aromatic, lemon-scented leaves that contain high levels of citral, a compound responsible for its distinctive fragrance. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its botanical significance lies in its chemical composition and traditional uses in various cultures."
