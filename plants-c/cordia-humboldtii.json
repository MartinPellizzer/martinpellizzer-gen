    "intro": "Cordia humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt's cordia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy green. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters during the dry season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, sticky seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Cordia humboldtii is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils."
