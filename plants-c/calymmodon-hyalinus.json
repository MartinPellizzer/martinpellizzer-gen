    "intro": "Calymmodon hyalinus, commonly known as the glassy green alga, is a type of freshwater algae belonging to the family Ulvaceae. It is characterized by its thin, delicate thallus that often appears translucent or glassy, giving it its common name. This species typically grows on submerged or emergent surfaces in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its structure consists of a single layer of cells that are closely packed, allowing for efficient light absorption. Calymmodon hyalinus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to primary production and serving as a food source for various aquatic organisms."
