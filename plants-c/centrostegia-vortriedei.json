It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
