    "intro": "Cyathea mucilagina, commonly known as the sticky tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant's trunk is covered in a slimy, mucilaginous substance, which gives it its common name and helps retain moisture. Cyathea mucilagina typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often near rivers or in dense forests. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
