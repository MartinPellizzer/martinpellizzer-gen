    "intro": "Castilleja tapeinoclada, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grass of heaven, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reduced leaves and specialized root system that attaches to the roots of host plants. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in open, sunny habitats and is often found in grasslands and shrublands. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants."
