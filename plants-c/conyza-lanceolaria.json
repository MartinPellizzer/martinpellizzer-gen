    "intro": "Conyza lanceolaria, commonly known as common ironweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has slender, branching stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Conyza lanceolaria is known for its ability to produce a large number of seeds, which contribute to its invasive potential in some regions."
