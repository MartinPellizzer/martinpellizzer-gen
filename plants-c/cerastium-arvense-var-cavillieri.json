    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. cavillieri, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and rocky slopes. Its extensive root system allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a resilient ground cover and a potential weed in cultivated areas."
