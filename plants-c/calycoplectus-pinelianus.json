    "intro": "Calycoplectus pinelianus, commonly known as the Pinel Island calycoplectus, is a rare and specialized plant native to a limited geographic region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring cup-like calyces that enclose the reproductive organs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in association with specific soil types. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Due to its restricted habitat and limited genetic diversity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
