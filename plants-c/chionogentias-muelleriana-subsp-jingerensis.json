    "intro": "Chionogentias muelleriana subsp. jingerensis, commonly known as the Jingerensis snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, evergreen leaves that remain throughout the year. Due to its restricted habitat and low population numbers, it is considered a vulnerable species."
