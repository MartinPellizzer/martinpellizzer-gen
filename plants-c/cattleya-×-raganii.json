    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 raganii, commonly known as the Raganii Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is prized for its large, showy flowers that come in a wide range of colors, including pink, yellow, and white. The plant typically produces 2 to 5 blooms per stem, each with a velvety texture and a distinctive lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cattleya \u00d7 raganii is a popular choice for both indoor cultivation and greenhouse environments due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
