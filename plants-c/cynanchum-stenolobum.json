It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by follicles containing seeds with silky hairs. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. Cynanchum stenolobum is part of the Asclepiadaceae family, known for its milkweed relatives and their ecological importance to pollinators."
