    "intro": "Carex polygama subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial plant native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils at high elevations. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas where other plants cannot survive."
