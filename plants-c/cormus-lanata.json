    "intro": "Cormus lanata, commonly known as the hairy corm, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its swollen underground stem, or corm, which serves as a storage organ. It features erect, branched stems covered in soft, hairy foliage, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Cormus lanata is native to certain regions of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its corm is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
