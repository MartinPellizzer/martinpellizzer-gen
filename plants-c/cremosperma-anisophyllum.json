The plant produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain small, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suited for arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an attractive and resilient choice for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
