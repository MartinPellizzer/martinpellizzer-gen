    "intro": "Campylandra emeiensis, commonly known as the Emei Mountain campylandra, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with a fine, hairy texture, while its stems are slender and often trailing. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Campylandra emeiensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
