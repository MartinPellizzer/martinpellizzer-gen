    "intro": "Calamagrostis deschampsioides var. churchilliana, commonly known as Churchill grass, is a tall, ornamental grass native to North America. It features narrow, silver-blue foliage that turns coppery in the fall, creating striking visual interest throughout the growing season. The plant produces feathery, golden-brown plumes in late summer, adding a dramatic flair to gardens. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a low-maintenance choice for landscaping. Its upright growth habit and ability to form dense clumps make it suitable for erosion control and as a backdrop in mixed plantings."
