    "intro": "Ceroxylon ventricosum, commonly known as the Andean wax palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or mountainous regions. Its growth is slow, and it can live for over a century, making it a long-lived species. The Andean wax palm plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
