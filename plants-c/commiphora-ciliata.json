    "intro": "Commiphora ciliata, commonly known as the Indian myrrh or African myrrh, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its aromatic, resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and incense. The plant typically has simple, elliptical leaves with hairy margins, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds. Commiphora ciliata is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its medicinal and aromatic properties."
