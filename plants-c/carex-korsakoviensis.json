    "intro": "Carex korsakoviensis, commonly known as the Korsakov sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike of small, usually wind-pollinated flowers, and it produces distinctive, three-angled seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
