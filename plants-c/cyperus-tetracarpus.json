    "intro": "Cyperus tetracarpus, commonly known as the spike rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, often forming dense mats in waterlogged soils. The botanical features of Cyperus tetracarpus make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
