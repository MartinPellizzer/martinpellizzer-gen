    "intro": "Coreopsoides, commonly known as the swamp coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in marshy or muddy soils and thrives in moist, sunny conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Coreopsoides plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
