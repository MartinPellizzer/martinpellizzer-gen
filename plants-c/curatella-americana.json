    "intro": "Curatella americana, commonly known as the American curatella, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, often dispersed by wind or animals. Curatella americana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens."
