    "intro": "Cladium ancistrophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like blades that are typically less than 1 meter in height. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water or moist soil. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Cladium ancistrophyllum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
