    "intro": "Cyphostemma sanctuarium-selousii, commonly known as the Selous ghost tree, is a woody shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive branching pattern and thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by small, round fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
