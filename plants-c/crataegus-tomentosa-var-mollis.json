    "intro": "Crataegus tomentosa var. mollis, commonly known as the downy hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a hairy underside, giving the plant its \"mollis\" variety name, which means soft or downy. The fruit is a small, red-pink berry that ripens in the fall, providing food for birds and small mammals. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open woods."
