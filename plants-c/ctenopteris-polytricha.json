    "intro": "Ctenopteris polytricha, commonly known as the broad-leafed sea palm, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its large, fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into broad, segmented leaves. The plant thrives in shallow marine environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in tidal zones. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it withstand saltwater exposure. Ctenopteris polytricha plays a role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms."
