    "intro": "Ctenopteris subcrassa, commonly known as the broad-leaf sea holly, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically near coastal areas or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are robust and help it anchor firmly in moist, well-drained soil. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and are also valued for their ornamental appearance in horticulture."
