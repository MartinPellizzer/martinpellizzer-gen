    "intro": "Chamaepitys trifida var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smoothleaf mountain maple, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its alternate, trifoliate leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of riparian and montane ecosystems."
