It typically grows to a height of 60 to 120 centimeters and features gray-green, spiny leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by a series of bracts that give it its characteristic thistle appearance. Its flowering period makes it a notable species in meadows and grasslands. The plant is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
