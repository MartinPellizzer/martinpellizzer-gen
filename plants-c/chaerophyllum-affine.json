    "intro": "Chaerophyllum affine, commonly known as the lesser buttonweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
