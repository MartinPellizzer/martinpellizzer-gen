It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and swampy areas, thriving in moist, acidic soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spiky fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
