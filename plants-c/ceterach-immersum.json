    "intro": "Ceterach immersum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that thrives in saline and sandy environments, often found along the shores of the Indian Ocean. The plant features a rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Ceterach immersum is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray, making it a resilient coastal plant."
