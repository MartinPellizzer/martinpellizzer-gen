    "intro": "Cyrtochilum album, commonly known as the white lady orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant produces delicate, white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are usually ovate and slightly fleshy, adapted to store moisture in its natural habitat. The orchid's root system is specialized for absorbing nutrients from the air and rainwater, typical of many orchid species."
