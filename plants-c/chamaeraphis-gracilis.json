    "intro": "Chamaeraphis gracilis, commonly known as sea beans, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Plantaginaceae. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often appear in clusters, and its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and alternate, adapted to reduce water loss in salty conditions. Chamaeraphis gracilis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
