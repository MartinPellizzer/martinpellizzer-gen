    "intro": "Centaurea peregrinax, commonly known as the wandering thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, bristly stems and bright yellow to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or along coastal areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Centaurea peregrinax is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
