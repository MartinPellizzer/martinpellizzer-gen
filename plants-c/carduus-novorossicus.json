    "intro": "Carduus novorossicus, commonly known as the Russian thistle or goatweed, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia but has been introduced to many other regions, including North America. The plant is characterized by its spiny leaves and a single, tall, branching stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. Its flowers are typically yellow and appear in late summer to early autumn. Carduus novorossicus is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
