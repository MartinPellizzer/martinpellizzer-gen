    "intro": "Carpophora, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often bioluminescent petals that emit a faint glow in the dark. The plant's flowers are typically small and clustered, with a structure that resembles a cluster of tiny, delicate lanterns. Carpophora thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
