It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, often clustered in inflorescences at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Chirita subrhomboidea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and flowering."
