    "intro": "Cleistocactus rojoi, commonly known as the \"Rojoi Cactus,\" is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its stems are cylindrical and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and water loss. Cleistocactus rojoi is well adapted to desert environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
