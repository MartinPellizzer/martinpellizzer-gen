    "intro": "Calamagrostis abnormis, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive purple tinge in its inflorescence, which gives it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in heathlands and wet meadows. Its culms are slender and arching, with long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Calamagrostis abnormis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
