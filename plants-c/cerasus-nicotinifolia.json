    "intro": "Cerasus nicotinifolia, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its showy, single or double pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are edible but not as commonly consumed as other apricot varieties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its botanical features include alternate, ovate leaves and a distinctive branching pattern that adds to its aesthetic appeal."
