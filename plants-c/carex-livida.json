It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces viable seeds that aid in its propagation.
