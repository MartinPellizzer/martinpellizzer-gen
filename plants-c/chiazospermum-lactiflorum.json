    "intro": "Chiazospermum lactiflorum, commonly known as the milkflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its striking, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. Its milk-like sap, which gives it its scientific name, is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It is often used in traditional medicine by Indigenous communities."
