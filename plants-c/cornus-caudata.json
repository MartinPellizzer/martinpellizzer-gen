    "intro": "Cornus caudata, commonly known as redosier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thornless growth habit and its showy, bright red branches that persist through winter. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red berries that attract birds. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Cornus caudata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
