    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus var. salicifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and yellowish-green foliage. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, resembling willow leaves, which is reflected in its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats like grasslands and rocky slopes."
