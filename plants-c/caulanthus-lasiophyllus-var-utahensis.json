    "intro": "Caulanthus lasiophyllus var. utahensis, commonly known as Utah's hairyleaf silversword, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage with hairy surfaces, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in terminal clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat."
