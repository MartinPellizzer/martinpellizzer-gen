It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of purple or pink flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. This variety is often confused with other Centaurea species due to its similar appearance."
