    "intro": "Cheilanthes viridis var. glauca, commonly known as the glaucous rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dark green, glaucous (bluish-gray) foliage. The plant produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in crevices or on limestone. This variety is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in harsh environments."
