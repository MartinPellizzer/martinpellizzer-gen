    "intro": "Carex bukaensis, commonly known as Buka sedge, is a perennial plant native to the Pacific Islands, particularly the Buka Islands in Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or coastal habitats, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowering spikes are usually small and clustered, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex bukaensis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
