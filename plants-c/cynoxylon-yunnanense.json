    "intro": "Cynoxylon yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood and dense foliage. The plant belongs to the family Burseraceae and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy surface, while its flowers are small and fragrant, typically appearing in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
