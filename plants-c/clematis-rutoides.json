    "intro": "Clematis rutoides, commonly known as the blue clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 15 feet, allowing it to climb trees and structures. The plant produces showy, blue-violet flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne in clusters at the base of the stems. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, and it thrives in partial to full sun. Clematis rutoides prefers moist, well-drained soil and is relatively hardy, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
