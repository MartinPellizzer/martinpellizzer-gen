    "intro": "Ceratostylis capitata, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a short, fleshy rhizome and produces a single, upright stem bearing a cluster of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant's most distinctive feature is its spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which have a unique hood-like structure over the reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts but remains relatively rare in the wild."
