    "intro": "Convolvulus luteolus, commonly known as the yellow morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a herbaceous annual with trailing stems that produce small, yellow flowers. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it both a weed and a cultivated plant in some regions."
