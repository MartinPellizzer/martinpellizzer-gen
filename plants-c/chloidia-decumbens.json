    "intro": "Chloidia decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate chloidia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features creeping stems that lie close to the ground, often rooting at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to store water in harsh environments. Chloidia decumbens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
