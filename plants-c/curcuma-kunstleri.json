    "intro": "Curcuma kunstleri, commonly known as the ornamental turmeric, is a rhizomatous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its ornamental leaves that are often variegated with yellow and green hues. The plant produces compact inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its rhizomes, while not as widely used for medicinal purposes as other curcuma species, are sometimes cultivated for their aesthetic value in gardens. Curcuma kunstleri thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
