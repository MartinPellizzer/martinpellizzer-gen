    "intro": "Cinnamomum talawaense, commonly known as the Talawa cinnamon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like laurel and avocado. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers followed by berries. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine and for their aromatic properties. However, it is less commercially cultivated compared to other cinnamon species due to its limited yield and specific growing conditions."
