It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which appear in late spring. Its fruit is a legume pod containing several seeds. Caragana aitchisonii is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
