    "intro": "Cercocarpus montanus var. macrourus, commonly known as the bigleaf curlleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and grayish bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are typically large, ovate, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by distinctive, inflated fruits that split open to release seeds. This plant is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
