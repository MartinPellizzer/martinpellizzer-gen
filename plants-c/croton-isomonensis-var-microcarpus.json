    "intro": "Croton isomonensis var. microcarpus, commonly known as the dwarf croton, is a compact shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features striking, variegated leaves with a mix of green, yellow, and red hues, which add visual interest to gardens. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
