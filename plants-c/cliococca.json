    "intro": "Cliococca, commonly known as the marsh holly or water holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and bogs, where they thrive in moist, acidic soils. Cliococca species are characterized by their shrub-like growth habit, with small, evergreen leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that are often pink or white. The genus includes several species, such as Cliococca corymbosa, which is native to parts of Europe and Asia. These plants play an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
