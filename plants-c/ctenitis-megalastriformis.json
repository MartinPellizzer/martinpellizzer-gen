    "intro": "Ctenitis megalastriformis, commonly known as the giant star fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, frond-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer that helps it retain moisture. Its reproductive structures are located at the base of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife."
