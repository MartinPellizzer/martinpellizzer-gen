    "intro": "Cypripedium praestans var. warocqueanum, commonly known as the Warocqueanum\u6753\u5170, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a deep pink or purple hue with intricate patterns. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its high-altitude, often harsh environment. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, adapted to maximize light absorption in shaded forest conditions. This variant is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
