    "intro": "Calandrinia mucronulata, commonly known as the narrow-pointed purslane, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Calandrinia mucronulata is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its ability to store water in its leaves and stems."
