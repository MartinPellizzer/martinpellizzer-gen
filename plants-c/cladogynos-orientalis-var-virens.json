    "intro": "Cladogynos orientalis var. virens, commonly known as the green-flowered oriental cladogynos, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The variety 'virens' is distinguished by its consistently green floral coloration, setting it apart from other variants of the species."
