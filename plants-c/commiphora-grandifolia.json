    "intro": "Commiphora grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered myrrh, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary cymes, followed by the release of a fragrant resin. Its resin, known as myrrh, has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and incense. Commiphora grandifolia thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils."
