    "intro": "Cyclonema, commonly known as the spiral leaf plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with simple, alternate leaves that often have a waxy texture. Cyclonema species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia. They produce small, clustered flowers that can be white, pink, or purple, depending on the species."
