    "intro": "Cynodon dactylon var. longiglumis, commonly known as hairy bermuda grass, is a variant of the widely distributed grass species Cynodon dactylon. It is characterized by its long, slender glumes and hairy leaves, which distinguish it from other varieties of bermuda grass. This plant is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread aggressively and form dense mats. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban landscapes."
