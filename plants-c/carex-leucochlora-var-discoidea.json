    "intro": "Carex leucochlora var. discoidea, commonly known as the white-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its white or pale green inflorescence makes it distinct from other sedges in its habitat."
