    "intro": "Conocephalus singalensis, commonly known as the Singalensis fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky surfaces or soil. The plant plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
