It is a small shrub or tree with simple, alternate leaves that are often leathery and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, boat-shaped fruits. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in coastal vegetation."
