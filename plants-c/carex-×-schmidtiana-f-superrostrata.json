    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 schmidtiana f. superrostrata, commonly known as the broad-beak sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its robust, grass-like foliage and distinctive, broad, boat-shaped leaf tips. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshy or boggy habitats. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually greenish or reddish in color. This ornamental sedge is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in wetland environments."
