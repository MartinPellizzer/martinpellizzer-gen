    "intro": "Cyclanthera montana, commonly known as the mountain cucumber, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbit plants like pumpkins and gourds. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that are often followed by elongated, cucurbit-like fruits. Its fruits are typically edible, though they are not commonly cultivated for food. Cyclanthera montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
