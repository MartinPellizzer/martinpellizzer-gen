    "intro": "Corchorus pseudocapsularis, commonly known as the false capuchinweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China and India. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, and its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. It is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
