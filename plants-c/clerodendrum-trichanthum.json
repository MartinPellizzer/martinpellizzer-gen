    "intro": "Clerodendrum trichanthum, commonly known as the African flame bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its striking, showy red and orange bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are often overlooked due to the prominence of the bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage. Clerodendrum trichanthum is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
