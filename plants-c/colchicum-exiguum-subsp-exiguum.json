    "intro": "Colchicum exiguum subsp. exiguum, commonly known as the dwarf autumn crocus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Colchicaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its striking purple to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing toxic seeds. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and cool, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is needed due to its poisonous nature."
