    "intro": "Cheilanthes crenata, commonly known as the serrate rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and dark green, serrated fronds. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its fronds. Cheilanthes crenata is often found in crevices and on rock surfaces, making it a hardy and resilient species in harsh environments."
