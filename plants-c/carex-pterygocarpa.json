    "intro": "Carex pterygocarpa, commonly known as the wing-fruited sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, inconspicuous flowers. Its fruiting structures, called achenes, are distinctive for their wing-like appendages, which aid in wind dispersal. This species is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
