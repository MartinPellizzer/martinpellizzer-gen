    "intro": "Casuarina cunninghamiana, commonly known as the river she-oak, is a hardy evergreen tree native to Australia. It has needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches, giving it a unique, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in coastal and riverine environments, often forming dense thickets. Its root system helps stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control in sandy or coastal areas."
