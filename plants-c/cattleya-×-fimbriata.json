    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 fimbriata, commonly known as the fimbriated cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its vibrant, often bicolor flowers. It originates from a cross between Cattleya labiata and Cattleya mossiae, resulting in a plant with striking, elongated petals and a distinctive lip. The species is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is a popular choice among orchid growers due to its ease of cultivation and showy blooms. The plant typically produces multiple flower spikes each year, adding to its ornamental value."
