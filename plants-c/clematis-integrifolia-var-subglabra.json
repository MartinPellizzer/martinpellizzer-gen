    "intro": "Clematis integrifolia var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth Clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are typically smooth and slightly serrated. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, usually in shades of white, pink, or purple. Its stems are slender and twining, allowing it to climb and spread along supports. The foliage turns yellow in autumn, adding seasonal interest to gardens and natural habitats."
