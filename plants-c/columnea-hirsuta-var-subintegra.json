    "intro": "Columnea hirsuta var. subintegra, commonly known as the hairy flame flower, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It features striking, tubular red to orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling flames, and are particularly attractive to hummingbirds. The plant has velvety, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive texture and appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
