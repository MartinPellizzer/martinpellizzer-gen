    "intro": "Copaifera hemitomophylla, commonly known as the Brazilian copaiba, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, smooth, grayish bark and can grow up to 30 meters tall. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in pendulous clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its most notable feature is the resin it secretes, which has been traditionally used for its medicinal properties. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin."
