    "intro": "Carex truncata, commonly known as the cutleaf sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and pond edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often truncate at the base, giving it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. Carex truncata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland habitats."
