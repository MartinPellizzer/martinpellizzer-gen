    "intro": "Carex disticha f. floribunda, commonly known as the flowering sedge, is a variant of the common sedge that exhibits a unique flowering habit. It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often found in moist to wet soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in early summer. Its ornamental value comes from its dense, upright growth and showy inflorescences. It is often used in wetland gardens or as a ground cover in boggy areas."
