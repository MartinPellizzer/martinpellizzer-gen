    "intro": "Caryota rumphiana var. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean fishtail palm, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately divided leaves that resemble the tail of a fish, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as a solitary tree with a slender trunk and can reach heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are broad and have a distinctive, feathery appearance, often used in traditional crafts and as a decorative element. The Bornean fishtail palm thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
