    "intro": "Coriophyllus jonesii, commonly known as the Jones' coriophyll, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, bright red or purple flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
