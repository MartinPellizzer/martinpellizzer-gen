    "intro": "Cinchona elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of alkaloids like quinine, which have been historically used to treat malaria. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its bark and leaves are the primary sources of the bioactive compounds that make it valuable in traditional and modern medicine."
