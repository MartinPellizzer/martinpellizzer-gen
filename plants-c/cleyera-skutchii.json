    "intro": "Cleyera skutchii, commonly known as Skutch's inkberry, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It belongs to the family Actinidiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Cleyera skutchii is typically found in shaded, moist habitats and is considered a relict species with a limited geographic distribution. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and conservation studies."
