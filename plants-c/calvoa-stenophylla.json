    "intro": "Calvoa stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf calvoa, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Calvoa genus. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calvoa stenophylla is considered an endangered species."
