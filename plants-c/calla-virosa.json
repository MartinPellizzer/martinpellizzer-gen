    "intro": "Calla virosa, commonly known as the virus calla, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves and a single, white spathe that encloses a spadix. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy environments and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces berries that contain the seeds. Calla virosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
