    "intro": "Clermontia oblongifolia subsp. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed oblong-leaf clermonia, is a rare endemic plant native to Hawaii. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and dark green, ovate to oblong-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests and is often found on windward slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species requiring conservation efforts."
