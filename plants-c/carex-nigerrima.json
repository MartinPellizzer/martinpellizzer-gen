    "intro": "Carex nigerrima, commonly known as black root sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its dark, fibrous roots are a distinguishing feature, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Carex nigerrima plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
