    "intro": "Cheiranthus cheiranthoides var. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate cheiranthus, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a hardy perennial in mild climates."
