    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale f. pannonicum, commonly known as the Pannonian autumn crocus, is a variant of the autumn crocus native to Central Europe. It is a perennial herbaceous plant with striking violet-purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features large, showy flowers with three petals and three sepals, and it produces red berries that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in woodland and meadow habitats, preferring moist, well-drained soil. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
