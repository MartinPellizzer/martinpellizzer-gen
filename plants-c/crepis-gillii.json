    "intro": "Crepis gillii, commonly known as the Gill's mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in damp meadows and along stream banks. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Crepis gillii is a relatively small plant, usually not exceeding 30 cm in height, and is often overlooked due to its modest appearance."
