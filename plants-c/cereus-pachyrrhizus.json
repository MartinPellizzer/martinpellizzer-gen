It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant's botanical features make it a unique and popular specimen in botanical gardens and cactus collections."
