    "intro": "Cheilanthes californica var. amoena, commonly known as the California rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that form dense, low-growing clumps. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
