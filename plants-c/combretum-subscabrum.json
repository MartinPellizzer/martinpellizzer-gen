    "intro": "Combretum subscabrum, commonly known as the rough combretum, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, woody capsules containing seeds. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in dry savanna and woodland habitats. Combretum subscabrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
