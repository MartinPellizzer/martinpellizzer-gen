It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with wavy margins and are covered in fine, prickly hairs. The species is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for insects."
