It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is known for its large, broad leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their potential health benefits. It is an important crop in the global coffee industry, although it is less commonly cultivated than other coffee species."
