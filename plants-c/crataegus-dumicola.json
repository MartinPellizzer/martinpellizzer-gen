    "intro": "Crataegus dumicola, commonly known as the rock hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Crataegus dumicola typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often found in woodland edges and open areas. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
