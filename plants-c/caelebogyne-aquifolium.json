Its leaves are typically broad and have a leathery texture, with a deep green color that often features a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white in color. It thrives in moist environments, such as marshes or along the edges of water bodies. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by water."
