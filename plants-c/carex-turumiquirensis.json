    "intro": "Carex turumiquirensis, commonly known as the Turumiquire sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America, particularly Colombia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a cylindrical shape, typical of many sedges. Carex turumiquirensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystem."
