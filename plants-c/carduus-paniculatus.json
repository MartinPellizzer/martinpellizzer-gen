    "intro": "Carduus paniculatus, commonly known as the greater thistle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, showy purple to pink flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits with a pappus that aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its prickly nature, it is often considered a weed but also has historical uses in herbal medicine."
