    "intro": "Canthium foliosum, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a flowering plant native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
