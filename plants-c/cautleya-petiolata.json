    "intro": "Cautleya petiolata, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a species of terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant features long, slender petioles and broad, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinct, spurred lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Cautleya petiolata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments."
