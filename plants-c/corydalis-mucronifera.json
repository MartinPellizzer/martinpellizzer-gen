    "intro": "Corydalis mucronifera, commonly known as the narrow-lobed corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces slender, branching stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Corydalis mucronifera is known for its early spring blooming habit, often appearing before the leaves are fully developed. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
