    "intro": "Cyclanthera eremocarpa var. angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bitter gourd, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It produces elongated, green fruits with a distinctive warty surface and a bitter taste. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and is often cultivated for its edible fruits, though they require careful preparation due to their bitterness. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is typically grown in full sun. The species is part of the Cucurbitaceae family, sharing characteristics with other gourd plants."
