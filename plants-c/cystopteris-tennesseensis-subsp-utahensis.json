    "intro": "Cystopteris tennesseensis subsp. utahensis, commonly known as the Utah water fern, is a rare fern species native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically borne on slender, creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky crevices, where it can access the consistent moisture it requires. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits."
