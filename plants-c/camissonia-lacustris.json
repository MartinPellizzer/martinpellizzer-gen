    "intro": "Camissonia lacustris, commonly known as the lake camissonia, is a delicate annual plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant features small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Camissonia lacustris is adapted to wet environments but can tolerate short periods of drought."
