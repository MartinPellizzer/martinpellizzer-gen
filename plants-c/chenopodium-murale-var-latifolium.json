    "intro": "Chenopodium murale var. latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf goosefoot, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features succulent, broad leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides or in waste areas. Its nutritional value has made it a subject of interest for both traditional and modern uses."
