    "intro": "Cryptantha macbridei, commonly known as the MacBride's cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which help it conserve water in its arid habitat. It produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cryptantha macbridei is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny environments."
