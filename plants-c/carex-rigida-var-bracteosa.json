    "intro": "Carex rigida var. bracteosa, commonly known as bracteated sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, triangular leaves. The plant produces cylindrical spikes of small, usually greenish or brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its bract-like structures at the base of the flowering spikes, giving it its common name."
