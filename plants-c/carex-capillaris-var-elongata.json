    "intro": "Carex capillaris var. elongata, commonly known as the long-leaf sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy areas in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically elongated, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in riparian zones and swampy habitats. This sedge is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
