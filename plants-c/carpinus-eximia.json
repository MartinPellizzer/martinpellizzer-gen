    "intro": "Carpinus eximia, commonly known as the American hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, round nuts enclosed in a spiky husk. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Carpinus eximia is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in landscaping."
