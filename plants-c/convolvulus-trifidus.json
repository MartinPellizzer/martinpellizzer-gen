    "intro": "Convolvulus trifidus, commonly known as the three-lobed morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual with trailing stems that produce small, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The leaves are trifid, meaning they are divided into three lobes, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The plant is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
