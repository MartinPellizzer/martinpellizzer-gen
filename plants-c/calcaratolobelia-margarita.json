    "intro": "Calcaratolobelia margarita, commonly known as the margarita lobe, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble small, rounded bells. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, while its flowers display vibrant colors, often in shades of pink and white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
