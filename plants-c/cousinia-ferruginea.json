    "intro": "Cousinia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in high-altitude environments. The plant features wiry stems and basal leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, usually in shades of pink to purple. Cousinia ferruginea is adapted to harsh climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
