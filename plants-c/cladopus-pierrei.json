    "intro": "Cladopus pierrei, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Cladopus pierrei is often found in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
