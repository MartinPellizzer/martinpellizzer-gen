    "intro": "Cyperorchis \u00d7 gammieana, commonly known as the hybrid orchid grass, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Cyperorchis bulbosus and Cyperorchis formosanus. This plant is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
