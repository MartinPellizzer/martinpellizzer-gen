    "intro": "Chlora perfoliata var. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering chlora, is a perennial herb native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom later in the season, typically from late summer to early fall. Its leaves are often perforated or have a distinctive midrib that allows the stems to pass through, giving it its scientific name. This variety is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
