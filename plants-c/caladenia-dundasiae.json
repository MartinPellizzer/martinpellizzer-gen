    "intro": "Caladenia dundasiae, commonly known as the Dundas Spider-orchid, is a striking terrestrial orchid native to Western Australia. It features a single, slender stem that supports a single, showy flower with a distinctive spider-like appearance. The flower has a pale green to yellowish sepal and petal, with a dark red or purple labellum that resembles a spider's body. It blooms during the cooler months, typically from July to September, and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. This species is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
