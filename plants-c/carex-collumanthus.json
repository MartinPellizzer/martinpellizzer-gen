    "intro": "Carex collumanthus, commonly known as the long-awned sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, and it thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and swampy areas. Carex collumanthus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic and riparian plant communities."
