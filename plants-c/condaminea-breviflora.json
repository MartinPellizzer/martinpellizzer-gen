    "intro": "Condaminea breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered condaminea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to white. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reflect excess sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Condaminea breviflora is considered a vulnerable species."
