It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salty, maritime environments. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ceraia setifolia is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
