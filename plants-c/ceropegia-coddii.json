    "intro": "Ceropegia coddii, commonly known as the African violet or the string of hearts, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, tubular leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, pale greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in clusters. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot. Ceropegia coddii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and ease of care."
