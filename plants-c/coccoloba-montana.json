    "intro": "Coccoloba montana, commonly known as the mountain beauty or rock coral, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly found in Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and dry habitats, often on slopes or cliffs. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a distinctive, almost coral-like appearance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique foliage."
