    "intro": "Claoxylon sandwicense var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-habronema hibiscus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal or lowland habitats. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and the stems are woody with a smooth, glabrous surface. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
