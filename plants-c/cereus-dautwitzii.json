    "intro": "Cereus dautwitzii, commonly known as the Dautwitz's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant produces spines that are typically pale yellow to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
