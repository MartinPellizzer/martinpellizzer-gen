It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its striking, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique inflorescence consists of a loose raceme of flowers that resemble a train of small, showy blossoms.
