    "intro": "Cleome prostrata, commonly known as creeping cleome, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in groups of three, with five petals each. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Cleome prostrata is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
