It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and flowering stems. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along streams. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. The variety paucisetosa is distinguished by its reduced number of hairs on the stems and leaves compared to the typical form."
