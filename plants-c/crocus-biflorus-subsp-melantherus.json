    "intro": "Crocus biflorus subsp. melantherus, commonly known as the black-flowered crocus, is a rare and striking member of the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its deep purple to black petals, which contrast sharply with its yellow stamens. Native to southern Europe, this subspecies thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant produces small, tuberous corms that store nutrients for the next growing season. Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after species among horticulturists and botanists."
