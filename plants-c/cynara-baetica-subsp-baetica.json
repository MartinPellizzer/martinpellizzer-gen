    "intro": "Cynara baetica subsp. baetica, commonly known as the Spanish artichoke, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features robust, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces purple-brown flower heads that develop into edible, spiny buds, similar to the globe artichoke. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental and culinary value. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to other Cynara species."
