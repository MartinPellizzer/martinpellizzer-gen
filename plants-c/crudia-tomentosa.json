    "intro": "Crudia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly Crudia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
