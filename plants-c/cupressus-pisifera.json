    "intro": "Cupressus pisifera, commonly known as the Japanese cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Japan. It belongs to the family Cupressaceae and is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, round cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Due to its slow growth and longevity, it is a popular choice for ornamental planting in temperate climates."
