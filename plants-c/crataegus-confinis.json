    "intro": "Crataegus confinis, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and its clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically elliptical with finely toothed margins and turn yellow in the fall. Crataegus confinis is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland edges and stream banks."
