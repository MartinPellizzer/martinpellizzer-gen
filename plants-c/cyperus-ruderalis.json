    "intro": "Cyperus ruderalis, commonly known as the swamp cyperus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in wetland habitats. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its rhizomes help it spread across wetlands. It has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often green or reddish in color. Cyperus ruderalis is adaptable and can thrive in disturbed environments, making it a common weed in wetland restoration projects."
