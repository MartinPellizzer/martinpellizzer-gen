    "intro": "Cleome brachiata, commonly known as the Mexican spider flower, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and striking, spider-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the branches. Cleome brachiata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant blooms and relatively low maintenance requirements."
