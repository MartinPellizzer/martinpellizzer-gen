    "intro": "Cleistogenes serotina var. jeholensis, commonly known as the Jehol false brome, is a perennial grass species native to northern China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the production of seed heads that remain closed (cleistogamous) for much of the growing season. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique reproductive strategy and ecological adaptations."
