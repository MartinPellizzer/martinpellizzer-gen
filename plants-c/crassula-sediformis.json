It features a compact, bushy growth habit with fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its leaves are thick and store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
