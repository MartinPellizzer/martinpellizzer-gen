    "intro": "Canarium connarifolium, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are often glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range."
