    "intro": "Cladanthus canescens, commonly known as the desert aster, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Its grayish-green foliage and showy yellow flowers bloom during the spring and early summer. Cladanthus canescens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
