    "intro": "Cyathea aurea var. squamosa, commonly known as the silver tree, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The fronds are covered in a distinctive silvery-white tomentum, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant has a slow growth rate and is valued for its ornamental appearance in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
