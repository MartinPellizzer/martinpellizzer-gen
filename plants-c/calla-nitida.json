    "intro": "Calla nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf calla, is a species of flowering plant in the Araceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its striking, waxy, white spathe that surrounds a spadix. The plant produces small, green berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Calla nitida thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
