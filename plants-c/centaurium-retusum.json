    "intro": "Centaurium retusum, commonly known as the rough centaury, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or purple, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. The seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release the seeds."
