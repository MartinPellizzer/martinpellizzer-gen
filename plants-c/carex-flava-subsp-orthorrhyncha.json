    "intro": "Carex flava subsp. orthorrhyncha, commonly known as the yellow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that appear in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its leafy stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, triangular spikelets that are often arranged in two distinct clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting biodiversity in wetland habitats."
