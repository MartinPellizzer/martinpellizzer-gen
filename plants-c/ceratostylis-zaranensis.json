    "intro": "Ceratostylis zaranensis, commonly known as the Zaranese horned orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to retain moisture. The orchid's unique floral structure includes a distinctive, horn-like spur that aids in pollination by specific insect species."
