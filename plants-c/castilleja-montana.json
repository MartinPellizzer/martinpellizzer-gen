    "intro": "Castilleja montana, commonly known as mountain milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and has small, yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately divided, and it often grows in open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Castilleja montana is known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with certain fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
