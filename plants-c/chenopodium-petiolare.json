    "intro": "Chenopodium petiolare, commonly known as lambsquarters, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are small and dry, often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Chenopodium petiolare is commonly found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
