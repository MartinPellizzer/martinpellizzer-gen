    "intro": "Crataegus walokochiana var. subrotundifolia, commonly known as the subrotundifolius hawthorn, is a rare shrub native to specific regions of Eastern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are slightly rounded at the base. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in spring, which are clustered in umbels and attract pollinators such as bees. Its berries, which ripen in late summer, are typically red or orange and serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant but endangered species."
