It is characterized by its distinctive, sharply pointed leaves and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit is a red, fleshy pome that ripens in late summer, attracting various wildlife species. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
