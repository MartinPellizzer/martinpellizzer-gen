    "intro": "Carex spadicea, commonly known as spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common component of wetland ecosystems."
