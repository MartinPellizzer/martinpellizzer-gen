    "intro": "Commiphora merkii, commonly known as the Persian gum or Indian bdellium, is a small, spiny shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and parts of India. It is characterized by its dense, thorny foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a resinous sap, which is tapped and used in traditional medicine and as a perfume ingredient. Its leaves are often used in herbal remedies for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Commiphora merkii thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall."
