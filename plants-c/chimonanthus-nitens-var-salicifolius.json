It is characterized by its lanceolate, bright green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers in late winter or early spring, before the leaves emerge. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental gardens. Its unique blooming period and attractive foliage make it a valuable addition to winter gardens."
