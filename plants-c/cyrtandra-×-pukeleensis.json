    "intro": "Cyrtandra \u00d7 pukeleensis, commonly known as the Pukeleensis hybrid, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Hawaii. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with a glossy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyrtandra \u00d7 pukeleensis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
