It belongs to the Camissoniaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery or grayish coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is notable for its small, white or pale pink flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
