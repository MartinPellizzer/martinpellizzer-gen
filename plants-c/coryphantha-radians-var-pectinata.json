    "intro": "Coryphantha radians var. pectinata, commonly known as the Pectinata Coryphantha, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its attractive appearance and ease of care."
