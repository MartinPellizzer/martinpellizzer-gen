    "intro": "Caesalpinia pulcherrima var. insignis, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has palmately compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its bark is smooth and reddish in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a street tree. The seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
