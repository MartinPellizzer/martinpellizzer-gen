    "intro": "Cryptantha mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Cryptantha mexicana is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along streambanks."
