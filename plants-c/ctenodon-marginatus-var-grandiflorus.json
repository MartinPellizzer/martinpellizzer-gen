    "intro": "Ctenodon marginatus var. grandiflorus, commonly known as the giant leaved ctenodon, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves that can reach several feet in length, often with a waxy texture and a distinctive greenish-blue hue. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-draining soil. Due to its limited natural habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a challenging but rewarding plant for experienced growers."
