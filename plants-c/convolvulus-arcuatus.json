    "intro": "Convolvulus arcuatus, commonly known as the zigzag morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, winding stems that often curl in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Convolvulus arcuatus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun."
