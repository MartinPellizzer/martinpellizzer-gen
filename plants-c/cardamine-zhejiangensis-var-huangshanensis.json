    "intro": "Cardamine zhejiangensis var. huangshanensis, commonly known as Huangshan watercress, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Zhejiang and Anhui provinces in China. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky crevices. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to other members of the cabbage family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
