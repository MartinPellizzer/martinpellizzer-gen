    "intro": "Carex remota, commonly known as the remote sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are grass-like, with a triangular cross-section, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Carex remota is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
