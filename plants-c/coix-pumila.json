    "intro": "Coix pumila, commonly known as the dwarf millet, is a small annual grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny grains. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its seeds are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines, though they are less common in modern agriculture. Coix pumila is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
