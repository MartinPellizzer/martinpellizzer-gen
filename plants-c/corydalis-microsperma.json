    "intro": "Corydalis microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces small, elongated seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Corydalis microsperma thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it a notable species for both horticultural interest and ecological studies."
