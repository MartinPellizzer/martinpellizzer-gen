It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers, which are followed by violet to purple berries. These berries are edible and often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
