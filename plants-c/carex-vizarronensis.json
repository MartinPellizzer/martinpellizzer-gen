    "intro": "Carex vizarronensis, commonly known as the Vizarr\u00f3n sedge, is a flowering plant species native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in high-altitude environments. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Carex vizarronensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
