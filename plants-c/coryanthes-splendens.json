    "intro": "Coryanthes splendens, commonly known as the splendid coryanthe, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces a unique structure called a resupinate flower, which is a specialized arrangement of petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric humidity to flourish. Its vivid colors and intricate floral morphology make it a striking addition to botanical gardens and a subject of scientific interest."
