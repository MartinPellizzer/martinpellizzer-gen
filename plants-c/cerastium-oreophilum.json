    "intro": "Cerastium oreophilum, commonly known as alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Cerastium oreophilum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas at high altitudes."
