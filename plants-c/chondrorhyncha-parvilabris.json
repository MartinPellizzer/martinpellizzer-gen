    "intro": "Chondrorhyncha parvilabris, commonly known as the small-lipped chondrorhynch, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific tropical habitats. It exhibits unique botanical features, including a compact growth form and distinctive, bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The plant's leaves are typically ovate and covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, which may aid in moisture retention. Its flowers, which are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, have a short, narrow labellum that distinguishes it from other orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
