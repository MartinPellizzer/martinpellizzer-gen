    "intro": "Cedrela palustris, commonly known as the swamp cedar, is a tropical tree species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant thrives in moist, swampy environments, often growing in wetlands and along riverbanks. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, though it is also used in traditional medicine. Cedrela palustris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
