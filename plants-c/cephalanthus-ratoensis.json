    "intro": "Cephalanthus ratoensis, commonly known as the Rato's beautyberry, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking clusters of small, violet-blue berries that appear in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white flowers in the early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The berries are not only ornamental but also serve as a food source for various bird species."
