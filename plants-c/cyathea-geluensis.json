It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and large, feathery fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in lowland rainforests. Its rhizome is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in the soil and support its considerable height. Cyathea geluensis plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to forest structure and providing shelter for various organisms."
