    "intro": "Chorizema ulotropis, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions. Chorizema ulotropis plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
