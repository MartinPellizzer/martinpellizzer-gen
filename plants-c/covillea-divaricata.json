    "intro": "Covillea divaricata, commonly known as the Desert Candelabra, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features a distinctive, branched stem with dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Covillea divaricata is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
