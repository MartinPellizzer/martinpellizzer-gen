It is characterized by its striking, flame-like red and orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-shaped, providing a lush backdrop to its vibrant blooms. Coelogyne ustulata thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
