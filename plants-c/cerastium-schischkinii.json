It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy, ovate leaves and produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
