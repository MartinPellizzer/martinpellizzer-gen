    "intro": "Critamus saxifragus, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in arid environments."
