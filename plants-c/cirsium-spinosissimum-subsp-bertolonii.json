    "intro": "Cirsium spinosissimum subsp. bertolonii, commonly known as the Bertoloni's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and large, lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to violet flowers in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
