    "intro": "Ceradenia phloiocharis, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Colombia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers and is typically found growing in shaded, humid environments. The plant has a compact growth habit with a single stem and produces small, intricate blooms during the wet season. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Ceradenia phloiocharis is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival."
