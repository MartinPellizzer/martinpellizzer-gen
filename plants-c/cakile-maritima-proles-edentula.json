    "intro": "Cakile maritima proles edentula, commonly known as the toothless sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, white or yellow flowers and pinnately compound leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. Its proles edentula subspecies is distinguished by the absence of teeth on its leaflets, giving it a smoother appearance. This plant plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
