    "intro": "Cephalocereus blossfeldiorum, commonly known as the Blossfeld's organ pipe cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in white spines. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its adaptations to desert environments include thick, fleshy stems for water storage and a shallow root system to absorb moisture from infrequent rains. This cactus is well-suited for cultivation in dry climates with minimal water requirements."
