    "intro": "Corallorhiza pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's coralroot, is an epiparasitic orchid native to the western United States. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant has a slender, branching stem covered in small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to orange, with a tubular shape and a short spur. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as coniferous forests."
