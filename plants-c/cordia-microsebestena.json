    "intro": "Cordia microsebestena, commonly known as the small-leaved cottonwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits that split open to release seeds. Its bark is often fissured and may exude a milky sap when wounded. Cordia microsebestena is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
