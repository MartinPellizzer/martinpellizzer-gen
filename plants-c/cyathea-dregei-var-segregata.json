    "intro": "Cyathea dregei var. segregata, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its upright growth habit. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
