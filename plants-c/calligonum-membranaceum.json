    "intro": "Calligonum membranaceum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation. Due to its resilience, it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
