    "intro": "Clermontia spatulata, commonly known as the spoonleaf clermonthe, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive spoon-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and mesic shrublands. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Clermontia spatulata is considered a rare and endangered species."
