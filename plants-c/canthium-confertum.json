    "intro": "Canthium confertum, commonly known as the dense thornapple, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its spiny stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is native to regions of Africa, particularly in the eastern and southern parts, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its thorny nature, it is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges."
