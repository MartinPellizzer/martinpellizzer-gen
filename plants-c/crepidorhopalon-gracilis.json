It features small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water, typical of xerophytic plants. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters and blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists studying drought-resistant flora."
