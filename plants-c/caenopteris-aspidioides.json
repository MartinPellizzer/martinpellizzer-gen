    "intro": "Caenopteris aspidioides, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are typically divided into numerous small, serrated segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. Caenopteris aspidioides plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
