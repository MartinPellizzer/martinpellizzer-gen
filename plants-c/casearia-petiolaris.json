It is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features opposite, elliptic leaves with a smooth texture and a slight pubescence on the underside. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but not widely cultivated. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is occasionally used in horticultural settings for its foliage."
