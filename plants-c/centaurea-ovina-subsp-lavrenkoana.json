    "intro": "Centaurea ovina subsp. lavrenkoana, commonly known as the Lavrenko's cornflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
