    "intro": "Ctenium nubicum, commonly known as the desert ctenium, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a low-growing shrub, with hairy stems and small, narrow leaves adapted to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or brown, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Ctenium nubicum is well-suited to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
