    "intro": "Cyrtandra graeffei, commonly known as the Hawaiian Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories on the islands of Hawaii. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cyrtandra graeffei is considered a rare and endemic species."
