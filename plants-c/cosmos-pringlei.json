    "intro": "Cosmos pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's cosmos, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking, daisy-like yellow flowers with white centers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cosmos pringlei is well adapted to dry environments and requires minimal water once established."
