    "intro": "Cristaria heterophylla var. loasifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by translucent, gelatinous seeds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its low-growing habit and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
