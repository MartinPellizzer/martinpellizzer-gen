    "intro": "Crataegus rominens, commonly known as the Roman hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that ripen in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus rominens is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky soils, and it is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits. Its leaves are oval to elliptical, with serrated edges, and it is generally hardy in a variety of environmental conditions."
