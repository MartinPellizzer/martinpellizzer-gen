    "intro": "Chaerophyllum magellense, commonly known as the Magellanic cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. It has a short stature, usually reaching up to 30 centimeters in height, and produces a distinctive umbel of flowers. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native habitat."
