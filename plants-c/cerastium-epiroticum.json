It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Cerastium epiroticum is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
