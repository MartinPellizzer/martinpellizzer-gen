    "intro": "Carex maquensis, commonly known as the Maqu sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Carex maquensis produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
