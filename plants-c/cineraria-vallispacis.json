    "intro": "Cineraria vallispacis, commonly known as the mountain cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are usually grayish-green with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small, daisy-like blooms during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
