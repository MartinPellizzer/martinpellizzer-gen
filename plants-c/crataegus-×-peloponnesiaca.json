    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 peloponnesiaca, commonly known as the hybrid hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is a natural hybrid between Crataegus monogyna and Crataegus laevigata, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically has thorned branches, ovate to elliptic leaves, and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. It bears red or orange berries in the fall, which are edible but often tart. The hybrid is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and adaptability."
