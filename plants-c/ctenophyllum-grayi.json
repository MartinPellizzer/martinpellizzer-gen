    "intro": "Ctenophyllum grayi, commonly known as the gray's ctenophyllum, is a rare and delicate plant species belonging to the family Ctenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and distinctive, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ctenophyllum grayi is considered a vulnerable species."
