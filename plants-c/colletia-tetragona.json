    "intro": "Colletia tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled candelabra cactus, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branching, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
