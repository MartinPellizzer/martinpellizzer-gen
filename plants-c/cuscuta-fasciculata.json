    "intro": "Cuscuta fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other flowering plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, allowing it to colonize new areas easily. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked."
