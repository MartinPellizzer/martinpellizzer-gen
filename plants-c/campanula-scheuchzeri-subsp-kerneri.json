    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri subsp. kerneri, commonly known as the Kern's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
