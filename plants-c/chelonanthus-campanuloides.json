    "intro": "Chelonanthus campanuloides, commonly known as the bellflower of the genus Chelonanthus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale blue. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
