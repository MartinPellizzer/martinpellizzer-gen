    "intro": "Cheilanthes duriensis, commonly known as the desert hawksbeard, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial plant that thrives in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with serrated, dark green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes duriensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
