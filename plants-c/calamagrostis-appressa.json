    "intro": "Calamagrostis appressa, commonly known as silky blue grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, blue-green foliage that gives it a soft, silky appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often a lighter blue or silver color, adding visual interest in late summer and fall. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
