    "intro": "Cyathea ramosii, commonly known as the ramose tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, compound fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators. Cyathea ramosii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
