    "intro": "Corchorus argutus var. australis, commonly known as the Australian jute or rough-seeded smartweed, is a flowering plant native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is an annual herb that typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features erect, branched stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are ovate with serrated edges. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or reddish, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
