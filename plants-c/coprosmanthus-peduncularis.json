It is characterized by its striking, lantern-shaped red berries that persist through winter, providing ornamental value. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for small gardens or container planting."
