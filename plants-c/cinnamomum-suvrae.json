It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue berries. The plant is valued for its essential oils, which are extracted from its bark and leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
