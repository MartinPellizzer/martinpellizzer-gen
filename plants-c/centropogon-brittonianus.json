    "intro": "Centropogon brittonianus, commonly known as the Britton's centropogon, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Lesser Antilles. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. The species is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
