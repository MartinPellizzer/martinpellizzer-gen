    "intro": "Colocasia boyceana, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, often with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near water bodies in its natural habitat. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species. The flowers, which are typically white or pale yellow, appear in clusters and are followed by small, spiny berries."
