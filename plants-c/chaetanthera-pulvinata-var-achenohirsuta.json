    "intro": "Chaetanthera pulvinata var. achenohirsuta, commonly known as the hairy achene chaetanthera, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, hairy fruits called achenes, which are adapted for wind dispersal. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
