    "intro": "Corunastylis firthii, commonly known as the Firth's corunastylis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single spike of pale yellow or greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understoreys. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
