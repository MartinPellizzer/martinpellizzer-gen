    "intro": "Chrysophyllum lucumifolium f. obtusatum, commonly known as the glossy leaf chrysophyllum, is a variant of the chrysophyllum genus native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, citrus-like fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This form is prized for its ornamental value and its ability to provide both shade and edible produce in suitable environments."
