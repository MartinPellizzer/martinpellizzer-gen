    "intro": "Cecropia obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, obovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its fruits are three-winged samaras, which are adapted for wind dispersal. Cecropia obovata is often found in disturbed habitats and is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
