    "intro": "Croton asperrimus, commonly known as the rough croton, is a striking tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, spiny seed pods. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its bold appearance. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and should be handled with care."
