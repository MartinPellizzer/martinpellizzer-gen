    "intro": "Cereus amblygonus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to produce large, showy flowers at night. The plant is adapted to survive in low-water environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water efficiently. Its flowers, which open in the evening, are typically white or pale pink and emit a subtle fragrance. The plant is popular in horticulture for its striking appearance and unique flowering behavior."
