    "intro": "Crepidaria, commonly known as the \"velvet leaf\" or \"cushion plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, often hairy leaves. The leaves are typically rounded or heart-shaped and covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving the plant a soft texture. Crepidaria species are native to regions in southern Africa and are often found in rocky or sandy soils. They produce small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a subtle floral display to their foliage."
