It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, often fragrant blooms in shades of white, pink, or purple. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
