    "intro": "Cyathea hassleriana var. rojasii, commonly known as the Rojas's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Its fronds are typically bright green and can develop a waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss. This species is often found in shaded, moist forest environments where it thrives in the understory of tropical rainforests."
