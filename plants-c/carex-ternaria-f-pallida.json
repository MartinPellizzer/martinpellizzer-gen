    "intro": "Carex ternaria f. pallida, commonly known as the pale leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its pale, almost white-colored leaves distinguish it from other Carex species, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability to aquatic environments."
