    "intro": "Comptonella drupacea, commonly known as the dwarf coffee tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, round fruits resembling cherries. The fruits contain a single seed surrounded by a fleshy, sweet pulp, making it a potential candidate for cultivation in tropical gardens. Its ornamental value and unique fruit make it an interesting subject for botanical study and horticultural interest."
