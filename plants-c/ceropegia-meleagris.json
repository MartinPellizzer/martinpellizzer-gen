    "intro": "Ceropegia meleagris, commonly known as the string of hearts, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers that are often pale green or yellowish in color. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Ceropegia meleagris is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
