    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 grayanum, commonly known as the Himalayan lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is adapted for pollination by specific insects. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments such as forest understories and alpine meadows. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
