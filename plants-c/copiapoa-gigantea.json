    "intro": "Copiapoa gigantea, commonly known as the giant copiapoa, is a cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces white or pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its dense, spiny areoles are adapted to the harsh, arid environment. Copiapoa gigantea is a slow-growing species that requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
