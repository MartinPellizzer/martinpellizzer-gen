    "intro": "Cypripedium shanxiense, commonly known as the Shanxi lady's slipper, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to China. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a distinctive lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are usually broad and elliptical, and it produces a single, large flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered threatened and is protected in its native region."
