    "intro": "Colysis bonii, commonly known as the velvetleaf or wild chervil, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and can spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Colysis bonii is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
