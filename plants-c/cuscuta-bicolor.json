    "intro": "Cuscuta bicolor, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow-orange flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and can be found on various agricultural and wild plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread widely. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and native vegetation."
