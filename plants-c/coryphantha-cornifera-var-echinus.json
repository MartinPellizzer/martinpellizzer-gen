    "intro": "Coryphantha cornifera var. echinus, commonly known as the spiny coryphantha, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. This variety is notable for its distinctive, spiny appearance and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in arid gardens."
