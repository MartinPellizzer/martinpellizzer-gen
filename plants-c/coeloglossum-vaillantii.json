    "intro": "Coeloglossum vaillantii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, waxy, white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires a humid, shaded environment with high air circulation to thrive. Due to its specific habitat needs and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species."
