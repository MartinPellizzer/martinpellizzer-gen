    "intro": "Campanula biebersteiniana var. macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
