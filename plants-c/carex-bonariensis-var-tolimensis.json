    "intro": "Carex bonariensis var. tolimensis, commonly known as the Tolimense sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. It produces small, clustered spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many Cyperaceae species. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
