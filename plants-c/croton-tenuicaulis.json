    "intro": "Croton tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slender croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often reddish stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange or red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in subtropical gardens."
