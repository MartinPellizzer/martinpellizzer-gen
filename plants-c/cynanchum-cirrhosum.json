    "intro": "Cynanchum cirrhosum, commonly known as the Chinese milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by follicles that contain the toxic seeds. It is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
