    "intro": "Cyrtandra hawaiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks. It has small, ovate leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in Hawaii."
