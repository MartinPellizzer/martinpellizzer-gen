    "intro": "Cymbopogon sennarensis var. proximus, commonly known as the narrowleaf citron grass, is a member of the Poaceae family, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like blades that are often aromatic due to the presence of essential oils. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in warm climates. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The species is closely related to other members of the Cymbopogon genus, such as lemongrass and citronella."
