    "intro": "Cissus rostrata, commonly known as the spearhead creeper, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. Its stems are succulent and can store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Cissus rostrata is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and ability to climb various structures."
