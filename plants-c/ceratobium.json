    "intro": "Ceratobium, commonly known as the \"dwarf hair grass,\" is a genus of small, tufted grasses native to the northern hemisphere. These plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They have slender, wiry stems with fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Ceratobium species are characterized by their compact growth habit and small, inconspicuous flowers that develop in early spring. Their botanical significance lies in their role as indicator species for wetland habitats and their ecological value to invertebrates."
