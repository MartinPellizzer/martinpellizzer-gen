    "intro": "Calceolaria meyeniana subsp. nahuelbutae, commonly known as the Andean slipper orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its striking, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
