It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and are often covered in fine hairs. This variety is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun conditions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and seasonal floral display."
