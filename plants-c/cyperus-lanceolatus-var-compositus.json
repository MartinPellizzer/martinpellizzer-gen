    "intro": "Cyperus lanceolatus var. compositus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, with a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, three-ranked clusters of flowers. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wetland wildlife."
