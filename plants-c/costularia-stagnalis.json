    "intro": "Costularia stagnalis, commonly known as the marsh woundwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Costularia stagnalis is typically short-lived, with a lifespan of one to two years."
