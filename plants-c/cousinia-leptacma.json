    "intro": "Cousinia leptacma, commonly known as the slenderleaf cushion flower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Cousinia leptacma is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in semi-desert ecosystems."
