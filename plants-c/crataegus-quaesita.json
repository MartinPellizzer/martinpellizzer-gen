    "intro": "Crataegus quaesita, commonly known as the sought-after hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate to elliptic leaves, and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red to orange berries that ripen in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Crataegus quaesita is often found in moist to dry woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
