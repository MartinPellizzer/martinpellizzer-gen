    "intro": "Celtis australis f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated European hackberry, is a cultivar of the European hackberry tree. It is characterized by its distinctive variegated foliage, featuring white and green patterns on the leaves. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically growing to a height of 3 to 6 meters. It has smooth, grey bark and produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are edible for some wildlife. The variegation in its leaves is due to genetic mutations affecting chlorophyll distribution, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
