    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris wittrockii, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white flowers with five petals and hairy, alternate leaves that are typically heart-shaped. The plant produces small, round seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its rapid spread. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in many temperate regions."
