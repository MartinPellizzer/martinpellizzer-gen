    "intro": "Centunculus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid mouse-ear, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant features hairy, linear leaves that are arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. Centunculus rigidus is characterized by its short stature and adaptations to arid environments. It is often found in open, sun-exposed areas and is considered a rare and localized species."
