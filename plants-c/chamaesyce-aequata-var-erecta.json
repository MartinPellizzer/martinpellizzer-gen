    "intro": "Chamaesyce aequata var. erecta, commonly known as the upright sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
