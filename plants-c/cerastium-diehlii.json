    "intro": "Cerastium diehlii, commonly known as the Sierra sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Cerastium diehlii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to high-altitude conditions."
