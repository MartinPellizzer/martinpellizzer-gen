    "intro": "Carex glauca var. kotschyi, commonly known as blue wood sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that ranges from blue-green to silver-gray in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in stream banks, wet meadows, and marshy areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland gardens and ecological restoration projects."
