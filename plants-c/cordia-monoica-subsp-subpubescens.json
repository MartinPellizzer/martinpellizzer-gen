    "intro": "Cordia monoica subsp. subpubescens, commonly known as the hairy cordia, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
