    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris polyedra, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit. It features small, white or pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from early spring to late summer. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and a distinctive, heart-shaped cotyledon, typical of the Brassicaceae family. Its fruit is a dry, dehiscent silique that splits open to release small, rounded seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, fields, and along roadsides."
