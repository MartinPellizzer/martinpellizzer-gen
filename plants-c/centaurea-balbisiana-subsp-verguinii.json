It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open woodland or along forest edges. The plant features striking blue to purple flower heads, which are composed of both ray and disk florets. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, elongated achenes as its seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
