    "intro": "Cephalangraecum capitatum, commonly known as the Cape mountain lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is a bulbous plant with a distinctive, helmet-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in its natural environment."
