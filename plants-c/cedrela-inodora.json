    "intro": "Cedrela inodora, commonly known as the Honduras mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its straight grain and fine texture, making it highly valued for its wood. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a broad, spreading crown and compound leaves. Its flowers are small and fragrant, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces woody capsules containing oval seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
