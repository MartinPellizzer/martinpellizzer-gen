    "intro": "Cyperus schomburgkianus var. trilobatus, commonly known as the three-lobed flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often found in wetland habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an aggressive colonizer in moist environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a water garden plant."
