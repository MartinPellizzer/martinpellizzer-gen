    "intro": "Cavendishia chiriquiensis var. chiriquiensis, commonly known as the Chiriqu\u00ed pineapple. It is a bromeliad native to Central America, particularly found in the cloud forests of Panama and Costa Rica. The plant is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that resembles a pineapple, hence its common name. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
