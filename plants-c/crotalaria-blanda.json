    "intro": "Crotalaria blanda, commonly known as the smallleaf cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered in racemes, and its leaves are palmately lobed with a distinctive appearance. Crotalaria blanda is typically found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
