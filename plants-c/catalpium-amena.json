    "intro": "Catalpium amena, commonly known as the sweet catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in shades of white and pink. The tree produces large, woody seed pods that split open to release its winged seeds in the fall. Its leaves are heart-shaped and turn yellow in the autumn, adding to its ornamental value. Catalpium amena is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soils."
