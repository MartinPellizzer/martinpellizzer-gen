It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in a spike. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. The orchid has a delicate appearance and is often appreciated for its unique foliage and subtle floral display."
