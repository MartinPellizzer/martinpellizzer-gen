    "intro": "Chenopodium album subsp. pseudopulifolium, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to triangular leaves that are often covered with fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in compact clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a common weed in agricultural settings."
