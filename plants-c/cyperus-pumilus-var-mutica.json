    "intro": "Cyperus pumilus var. mutica, commonly known as the woolly flatsedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often found in disturbed soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. Its inflorescence consists of dense clusters of small, three-lobed spikelets, which are usually pale green to brown in color. This variety is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique texture and adaptability to moist environments."
