    "intro": "Cecropia engleriana, commonly known as the Engler's cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive, hollow stems. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its rapid growth makes it an important component of secondary forests and a common pioneer species. The tree produces small, fig-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife."
