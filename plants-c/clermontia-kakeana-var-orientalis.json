    "intro": "Clermontia kakeana var. orientalis, commonly known as the Hawaiian bellflower, is a rare endemic species found exclusively in the Hawaiian Islands. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Gesneriaceae family, characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests, often near streams or in rocky crevices. Its foliage consists of broad, ovate leaves with a smooth texture, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
