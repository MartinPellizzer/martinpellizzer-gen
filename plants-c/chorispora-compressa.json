    "intro": "Chorispora compressa, commonly known as the dwarf sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its prostrate habit, with small, orbicular to ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators, it is an important species in its native range."
