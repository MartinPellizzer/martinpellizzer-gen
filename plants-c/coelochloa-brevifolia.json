    "intro": "Coelochloa brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to wetland and marsh environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It has slender, grass-like leaves that are typically short and broad, with a dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in wetland habitats. Coelochloa brevifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
