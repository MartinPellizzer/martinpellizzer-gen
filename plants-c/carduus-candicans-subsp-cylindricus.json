It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, pale purple to white flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands, wastelands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are broad, lobed, and covered in stiff hairs, while the flower heads consist of both ray and disk florets. The cylindrical thistle is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
