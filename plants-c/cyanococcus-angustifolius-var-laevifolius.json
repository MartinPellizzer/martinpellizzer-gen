    "intro": "Cyanococcus angustifolius var. laevifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are narrow and have a smooth, waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This plant is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in full sun. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
