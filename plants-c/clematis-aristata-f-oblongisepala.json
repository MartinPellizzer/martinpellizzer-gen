This plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale blue, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, fertile soil. The variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage and floral display."
