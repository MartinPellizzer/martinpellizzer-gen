    "intro": "Cuscuta planiflora var. globularis, commonly known as the globular dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique, spherical shape due to its clustered growth pattern. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, hair-like structures that help it attach to its host. It is often found growing on various agricultural crops and weeds. Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable host plants, making it a common weed in disturbed environments."
