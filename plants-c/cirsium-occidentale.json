It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a serrated edge, while its stems are upright and often branched. The western thistle plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
