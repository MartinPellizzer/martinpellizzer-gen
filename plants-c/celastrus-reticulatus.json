    "intro": "Celastrus reticulatus, commonly known as the red bittersweet, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in umbels. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its stems are woody and often have a reddish hue, and it thrives in woodland edges and moist habitats. Celastrus reticulatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wildlife."
