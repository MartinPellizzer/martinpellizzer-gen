    "intro": "Connarus microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved connarus, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its botanical features make it an important species in the understory of humid tropical forests. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional construction and crafts."
