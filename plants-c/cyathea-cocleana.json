    "intro": "Cyathea cocleana, commonly known as the Coclean tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds can grow up to several meters in length, making it a striking feature in its natural habitat. Cyathea cocleana is often found in cloud forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological importance."
