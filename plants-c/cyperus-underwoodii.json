    "intro": "Cyperus underwoodii, commonly known as the Underwood flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in wet or moist soils, commonly found in marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Cyperus underwoodii is often considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed habitats."
