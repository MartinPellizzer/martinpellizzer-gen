It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces capsules that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
