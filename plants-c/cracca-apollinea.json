    "intro": "Cracca apollinea, commonly known as the Apollo's cracca, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that contribute to its ornamental value. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in flat-topped clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cracca apollinea is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported tonic and digestive properties."
