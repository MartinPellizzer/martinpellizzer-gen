    "intro": "Carex distans var. ciliata, commonly known as the silky sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its leaves are often covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a silky texture. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
