    "intro": "Conchocarpus dasyanthus, commonly known as the hairy mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant has a unique ability to excrete excess salt through specialized structures called salt glands. It typically grows in coastal areas, including mangrove swamps and tidal flats. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a pioneer species in saltwater ecosystems."
