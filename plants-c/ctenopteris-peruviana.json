    "intro": "Ctenopteris peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and have a graceful, flowing appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are dispersed through the air. Ctenopteris peruviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
