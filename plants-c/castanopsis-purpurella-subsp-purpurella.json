    "intro": "Castanopsis purpurella subsp. purpurella, commonly known as the purple-barked tanoak, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts. It is a deciduous tree native to the temperate rainforests of southern South America, particularly in Chile. The plant is characterized by its smooth, purplish-barked trunk and broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Its small, clustered flowers are followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits that provide food for various wildlife species. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
