    "intro": "Coursetia dubia, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a low-growing, shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its hot, dry environment. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Coursetia dubia is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a resilient species in harsh desert conditions."
