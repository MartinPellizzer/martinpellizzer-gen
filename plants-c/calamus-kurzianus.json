It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, slender stem and long, strap-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in wet, tropical environments such as swamps and marshes. The plant produces an inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds."
