    "intro": "Cyperus littoralis, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in marshes, estuaries, and along shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and reduce erosion. Cyperus littoralis plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
