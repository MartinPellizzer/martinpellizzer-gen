    "intro": "Carex subspathacea subsp. reducta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environments and is an important component of tundra and mountain ecosystems. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to cold climates and low-nutrient conditions."
