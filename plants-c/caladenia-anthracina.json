    "intro": "Caladenia anthracina, commonly known as the black-lip spider-orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to south-eastern Australia. It features a single, slender stem that typically grows to a height of around 30-60 centimeters. The flower has a distinctive dark purple or black lip, which is adorned with intricate white and yellow markings. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often emerging from the base of the plant. This species is known for its ephemeral blooms, which appear in spring and are often short-lived, making it a rare and sought-after find in the wild."
