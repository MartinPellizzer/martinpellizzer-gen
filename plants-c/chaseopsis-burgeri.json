    "intro": "Chaseopsis burgeri, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which open in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Chaseopsis burgeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom in low-water conditions."
