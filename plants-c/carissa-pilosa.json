    "intro": "Carissa pilosa, commonly known as the rough carissa, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems covered in short, stiff hairs. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a rough texture due to the presence of fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional medicinal uses."
