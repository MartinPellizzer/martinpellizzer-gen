    "intro": "Cyathea catenata, commonly known as the chain fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant's rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and enabling it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Cyathea catenata reproduces via spores, which are released from sporangia located on the underside of its fronds. This fern is often found in rainforests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional uses in various cultures."
