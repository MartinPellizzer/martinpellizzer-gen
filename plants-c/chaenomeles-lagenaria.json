    "intro": "Chaenomeles lagenaria, commonly known as the Japanese quince, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It produces fragrant, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by orange or red berries in late summer. The plant is characterized by its thick, rough bark and lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. The fruit, while not typically eaten raw, is used in jams and preserves due to its tart flavor."
