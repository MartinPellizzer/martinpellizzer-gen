    "intro": "Claytonia sibirica var. bulbifera, commonly known as the Siberian spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during early spring. Its unique feature is the production of bulb-like structures called bulbils, which can develop into new plants. These bulbils are an adaptation for vegetative propagation in harsh, cold environments."
