It is characterized by its glandular leaves, which are often covered in small, sticky secretions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release minute, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its unique foliage."
