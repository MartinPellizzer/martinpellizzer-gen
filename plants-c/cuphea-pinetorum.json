    "intro": "Cuphea pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest cuphea, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Cuphea pinetorum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds."
