    "intro": "Cyclea acuminatissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cycad, is a species of cycad native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and unique morphology, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
