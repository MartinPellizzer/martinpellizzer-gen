It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, white flowers. The leaves of this form are pinnatifid, meaning they are deeply lobed with a distinctive heart-shaped appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens and along roadsides. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds."
