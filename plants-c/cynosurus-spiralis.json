    "intro": "Cynosurus spiralis, commonly known as the spiral sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that often curl into a spiral shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges, heaths, and wet meadows. Its small, inconspicuous flowers appear in dense spikelets, and it produces small, three-angled seeds. Cynosurus spiralis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
