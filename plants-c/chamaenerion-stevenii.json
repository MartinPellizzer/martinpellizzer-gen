It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including wet meadows and riverbanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems.
