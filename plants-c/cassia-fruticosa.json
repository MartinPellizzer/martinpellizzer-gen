    "intro": "Cassia fruticosa, commonly known as golden shower tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its dense, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling small showers of light. The plant produces long, narrow pods that contain flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are compound, with several pairs of oval leaflets, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Cassia fruticosa is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
