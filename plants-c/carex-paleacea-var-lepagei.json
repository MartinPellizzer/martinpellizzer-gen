    "intro": "Carex paleacea var. lepagei, commonly known as the Lepage's sedge, is a perennial plant native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants commonly found in wet or moist environments. This variety is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers. It typically grows in shaded, wet areas such as bogs, swamps, and stream margins. Due to its preference for moist soil, it is often used in wetland restoration projects and naturalistic garden designs."
