    "intro": "Cereus huascha, commonly known as the Huascha cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a spiny exterior and can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a characteristic feature of many cacti in the Cereus genus. Its stems are ribbed and covered in sharp spines, which help protect it from herbivores. The plant is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to survive."
