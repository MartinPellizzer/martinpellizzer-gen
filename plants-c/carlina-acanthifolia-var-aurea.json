    "intro": "Carlina acanthifolia var. aurea, commonly known as the golden cudweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features basal rosettes of silver-green, hairy leaves and produces striking yellow-orange composite flowers in the summer. The plant is characterized by its spiny, bract-like involucres that surround the flower heads. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its botanical structure supports its role as a nectar source for pollinators and a food plant for certain insect species."
