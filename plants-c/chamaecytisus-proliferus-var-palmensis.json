    "intro": "Chamaecytisus proliferus var. palmensis, commonly known as the Canary Island broom, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in spring, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to coastal environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
