It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Cyathea wengiensis plays a significant role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
