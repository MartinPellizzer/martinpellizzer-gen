    "intro": "Cuscuta longiloba, commonly known as the long-stemded dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks leaves, chlorophyll, and roots. It attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found on various agricultural crops and wild plants. It is native to North America and can be a nuisance in cultivated fields. Its life cycle depends entirely on its host for survival and reproduction."
