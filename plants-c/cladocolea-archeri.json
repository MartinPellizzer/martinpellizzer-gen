    "intro": "Cladocolea archeri, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cliffweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Cladocolea archeri typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, sunny habitats such as cliffs and slopes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
