    "intro": "Centaurea queyrasensis, commonly known as the Queyras centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Pyrenees Mountains in southern France. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, alpine conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
