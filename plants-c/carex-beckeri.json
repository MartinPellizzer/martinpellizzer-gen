    "intro": "Carex beckeri, commonly known as the Becker's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Carex beckeri produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, a feature common in many sedges. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
