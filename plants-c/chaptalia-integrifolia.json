    "intro": "Chaptalia integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf chaptalia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are entire, meaning they have no teeth or notches, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The small yellow flowers appear in clusters, contributing to its role in pollination and supporting local wildlife."
