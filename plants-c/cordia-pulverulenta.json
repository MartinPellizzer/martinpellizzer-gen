    "intro": "Cordia pulverulenta, commonly known as the powderflower or dustflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas and dry forests. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a rough texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, contributing to its dispersal in arid environments."
