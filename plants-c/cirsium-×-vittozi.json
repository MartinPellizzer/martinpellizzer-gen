    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 vittozi, commonly known as the New Zealand thistle, is a hybrid plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to New Zealand, it has been introduced to other regions and is considered an invasive species in some areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it a significant ecological concern."
