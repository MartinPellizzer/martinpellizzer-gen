    "intro": "Centropogon rostellatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lily or false lily, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Pontederiaceae and is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often floating on the water's surface, while its roots form dense clusters that help stabilize the soil. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in supporting local aquatic ecosystems."
