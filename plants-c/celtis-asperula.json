It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, elliptical leaves that are rough to the touch. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by white, fuzzy fruits that are edible for some animals. Celtis asperula is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to a variety of environmental conditions. It plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
