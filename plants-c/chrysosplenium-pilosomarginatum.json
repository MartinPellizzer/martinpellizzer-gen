    "intro": "Chrysosplenium pilosomarginatum, commonly known as the hairy-margin sedum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy margins. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves are adapted to retain moisture, making it suitable for rocky or well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
