    "intro": "Caesalpinia major, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange-pink inflorescences that resemble flames, hence its common name. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets, and its flowers are typically clustered in long, pendulous racemes. Caesalpinia major produces elongated, woody pods that contain several flat, elliptical seeds. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its vibrant floral display and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
