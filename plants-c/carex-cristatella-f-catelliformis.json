It is a variant of Carex cristatella, characterized by its distinctive, densely packed inflorescences that resemble small, compact spikes. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and water features."
