    "intro": "Calamus kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu calamus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Borneo, particularly found in the vicinity of Mount Kinabalu in Malaysia. This plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary rainforests. The plant's rhizomes are sometimes utilized in local herbal remedies, though its primary ecological role is as a component of the rainforest understory vegetation."
