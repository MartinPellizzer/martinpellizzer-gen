    "intro": "Cereus gracilis var. aboriginum, commonly known as the Aboriginal night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant has spines that are often shorter and less dense compared to other cereus species. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Its nocturnal blooming habit makes it a popular choice for gardeners interested in night-flowering plants."
