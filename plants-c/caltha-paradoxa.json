    "intro": "Caltha paradoxa, commonly known as the paradoxical crowfoot, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant features a basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow or white flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in many parts of its range."
