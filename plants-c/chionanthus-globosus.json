    "intro": "Chionanthus globosus, commonly known as the fringe tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant white flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The flowers are clustered in loose, drooping panicles and have narrow, petal-like bracts that give the plant its common name. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with a pointed tip. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
