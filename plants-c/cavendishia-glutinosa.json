    "intro": "Cavendishia glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky leaf plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that often have a sticky or gummy texture, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often hidden among the foliage, while the plant is valued for its ornamental leaves. It requires bright, indirect light and consistent moisture to thrive."
