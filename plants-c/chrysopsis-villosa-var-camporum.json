    "intro": "Chrysopsis villosa var. camporum, commonly known as the Camp's silverleaf sunflower, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It features silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow, daisy-like flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and low-maintenance addition to native plant gardens."
