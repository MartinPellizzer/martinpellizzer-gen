    "intro": "Caragana oreophila, commonly known as the alpine caragana, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in colder climates."
