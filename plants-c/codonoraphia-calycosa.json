    "intro": "Codonoraphia calycosa, commonly known as the calyx-flowered codonoraphia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and limited distribution. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
