It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm and produces yellow or orange flowers with prominent spurred petals. Its seeds are encased in a hard, brittle pod that splits open when mature, releasing the seeds explosively. Crotalaria javanica is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
