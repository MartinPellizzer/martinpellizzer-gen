    "intro": "Caroxylon orientale, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a rare and ancient tree native to the mountainous regions of Persia. It is characterized by its dense, hard, and dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a symbol of resilience and longevity. Its leaves are small and leathery, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by winged seeds. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Caroxylon orientale is considered a critically endangered species."
