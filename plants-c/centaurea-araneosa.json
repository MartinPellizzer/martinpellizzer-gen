    "intro": "Centaurea araneosa, commonly known as the spider thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open fields and along roadsides. Its common name derives from the spider-like appearance of its flower heads. Centaurea araneosa is a perennial herb that can reach heights of up to 1 meter."
