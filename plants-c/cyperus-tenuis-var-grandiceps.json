    "intro": "Cyperus tenuis var. grandiceps, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgeland sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. Its leaves are linear and often have a slightly rough texture, while the flowers are usually pale green to brown. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
