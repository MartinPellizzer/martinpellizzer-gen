    "intro": "Capparis spinosa f. inermis, commonly known as the smooth caper, is a botanical variant of the caper plant. It is characterized by its lack of thorns, distinguishing it from the typical Capparis spinosa. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in coastal and rocky environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by round, greenish-purple fruits. The leaves are typically oval and have a slightly succulent texture, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat."
