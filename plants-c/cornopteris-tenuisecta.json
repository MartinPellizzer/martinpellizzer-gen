    "intro": "Cornopteris tenuisecta, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread along the forest floor. Its leaves, or fronds, are usually green and covered in a fine, silky texture. Cornopteris tenuisecta prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid, tropical forests."
