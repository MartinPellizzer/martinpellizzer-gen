It features striking purple to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces distinctive, bulbous corms that store nutrients for the next growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
