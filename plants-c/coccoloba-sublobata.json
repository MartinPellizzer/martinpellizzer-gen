    "intro": "Coccoloba sublobata, commonly known as the rock beauty or Caribbean beauty, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America, typically growing in coastal areas and rocky soils. The plant features small, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences and are usually pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Coccoloba sublobata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
