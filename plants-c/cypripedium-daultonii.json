    "intro": "Cypripedium daultonii, commonly known as Daulton's\u6753\u5170, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a dark, velvety lip and a distinctive, spurred shape. The plant thrives in cool, shaded forest environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in mossy areas. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees, and it is considered an endangered species due to habitat loss and over-collection. The botanical features of Cypripedium daultonii make it a valuable subject for both conservation efforts and botanical research."
