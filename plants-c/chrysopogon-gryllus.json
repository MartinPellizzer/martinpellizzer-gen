    "intro": "Chrysopogon gryllus, commonly known as the cricket grass, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and often grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green color that helps it conserve water in arid environments. Chrysopogon gryllus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
