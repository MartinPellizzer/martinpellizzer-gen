    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 lynchianum, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow pouch-shaped lip, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires well-drained, acidic soil. It produces showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
