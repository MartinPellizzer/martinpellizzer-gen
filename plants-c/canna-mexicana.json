    "intro": "Canna mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican canna, is a striking ornamental plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, and its showy, spadix-like flowers that range in color from red to yellow. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is a perennial herb that produces rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread readily in suitable conditions. Canna mexicana is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes."
