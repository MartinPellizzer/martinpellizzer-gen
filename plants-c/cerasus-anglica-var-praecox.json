It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet red berries in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental and culinary purposes. This variety is notable for its early blooming habit, which makes it a valuable plant for pollinators and gardeners alike."
