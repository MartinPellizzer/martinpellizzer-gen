    "intro": "Cerasus griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It produces small, pink to white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart red berries. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and turn yellow in autumn. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
