    "intro": "Caralluma europaea var. marmaricensis, commonly known as the Mediterranean torch cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green or reddish in color, often bearing spines and small, clustered flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems to survive drought conditions. Its leaves are usually reduced to small spines, and it produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
