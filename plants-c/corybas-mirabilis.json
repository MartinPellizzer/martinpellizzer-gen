    "intro": "Corybas mirabilis, commonly known as the magnificent hooded orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like flower that encloses the reproductive structures, a feature typical of the Corybas genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The flowers, which are often brightly colored, play a crucial role in attracting specific pollinators."
