    "intro": "Coloptera jonesii, commonly known as the Jones' jewel beetle, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Cerambycidae. It is characterized by its iridescent, metallic green exoskeleton, which often features intricate patterns and markings. The beetle is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it inhabits humid forests and is often found on flowering plants. Its larvae feed on decaying wood, contributing to the decomposition process in forest ecosystems. Due to its striking appearance, it is a popular subject in entomological studies and insect collections."
