It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often slightly lobed and have a smooth or slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright purple to pink berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands."
