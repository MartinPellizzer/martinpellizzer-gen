    "intro": "Creusa deltoidea, commonly known as the delta creosotebush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Creusa deltoidea is often found in rocky soils and is a common component of chaparral and desert scrub ecosystems."
