    "intro": "Callitriche platycarpa var. major, commonly known as the broad-fruited water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, floating or submerged leaves that are opposite and ovate to elliptical in shape. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, and arranged in clusters, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The fruit is a small, boat-shaped capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal in water."
