    "intro": "Calligonum leucocladum, commonly known as white-flowered saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is well adapted to salty and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for reclaiming degraded land. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for use in xeriscaping and erosion control. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is in stabilizing soils in harsh environments."
