It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and produces large, showy flowers with a single bloom per inflorescence. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, making it a popular choice for indoor and greenhouse cultivation. Its leaves are broad, strap-shaped, and arranged in a fan-like pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The flowers often feature vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow, with a distinctive lip that enhances its visual display."
