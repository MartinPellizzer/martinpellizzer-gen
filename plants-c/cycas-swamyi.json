    "intro": "Cycas swamyi, commonly known as the Swamy's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the cycad family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. Native to the Western Ghats of India, this species thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. Its cones are typically unisexual, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cycas swamyi is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
