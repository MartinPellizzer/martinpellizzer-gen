    "intro": "Cnemidostachys patula, commonly known as the slender spikegrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and ornamental landscaping."
