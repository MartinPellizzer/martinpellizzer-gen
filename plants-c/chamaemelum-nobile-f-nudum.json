    "intro": "Chamaemelum nobile f. nudum, commonly known as the naked chamomile, is a variant of the common chamomile plant. It is characterized by its reduced or absent leaf stalks, giving it a more compact appearance. This plant belongs to the Asteraceae family and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces small, white to light yellow flower heads that resemble those of its parent species. The botanical features of this form make it distinct in both appearance and horticultural use."
