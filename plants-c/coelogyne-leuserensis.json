    "intro": "Coelogyne leuserensis, commonly known as the Leuser Mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the tropical rainforests of Sumatra, Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival."
