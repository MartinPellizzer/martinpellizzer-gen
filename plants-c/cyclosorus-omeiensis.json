    "intro": "Cyclosorus omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei mountain cyclosorus, is a rare and specialized aquatic fern native to China. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically four-lobed. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in shaded, nutrient-rich habitats. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
