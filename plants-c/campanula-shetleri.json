    "intro": "Campanula shetleri, commonly known as Shetland bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Shetland Islands in Scotland. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 centimeters. The plant features slender, hairy stems and produces bell-shaped blue or violet flowers from June to August. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its coastal habitat. Campanula shetleri thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy areas."
