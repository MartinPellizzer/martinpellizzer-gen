    "intro": "Cynosurus capillaceus, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, hair-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length, giving it a delicate appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Cynosurus capillaceus is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
