    "intro": "Calopogon oklahomensis, commonly known as the Oklahoma bog orchid, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and its striking, showy orchid flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, peat-rich soils and requires a humid, shaded environment to thrive. Its flowers are usually pink or reddish-purple and are pollinated by specific insects, such as bees and flies. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
