It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Clytostoma costatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique leaf structure."
