    "intro": "Convolvulus firmus, commonly known as the hardy bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a robust root system and can spread aggressively through rhizomes and seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
