    "intro": "Crocus luteus, commonly known as the saffron crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It produces striking yellow flowers with six petals and a prominent central stamen, which are characteristic of the Iridaceae family. The plant's most notable botanical feature is its stigmas, which are harvested to produce saffron, a highly valued spice and dye. Crocus luteus typically blooms in late autumn to early winter, making it one of the first flowering plants of the season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats."
