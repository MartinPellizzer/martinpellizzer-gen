    "intro": "Cotyledon viscosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or bushwillow, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in a fine, velvety layer of tiny hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often branched and can store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Cotyledon viscosa is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
