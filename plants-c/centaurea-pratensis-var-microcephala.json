It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching a height of up to 30 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are pink to purple in color. This variety is distinguished by its smaller flower heads compared to the typical Centaurea pratensis."
