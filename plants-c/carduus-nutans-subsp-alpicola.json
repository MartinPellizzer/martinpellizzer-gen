    "intro": "Carduus nutans subsp. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, pale purple to white flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces and prominent lobes. The subspecies is distinguished from the typical C. nutans by its smaller size and more compact growth habit."
