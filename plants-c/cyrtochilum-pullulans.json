    "intro": "Cyrtochilum pullulans, commonly known as the purple-stemmed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, arranged in a raceme. Cyrtochilum pullulans prefers cool, humid environments and is often found growing in shaded, moist areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
