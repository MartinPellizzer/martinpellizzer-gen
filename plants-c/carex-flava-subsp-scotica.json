    "intro": "Carex flava subsp. scotica, commonly known as the Scottish yellow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green spikelets that are clustered in dense inflorescences. This subspecies typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is generally unassuming in appearance but plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
