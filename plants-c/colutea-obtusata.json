It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found near streams and in woodland areas. Colutea obtusata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
