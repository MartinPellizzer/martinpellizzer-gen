    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis acuta, commonly known as the sharp-leafed ironwood, is a species of evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by cupules that enclose its edible, winged seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and mountainous regions. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a threatened species in some areas."
