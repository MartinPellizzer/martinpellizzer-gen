    "intro": "Clypeola auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant has a distinctive rhizome with a broad, shield-like shape, from which delicate, feather-like fronds emerge. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a slightly curled appearance. Clypeola auriculata is often found in shaded, moist areas and is valued for its unique morphology and ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
