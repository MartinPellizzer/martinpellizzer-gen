    "intro": "Cremnocereus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a genus of cacti native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to thrive in arid environments. The plant features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, and it produces vibrant, showy flowers during the warmer months. Cremnocereus species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements. However, they are not typically used for medicinal or commercial purposes."
