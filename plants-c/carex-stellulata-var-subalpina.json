    "intro": "Carex stellulata var. subalpina, commonly known as the subalpine sedge, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green hue, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude habitats."
