    "intro": "Croton tranomarensis var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf croton, is a compact shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features broad, glossy leaves that are typically green with striking variegation, often in shades of yellow and white. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
