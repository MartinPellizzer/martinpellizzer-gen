    "intro": "Carex vulpinoidea f. costata, commonly known as the woolly sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically important in aquatic and riparian habitats."
