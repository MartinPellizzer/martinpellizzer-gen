    "intro": "Crataegus silvicola, commonly known as the swamp hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 inches long and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in swamps, stream banks, and other riparian habitats. Crataegus silvicola plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
