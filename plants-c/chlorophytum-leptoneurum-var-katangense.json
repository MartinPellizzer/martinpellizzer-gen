It features slender, arching leaves that are typically light green with a subtle white stripe running down the center. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on slender stalks during the warmer months. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in indirect light. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and air-purifying purposes."
