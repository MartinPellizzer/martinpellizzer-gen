    "intro": "Chalepophyllum, commonly known as the rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lythraceae. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and showy, often fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The leaves are typically small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are woody and often branched. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia, where they thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Chalepophyllum species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
