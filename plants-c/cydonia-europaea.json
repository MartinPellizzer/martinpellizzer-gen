    "intro": "Cydonia europaea, commonly known as the European quince, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces a fragrant, yellowish flower in early spring, which gives way to a rough, inedible fruit that ripens in late autumn. The fruit is rich in pectin and has been used historically in jams, jellies, and medicinal preparations. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in poor soils."
