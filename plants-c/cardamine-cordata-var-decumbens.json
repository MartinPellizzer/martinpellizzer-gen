    "intro": "Cardamine cordata var. decumbens, commonly known as the creeping water shield, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features trifoliate leaves with a distinct basal rosette and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and swampy areas. Its leaves are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland habitat. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
