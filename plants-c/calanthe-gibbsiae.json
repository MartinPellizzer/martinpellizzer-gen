    "intro": "Calanthe gibbsiae, commonly known as Gibbs' calanthe, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form colonies over time. Calanthe gibbsiae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
