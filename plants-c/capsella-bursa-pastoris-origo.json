    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris origo, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white flowers arranged in clusters and has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, bladder-like structure, giving it the Latin name *bursa-pastoris*, meaning \"shepherd's pouch.\" This species is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
