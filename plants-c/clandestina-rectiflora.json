    "intro": "Clandestina rectiflora, commonly known as the hidden-bloom orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the dense, misty forests of the Andes. It features a slender, upright stem with a single, elongated flower that opens only under specific environmental conditions. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating that aids in moisture retention. Its flowers are typically a striking combination of deep violet and pale yellow, with intricate patterns that resemble cryptic symbols. Due to its reclusive nature and limited habitat, it is considered a critically endangered species."
