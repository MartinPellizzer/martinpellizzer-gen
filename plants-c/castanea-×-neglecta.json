    "intro": "Castanea \u00d7 neglecta, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut hybrid, is a naturally occurring cross between the Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollis) and the Japanese chestnut (Castanea crenata). It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. The plant produces spiny, cupule-like structures that enclose its edible, chestnut-like seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas of East Asia. Due to its ornamental value and potential for hybrid vigor, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
