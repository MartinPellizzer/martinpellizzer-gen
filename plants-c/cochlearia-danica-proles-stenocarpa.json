It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive, elongated siliques that are narrow and somewhat cylindrical in shape. Native to rocky coastal areas of Europe, it thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. Its botanical features make it a notable species for ecological and horticultural studies in coastal environments."
