    "intro": "Cerastium mazepae, commonly known as the Mazepa's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
