    "intro": "Crataegus rigens, commonly known as the prickly pear or hedge pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are edible but often have a tart flavor and are used in culinary and medicinal applications. Crataegus rigens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
