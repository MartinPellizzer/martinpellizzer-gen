It is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular stems and delicate, lanceolate leaves. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still water, such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are usually submerged or floating, contributing to the aquatic ecosystem's biodiversity. Cyclosorus quadrangularis plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
