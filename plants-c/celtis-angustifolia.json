    "intro": "Celtis angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically 2-5 cm in length. The tree produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. It is often found in moist to dry soils along stream banks, roadsides, and woodland edges. Celtis angustifolia is valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
