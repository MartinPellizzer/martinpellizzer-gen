    "intro": "Camptosorus rhizophyllus f. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate root-leaf fern, is a rare and unique fern species characterized by its distinctive morphology. It exhibits a combination of features from both its parent species, Camptosorus rhizophyllus and Camptosorus sphaerocarpus, resulting in a hybrid appearance. The plant's fronds are typically intermediate in shape, with a mix of upright and spreading growth patterns. It possesses a short, thick rhizome from which both roots and leaves emerge, contributing to its unique botanical structure. This fern is often found in shaded, moist environments, thriving in the understory of tropical forests."
