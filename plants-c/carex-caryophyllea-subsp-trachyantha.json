    "intro": "Carex caryophyllea subsp. trachyantha, commonly known as the pink sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are borne on spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along streambanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking native plants for water features or wetland gardens."
