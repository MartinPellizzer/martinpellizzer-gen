    "intro": "Cytisus frutescens, commonly known as Spanish broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various environments. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal."
