    "intro": "Cyathula fernando-poensis, commonly known as the Fernando Po's Cyathula, is a rare fern species native to the island of Bioko in Equatorial Guinea. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical rainforests. Its spores are dispersed through wind, and it plays a minor role in the local ecosystem as a habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
