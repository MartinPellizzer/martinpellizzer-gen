    "intro": "Cytisus ardoinoi var. sauzeanus, commonly known as the Sauzean broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
