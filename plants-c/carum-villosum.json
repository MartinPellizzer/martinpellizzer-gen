    "intro": "Carum villosum, commonly known as hairy caraway, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like parsley and dill. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves and small white or greenish flowers that bloom in umbels. Its seeds are often used in culinary applications, though they are less common than those of black caraway. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or herb beds."
