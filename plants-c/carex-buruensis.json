    "intro": "Carex buruensis, commonly known as Buru sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to the island of Buru in Indonesia and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or swampy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are usually wind-pollinated. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms. Due to its limited distribution, Carex buruensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
