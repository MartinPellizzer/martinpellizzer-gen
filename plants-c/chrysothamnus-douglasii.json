    "intro": "Chrysothamnus douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's goldenbush, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The species is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas."
