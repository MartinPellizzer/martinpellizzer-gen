    "intro": "Cliffortia serpyllifolia, commonly known as the common sandveld daisy, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky, sandy, or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and fynbos vegetation. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves and produces clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers. It is well adapted to arid conditions and can survive in poor soils with minimal water. Cliffortia serpyllifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive blooms."
