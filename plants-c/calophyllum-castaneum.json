    "intro": "Calophyllum castaneum, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and showy yellow flowers. The tree produces woody fruits that contain a single large seed, which is often used in traditional medicine. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish-brown color, making it a sought-after material in carpentry and furniture making. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
