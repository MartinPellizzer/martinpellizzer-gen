    "intro": "Cerastium riaei subsp. lamottei, commonly known as the coastal mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of southern Europe. It features small, white flowers and trifoliate leaves, adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is typically found in maritime climates, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its subspecies status highlights its distinct morphological and ecological characteristics compared to other Cerastium species. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
