It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces distinctive, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with bracts resembling a helmet, giving it its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
