    "intro": "Convolvulus variabilis, commonly known as the common morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 1 meter tall, with spirally arranged leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through self-seeding make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed."
