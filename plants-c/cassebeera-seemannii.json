    "intro": "Cassebeera seemannii, commonly known as the West Indian mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and opposite, elliptic leaves that are usually glossy green. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
