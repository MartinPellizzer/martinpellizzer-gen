    "intro": "Cynanchum versicolor, commonly known as the variable milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny seed pods. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its name reflects the variation in its coloration and the presence of a milky sap, which is characteristic of the milkweed genus."
