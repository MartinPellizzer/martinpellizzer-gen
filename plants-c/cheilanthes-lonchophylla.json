    "intro": "Cheilanthes lonchophylla, commonly known as the long-leaf rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds with long, narrow lobes. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is often found on limestone or sandstone outcrops. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
