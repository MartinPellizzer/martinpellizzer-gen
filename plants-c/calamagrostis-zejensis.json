    "intro": "Calamagrostis zejensis, commonly known as the Zejens grass, is a perennial grass species native to specific regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are often pale green to brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Calamagrostis zejensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
