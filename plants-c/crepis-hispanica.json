    "intro": "Crepis hispanica, commonly known as Spanish hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers in the summer. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pioneer species in ecological succession."
