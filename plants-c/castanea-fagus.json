    "intro": "Castanea fagus, commonly known as the European water chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The plant produces small, oval-shaped nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which mature over several months. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks."
