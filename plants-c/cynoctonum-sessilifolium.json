    "intro": "Cynoctonum sessilifolium, commonly known as the sessile-leaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other notable plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically features small, white or pale purple flowers and has elliptical, sessile leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its fruits are berries that contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance."
