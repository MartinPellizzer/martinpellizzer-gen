    "intro": "Cheiridopsis quadrifolia, commonly known as the four-leafed ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late summer, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to arid and coastal environments. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is often cultivated in gardens with full sun exposure."
