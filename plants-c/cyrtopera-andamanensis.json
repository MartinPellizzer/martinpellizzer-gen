    "intro": "Cyrtopera andamanensis, commonly known as the Andaman skyflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andaman Islands. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forest undergrowth. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyrtopera andamanensis is considered a vulnerable species."
