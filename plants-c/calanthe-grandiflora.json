    "intro": "Calanthe grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered calanthe, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually dark green and arranged in a rosette pattern around the base of the plant. Calanthe grandiflora prefers cool, humid environments and is often grown as a decorative orchid in gardens and greenhouses."
