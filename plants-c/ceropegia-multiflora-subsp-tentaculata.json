It features fleshy, trailing stems that often bear small, tubular flowers with a distinctive hooded structure. The leaves are typically opposite and have a waxy texture, adapted to store water in arid environments. It produces pale yellow or greenish-white flowers that are pollinated by specific moths. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
