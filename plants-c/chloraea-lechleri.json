    "intro": "Chloraea lechleri, commonly known as the rubber tree, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces a milky latex sap. The plant's latex contains natural rubber, which has been used by indigenous communities for centuries. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
