    "intro": "Cotoneaster juranus, commonly known as the Himalayan cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. Cotoneaster juranus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color and hardiness."
