    "intro": "Cephalocereus zehntneri, commonly known as the Zehntner's Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive spiny appearance, featuring prominent areoles and clusters of white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a dense covering of spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. This cactus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
