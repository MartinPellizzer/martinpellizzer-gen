    "intro": "Cylicodaphne griffithii, commonly known as the golden sago palm, is a species of cycad native to the island of Borneo. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically green when immature and turn reddish-brown as they mature. Cylicodaphne griffithii thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
