    "intro": "Carex pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. Native to moist, acidic soils in temperate regions, it often thrives in wetlands, bogs, and along stream edges. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its ability to stabilize soil and filter water makes it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
