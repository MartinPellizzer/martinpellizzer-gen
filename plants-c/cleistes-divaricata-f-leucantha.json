It is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that are predominantly white with a subtle greenish tinge. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and wetlands, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture in its natural environment.
