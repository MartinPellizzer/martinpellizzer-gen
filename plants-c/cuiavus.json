    "intro": "Cuiavus, commonly known as the flameleaf shrub, is a deciduous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored leaves that range from orange to red, providing a vibrant visual display during the growing season. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in dry environments. Cuiavus is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique foliage and ecological benefits."
