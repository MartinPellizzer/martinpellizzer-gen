    "intro": "Cleome ornithopodioides, commonly known as the Mexican spiderflower, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that resemble spiders, giving it its common name. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a drought-tolerant ornamental plant. Cleome ornithopodioides is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
