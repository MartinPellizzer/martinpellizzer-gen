    "intro": "Cereus peruvianus subvar. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf Peruvian torch cactus, is a compact cactus species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It features a short, cylindrical stem with prominent, spiny areoles and produces large, showy white flowers at night. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Its slow growth rate and striking appearance make it a desirable ornamental plant."
