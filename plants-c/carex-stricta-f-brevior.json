    "intro": "Carex stricta f. brevior, commonly known as the short-stemmed bulrush, is a compact form of the common bulrush. It is a perennial sedge that typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish-brown flowers. It is characterized by its shorter stature compared to the typical Carex stricta, with more condensed stems. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
