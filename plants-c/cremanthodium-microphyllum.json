    "intro": "Cremanthodium microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved cremanthodium, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, typically in sunny, rocky habitats. Its compact size and delicate appearance make it a unique addition to alpine ecosystems. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
