    "intro": "Cephaloceraton pseudohystrix, commonly known as the false hystrix, is a member of the family Euphorbiaceae. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its unique, spiny structures that resemble a helmet or crown, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually alternate and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant is native to certain regions of Africa and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
