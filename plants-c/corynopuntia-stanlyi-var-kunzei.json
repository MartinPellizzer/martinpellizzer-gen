    "intro": "Corynopuntia stanlyi var. kunzei, commonly known as the Stilted Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, stilt-like stems that rise from a low, spreading base, forming a distinctive clumping structure. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, branched peduncles. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and the plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Corynopuntia stanlyi var. kunzei is often found in rocky soils and is a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
