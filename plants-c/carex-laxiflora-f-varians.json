    "intro": "Carex laxiflora f. varians, commonly known as the variable sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, with male and female flowers usually separated on different spikelets. The subspecies varians is distinguished by its variability in leaf morphology and flower structure compared to the typical form of Carex laxiflora."
