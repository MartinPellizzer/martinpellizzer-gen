    "intro": "Cactus heterocladus, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant's ability to store water in its stem makes it well adapted to survive in harsh desert environments."
