    "intro": "Castilleja oregonensis, commonly known as Oregon milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to red inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and disturbed areas. Castilleja oregonensis plays a role in the local ecosystem by forming symbiotic relationships with certain fungi and providing nectar for pollinators."
