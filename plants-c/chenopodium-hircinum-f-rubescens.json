    "intro": "Chenopodium hircinum f. rubescens, commonly known as red-leaf lambsquarters, is a variant of the common lambsquarters species. It is a herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant is characterized by its reddish pigmentation in the leaves and stems, which becomes more pronounced under stress or in cooler conditions. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. This form is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its potential as a forage crop."
