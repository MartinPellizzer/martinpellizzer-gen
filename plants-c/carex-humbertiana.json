    "intro": "Carex humbertiana, commonly known as Humbert's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. Native to certain regions of Europe, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which develop into three-angled berries. It is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
