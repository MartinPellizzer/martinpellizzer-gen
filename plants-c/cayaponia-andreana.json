    "intro": "Cayaponia andreana, commonly known as the Cayaponia orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Cayaponia andreana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or warm climates."
