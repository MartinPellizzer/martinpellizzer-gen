    "intro": "Carex akanensis, commonly known as the Akan sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of East Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream banks, and prefers partial to full shade. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, consist of small, greenish-brown flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex akanensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
