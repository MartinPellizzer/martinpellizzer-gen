    "intro": "Crepidium longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, and it blooms during the spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
