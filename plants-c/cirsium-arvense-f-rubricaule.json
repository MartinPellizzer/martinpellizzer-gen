It is a perennial herb characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is native to Europe. Its reddish stems and bracts distinguish it from other thistle species. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
