It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant is native to the southeastern United States and often attaches itself to a variety of host plants, including grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity. The species is notable for its unique ecological role as a parasite in various plant communities."
