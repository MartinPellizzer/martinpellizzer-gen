    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy watercress, is a variant of the common watercress species. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its flowers are small, white or pale green, and arranged in a raceme, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The leaves and stems are edible, though they may have a peppery taste similar to other members of the watercress genus."
