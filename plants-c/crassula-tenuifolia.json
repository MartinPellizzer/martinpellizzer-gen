It features small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a striking blue-green color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Crassula tenuifolia is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
