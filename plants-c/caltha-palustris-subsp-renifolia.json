    "intro": "Caltha palustris subsp. renifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has alternate, broadly ovate to heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
