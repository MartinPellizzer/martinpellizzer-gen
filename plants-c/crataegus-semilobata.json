It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves with shallow lobes, and clusters of white or pinkish flowers in spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and open areas."
