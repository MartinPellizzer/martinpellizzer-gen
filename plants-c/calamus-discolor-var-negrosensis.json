    "intro": "Calamus discolor var. negrosensis, commonly known as the Negros calamus, is a member of the Arecaceae family, characterized by its tall, slender stems and pinnate leaves. It is native to the Philippines, particularly the island of Negros, where it thrives in humid, tropical lowland forests. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by the development of hard, fibrous fruits. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their aromatic properties and traditional medicinal uses. This variant is distinguished by its pale green to yellowish stem color, which sets it apart from other calamus species."
