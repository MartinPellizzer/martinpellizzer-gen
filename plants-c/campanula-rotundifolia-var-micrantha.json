    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia var. micrantha, commonly known as the lesser bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems that bear whorled leaves, which are typically round or slightly heart-shaped. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
