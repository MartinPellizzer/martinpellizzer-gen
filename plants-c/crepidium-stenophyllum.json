    "intro": "Crepidium stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers have a unique structure with elongated sepals and petals, typical of the Orchidaceae family. Crepidium stenophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialty gardens."
