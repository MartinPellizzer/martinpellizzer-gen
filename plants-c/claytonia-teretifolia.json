    "intro": "Claytonia teretifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf springbeauty, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features basal rosettes of oval, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, showy flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white or pink, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves and flowers are often covered in a powdery bloom, which helps to reflect light and reduce water loss."
