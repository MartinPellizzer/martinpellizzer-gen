    "intro": "Calathea cuneata, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a tropical species native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns and a velvety texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, rich soil to flourish. Its foliage exhibits a unique phenomenon called nyctinasty, where the leaves close at night and open in the morning. Calathea cuneata is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
