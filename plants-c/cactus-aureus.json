    "intro": "Cactus aureus, commonly known as the golden cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Cactus aureus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in low-maintenance gardens."
