    "intro": "Chrysocoma tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly chrysocoma, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white pubescent foliage, which gives it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
