    "intro": "Chrysosplenium hallaisanense, commonly known as the Hallaisan chrysosplenium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Korea. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded areas, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of silky hair, which helps protect it from excessive sunlight and moisture loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
