    "intro": "Carota, commonly known as the carrot, is a biennial plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, tapering root, which is the primary edible part, and its feathery, finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, which are typical of the carrot's genus, Daucus. Carrots are rich in beta-carotene, which gives them their orange color and provides health benefits. They thrive in well-drained soil and require full sunlight for optimal growth."
