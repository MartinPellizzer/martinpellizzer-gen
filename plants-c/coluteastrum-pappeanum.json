    "intro": "Coluteastrum pappeanum, commonly known as the African false pennywort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is fibrous and helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Coluteastrum pappeanum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
