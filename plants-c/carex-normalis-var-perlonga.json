    "intro": "Carex normalis var. perlonga, commonly known as the long-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically longer and more elongated compared to other sedges. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by triangular, three-sided seed capsules. It thrives in wet to moist soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
