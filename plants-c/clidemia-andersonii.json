    "intro": "Clidemia andersonii, commonly known as the Andes mallow, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
