    "intro": "Collomiastrum, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae, which is characterized by hairy stems and showy flowers. The plants typically have compact, upright growth habits and produce blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Collomiastrum species are adapted to arid environments, featuring small, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. These plants are often found in rocky soils and play a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems."
