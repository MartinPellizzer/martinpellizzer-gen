    "intro": "Cocos arikuryroba, commonly known as the Brazilian coconut, is a rare and unique species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small, palm-like tree that produces a distinctive fruit with a thick, fibrous husk and a sweet, creamy pulp. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil to flourish. Its botanical features include compound leaves and a robust root system adapted to rocky and nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts to preserve its genetic diversity."
