    "intro": "Ceratopetalorchis sanfordiana, commonly known as the Sanford's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring spurred petals and a specialized lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small, usually white or pale green, and bloom during the spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
