It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are somewhat woody and can become branched. Columnea labellosa is prized in horticulture for its vibrant blooms and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in shaded environments."
