    "intro": "Clematis ovata, commonly known as the ovalleaf clematis, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with ovate leaflets that are typically 5 to 9 in number. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its climbing habit and vigorous growth make it suitable for trellises or as a garden cover. The fruit is a spherical follicle that splits open to release seeds."
