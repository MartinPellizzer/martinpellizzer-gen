    "intro": "Chamaebatiaria creedensis, commonly known as the Creede's mountain-mint, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, hairy foliage and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a strong, minty scent when crushed, while its flowers bloom in late summer. Chamaebatiaria creedensis plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat."
