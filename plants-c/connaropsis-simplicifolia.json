    "intro": "Connaropsis simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaved connar, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
