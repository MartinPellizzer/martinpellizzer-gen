    "intro": "Carex oederi f. pinguis, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedgeland sedge, is a variant of the Carex oederi species, characterized by its wide, flat leaves. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats."
