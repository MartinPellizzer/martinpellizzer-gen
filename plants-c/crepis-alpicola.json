    "intro": "Crepis alpicola, commonly known as the alpine hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cold and sunny conditions. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The small yellow flowers appear in spring, followed by seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal."
