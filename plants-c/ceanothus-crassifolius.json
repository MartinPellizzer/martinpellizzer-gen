    "intro": "Ceanothus crassifolius, commonly known as the thickleaf ceanothus, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage with thick, leathery leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant blue or violet flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
