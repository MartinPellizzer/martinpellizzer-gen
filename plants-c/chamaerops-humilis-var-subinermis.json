It is a small, slow-growing palm with a slender trunk and a crown of narrow, feather-like leaves. The leaves are typically shorter and more rigid compared to the broader leaves of the typical date palm. It produces small, clustered flowers that develop into edible dates, though the fruit is less prominent than in other varieties. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a landscape plant."
