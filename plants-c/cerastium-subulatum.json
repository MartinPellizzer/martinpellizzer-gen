    "intro": "Cerastium subulatum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover."
