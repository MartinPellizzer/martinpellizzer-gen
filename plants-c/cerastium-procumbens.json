    "intro": "Cerastium procumbens, commonly known as creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically heart-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it an effective ground cover plant."
