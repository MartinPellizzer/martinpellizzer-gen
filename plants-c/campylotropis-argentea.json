    "intro": "Campylotropis argentea, commonly known as silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, open woodlands, and along roadsides. Campylotropis argentea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in ecological restoration efforts."
