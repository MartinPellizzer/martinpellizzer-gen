It is characterized by its trailing stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to arid environments. The plant produces distinctive flowers with a unique structure, featuring a tubular corolla and specialized nectar glands. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
