    "intro": "Calamagrostis rigida, commonly known as stiff reed grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and marshy areas. Calamagrostis rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for wildlife and stabilizing soil in wet environments."
