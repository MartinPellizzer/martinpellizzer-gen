    "intro": "Chloris pycnothrix, commonly known as the dense-haired grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-green coloration. Chloris pycnothrix is often used in native landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
