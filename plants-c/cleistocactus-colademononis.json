    "intro": "Cleistocactus colademononis, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom at night, a unique adaptation to its desert environment. Its flowers are typically surrounded by a cluster of small, star-shaped leaves, giving it its common name. Due to its striking appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in dry, well-drained soils."
