    "intro": "Cycas fugax, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the eastern rainforests of Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves and a stout, unbranched trunk that develops a thick, fibrous outer layer over time. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Cycas fugax is a slow-growing species that thrives in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
