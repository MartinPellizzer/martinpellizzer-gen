    "intro": "Canna nepalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan canna, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and northern India. It features large, showy leaves that are typically bright green and lance-shaped, often reaching up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of striking, orange-red flowers with three petals and three sepals, which bloom during the summer months. Canna nepalensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a member of the Cannaceae family, which is characterized by its unique floral structure and adaptability to diverse environmental conditions."
