    "intro": "Calicotome hispanica, commonly known as Spanish broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Calicotome hispanica is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardy nature."
