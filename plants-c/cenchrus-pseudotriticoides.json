    "intro": "Cenchrus pseudotriticoides, commonly known as false wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats. Cenchrus pseudotriticoides is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
