    "intro": "Cerastium papuanum subsp. geminiflorum, commonly known as the Papuan mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Papua, Indonesia. It features small, basal rosettes of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers during the cooler months, typically from spring to early summer. Its flowers are arranged in dense, glandular inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and alpine soils, showcasing its resilience in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
