    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 rossianum, commonly known as the Ross's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
