    "intro": "Cnicus salinus, commonly known as the saltbush, is a flowering plant native to coastal and saline environments. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant thrives in salty soils and is often found in dunes and coastal regions. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important species in stabilizing sandy shores. Cnicus salinus plays a role in preventing erosion and supporting local biodiversity in harsh coastal habitats."
