    "intro": "Crinum palustre, commonly known as swamp lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas of the southeastern United States. It features strap-like, aromatic leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or orange. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Crinum palustre is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
