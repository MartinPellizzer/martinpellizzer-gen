    "intro": "Chamaecistus, commonly known as desert tobacco, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their low-growing, succulent stems and small, often fuzzy leaves. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. Chamaecistus species are adapted to harsh, dry environments and are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples."
