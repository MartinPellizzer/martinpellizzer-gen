    "intro": "Crystallopollen mbalense, commonly known as the African star orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that resemble celestial bodies. The plant has a complex structure with a short rhizome and dense, fibrous roots that help it survive in its humid, forested habitat. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns, and they bloom during the rainy season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
