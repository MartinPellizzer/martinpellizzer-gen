    "intro": "Commiphora africana var. togoensis, commonly known as African myrrh, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to western Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, resinous sap, which has been traditionally used in medicinal and ritualistic practices. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in tropical rainforests and is known for its lance-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural propagation in the wild."
