    "intro": "Carex intermedia f. permixta, commonly known as the mixed sedge, is a variant of the intermediate sedge native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. Its leaves are generally narrow and grassy, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in late spring to early summer. This form is notable for its hybrid characteristics, resulting in a mix of morphological traits from its parent species."
