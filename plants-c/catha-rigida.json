    "intro": "Catha rigida, commonly known as African coffee, is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is a shrub that can grow up to 2 meters tall, featuring woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by small, three-lobed fruits containing seeds. Its leaves contain cathinone and cathine, which are stimulant compounds responsible for its traditional use. Catha rigida is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
