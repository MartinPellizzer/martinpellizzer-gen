    "intro": "Chenopodiastrum simplex, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, branching stalks. Its root system is shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from loose, sandy soils. Chenopodiastrum simplex is often found in disturbed areas and can serve as a food source for various insects and small animals."
