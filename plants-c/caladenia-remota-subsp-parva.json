    "intro": "Caladenia remota subsp. parva, commonly known as the small ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils within open habitats, often in areas with low rainfall. Its flowers are usually less than 2 cm in diameter, with intricate petal structures that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
