    "intro": "Corydalis changuensis, commonly known as the Changuensis Larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds enclosed in a capsule, which is a common reproductive strategy among members of its family. Corydalis changuensis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
