    "intro": "Cistus villosus subsp. creticus, commonly known as the Cretan rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in Greece and Turkey. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy foliage and produces showy, pink or red flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local insect populations."
