    "intro": "Carex infirma, commonly known as slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Carex infirma is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
