    "intro": "Centaurea arrigonii, commonly known as the Armenian star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and bright yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid and semi-arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Asteraceae family."
