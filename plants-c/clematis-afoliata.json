    "intro": "Clematis afoliata, commonly known as the leafless clematis, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its lack of true leaves, with only small, scale-like structures present at the base of the stems. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are covered in fine, silky hairs, and it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Clematis afoliata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
