    "intro": "Cuscuta californica var. longiloba, commonly known as the longstem dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, white to yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that twine around its host. The plant is native to California and thrives in dry, disturbed habitats. It is often found parasitizing grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its rapid growth and lack of roots make it a unique and sometimes invasive species in its ecosystem."
