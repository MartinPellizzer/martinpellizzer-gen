    "intro": "Cardiochlaena menyanthidis, commonly known as the water plantain, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water. Cardiochlaena menyanthidis plays an important role in stabilizing aquatic soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
