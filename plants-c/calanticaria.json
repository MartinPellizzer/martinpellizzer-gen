    "intro": "Calanticaria, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, wind-dispersed seed stalk called a pappus. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. Calanticaria is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. It is often considered a weed but also has medicinal and culinary uses."
