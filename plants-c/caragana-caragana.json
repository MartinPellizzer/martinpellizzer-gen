    "intro": "Caragana caragana, commonly known as the Siberian peashrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold climates of northern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of leaflets, and its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Caragana caragana is often found in dry, sandy soils and is well-suited to harsh, arid environments. It is also valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in reclamation projects."
