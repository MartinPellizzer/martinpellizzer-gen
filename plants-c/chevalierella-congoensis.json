    "intro": "Chevalierella congoensis, commonly known as the Congo sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
