It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color. It is often found in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and swampy areas. Its growth habit and morphology make it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
