    "intro": "Cyclobothra obispoensis, commonly known as the Obispo's cycad, is a rare and unique cycad species native to southern California. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like foliage and a stout, unbranched stem. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and dry summers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
