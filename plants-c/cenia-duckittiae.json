    "intro": "Cenia duckittiae, commonly known as the Duckitt's cenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cenia duckittiae is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
