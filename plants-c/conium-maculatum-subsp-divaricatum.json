    "intro": "Conium maculatum subsp. divaricatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hemlock, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a highly toxic alkaloid called coniine, which makes it poisonous to both humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Due to its toxicity, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and horticultural settings."
