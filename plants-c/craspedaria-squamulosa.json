    "intro": "Craspedaria squamulosa, commonly known as the squamulose craspeda, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or boggy habitats. It is a perennial species that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
