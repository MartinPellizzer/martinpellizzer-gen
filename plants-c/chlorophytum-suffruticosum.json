It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with distinct yellow or white markings. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. It produces small, white flowers on slender stalks during the growing season. The plant's rosette structure helps it store water, contributing to its resilience in arid environments."
