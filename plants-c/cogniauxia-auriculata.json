    "intro": "Cogniauxia auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a dark green to blackish upper surface with a distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes. The thallus is leathery and often has a granular texture, while the lower surface contains numerous lirellae. It is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. This lichen is an important indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
