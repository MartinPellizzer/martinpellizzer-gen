    "intro": "Carex inversa var. perigynium, commonly known as the inverted sedge, is a variant of the Carex genus characterized by its unique floral structure. This plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its inflorescence features a distinctive arrangement of male and female flowers, with the female flowers positioned below the male ones, a trait that gives it its scientific name. The leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It is a perennial plant that plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms."
