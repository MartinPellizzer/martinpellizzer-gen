    "intro": "Cheilanthes \u00d7 fraser-jenkinsii, commonly known as the hybrid rock fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cheilanthes lanuginosa and Cheilanthes tomentosa. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, showcasing a preference for arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form with dense, hairy fronds that help reduce water loss. Its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Polypodiaceae family. This hybrid is often found in regions with limestone or shale substrates, where it thrives in low-nutrient conditions."
