    "intro": "Clerodendrum speciosum, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a flowering shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, surrounded by the showy bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its vibrant foliage and unique inflorescences. Clerodendrum speciosum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
