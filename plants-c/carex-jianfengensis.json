It is native to China, specifically the island of Hainan, where it grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant has grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters. It is characterized by its dense, rhizomatous growth habit and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.
