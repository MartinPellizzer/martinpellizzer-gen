    "intro": "Cheiropsis, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. These plants are characterized by their succulent leaves and showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Cheiropsis species are typically low-growing shrubs or herbs, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. They have a deep root system that allows them to access water from deeper soil layers. The flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to their ecological importance in desert ecosystems."
