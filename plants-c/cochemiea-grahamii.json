    "intro": "Cochemiea grahamii, commonly known as the Graham's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, cylindrical plant with multiple stems that branch out to form a dense, shrub-like structure. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and having a shallow root system. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
