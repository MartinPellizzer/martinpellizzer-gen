    "intro": "Chascanum rariflorum, commonly known as the rare-flower chascanum, is a perennial plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive central disk surrounded by ray florets. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
