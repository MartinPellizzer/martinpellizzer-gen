    "intro": "Calliandra patrisii, commonly known as the red calliandra, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like inflorescences that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy blooms and ability to thrive in warm, sunny climates. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, and the plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. Calliandra patrisii is also used in some regions for fodder and as a source of natural dyes."
