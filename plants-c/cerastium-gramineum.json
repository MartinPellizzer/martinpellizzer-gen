    "intro": "Cerastium gramineum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Cerastium gramineum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
