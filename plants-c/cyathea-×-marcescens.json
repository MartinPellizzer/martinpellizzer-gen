    "intro": "Cyathea \u00d7 marcescens, commonly known as the hybrid tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a tall, robust fern that can grow up to several meters in height, characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, with the trunk developing a fibrous, bark-like covering as it matures. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Cyathea \u00d7 marcescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
