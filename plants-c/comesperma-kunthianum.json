    "intro": "Comesperma kunthianum, commonly known as the desert honeysuckle, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Comesperma kunthianum is well adapted to xeric conditions and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats."
