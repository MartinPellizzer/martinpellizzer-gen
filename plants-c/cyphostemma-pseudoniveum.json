    "intro": "Cyphostemma pseudoniveum, commonly known as the white milk vine, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by yellow, berry-like fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
