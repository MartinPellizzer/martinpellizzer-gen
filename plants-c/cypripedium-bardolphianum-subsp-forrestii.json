    "intro": "Cypripedium bardolphianum subsp. forrestii, commonly known as the Forest's\u6753\u5170, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive lip that is often pale pink or white with a yellowish base. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces a single or few flowers per stem during the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species, making it a subject of conservation interest."
