    "intro": "Corynella immarginata, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in southeastern Australia. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of host trees. Corynella immarginata plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and other animals."
