    "intro": "Catapodium marinum, commonly known as sea blite, is a halophyte plant adapted to coastal environments. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces edible seeds that are used in some traditional cuisines. Catapodium marinum plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing soil erosion."
