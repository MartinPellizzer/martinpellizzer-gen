    "intro": "Cheirolepis kotschyi subsp. persica, commonly known as Persian cheirolepis, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Iran and Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, fleshy, red fruits. It is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in arid gardens."
