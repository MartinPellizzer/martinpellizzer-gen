    "intro": "Carex arenaria f. pallida, commonly known as the pale sand sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically pale green to silver in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions."
