    "intro": "Ceropegia gypsophila, commonly known as the rock ceropegia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tubular, pinkish-white flowers that are adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
