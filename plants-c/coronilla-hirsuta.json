    "intro": "Coronilla hirsuta, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Coronilla hirsuta is often used in agriculture as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities and its role in improving soil fertility."
