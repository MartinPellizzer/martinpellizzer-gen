    "intro": "Cochlearia renifolia, commonly known as the kidneyleaf scabious, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles and parts of northern Europe. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters, featuring hairy, kidney-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers arranged in a compact cluster, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal areas or on rocky slopes. Cochlearia renifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
