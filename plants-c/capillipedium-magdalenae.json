    "intro": "Capillipedium magdalenae, commonly known as the Magdalena's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its intricate, delicate flowers that typically feature a combination of white, green, and purple hues. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in the humid, shaded environments of its habitat. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to reduce water loss in the understory of dense forests. Capillipedium magdalenae is a subject of interest for botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
