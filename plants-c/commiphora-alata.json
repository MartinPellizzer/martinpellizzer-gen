    "intro": "Commiphora alata, commonly known as the African frankincense tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap, which has been used traditionally for medicinal and incense purposes. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, leathery leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters, while its fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature. The plant's botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and contribute to its ecological significance in its native regions."
