    "intro": "Cheilanthes lendigera, commonly known as the rock fern or slender rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and rocky environments in the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and its ability to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spore-bearing fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to conserve moisture in harsh conditions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, protective layer of moss-like tissue, which helps it survive in extreme climates. Cheilanthes lendigera is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that is well adapted to limestone and granite substrates."
