    "intro": "Cyathea boivinii var. hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, providing structural support and enabling it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The fronds are bioluminescent, a unique feature that helps in attracting pollinators and deterring herbivores."
