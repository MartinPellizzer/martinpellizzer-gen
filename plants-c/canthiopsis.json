    "intro": "Canthiopsis, commonly known as the violet bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are characterized by their bell-shaped flowers, which often display a range of colors from blue to purple. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Canthiopsis species are perennial herbs with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are often tubular at the base and may have a prominent spur, which is a feature common in many members of the Campanulaceae family."
