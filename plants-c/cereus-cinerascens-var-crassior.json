    "intro": "Cereus cinerascens var. crassior, commonly known as the thick-stemmed night bloomer, is a cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. Its growth habit is generally solitary, with a short, stout stem and few branches. It requires minimal water and full sun, making it a popular choice for desert gardens."
