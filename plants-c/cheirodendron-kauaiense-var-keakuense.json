    "intro": "Cheirodendron kauaiense var. keakuense, commonly known as the Kauai hibiscus, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks. It has simple, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, this species is critically endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts."
