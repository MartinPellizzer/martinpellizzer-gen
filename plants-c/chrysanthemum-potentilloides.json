    "intro": "Chrysanthemum potentilloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chrysanthemum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow to white, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its limited availability."
