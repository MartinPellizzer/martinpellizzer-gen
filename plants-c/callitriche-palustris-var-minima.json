    "intro": "Callitriche palustris var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to wetlands and slow-moving freshwater habitats. It typically grows in shallow water, often forming dense mats on the surface or submerged vegetation. The plant has small, floating or submersed leaves that are opposite and lance-shaped, with a smooth margin. It produces tiny, white flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. This variant is characterized by its smaller size compared to the typical form of Callitriche palustris, making it well adapted to limited space in aquatic environments."
