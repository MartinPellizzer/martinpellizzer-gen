    "intro": "Ceroxylon peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian wax palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that form a dense, umbrella-like canopy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to high-altitude environments and can thrive in cooler, moist conditions. The Peruvian wax palm is also valued for its ornamental beauty and has cultural significance in some regions."
