    "intro": "Colobachne pontica, commonly known as the Pontic grass, is a perennial grass species native to southeastern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and riverbanks.
