    "intro": "Celosia elegantissima, commonly known as the flame flower or crown of thorns, is a tropical flowering plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant thrives in warm, sunny conditions and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners in tropical and subtropical climates. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers inside the bracts, which are often overlooked in favor of the showy foliage. Celosia elegantissima is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, adding to its resilience and adaptability."
