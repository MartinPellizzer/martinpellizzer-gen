It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves, which are arranged in a unique radial pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within montane forests. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
