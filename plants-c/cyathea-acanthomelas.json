It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, hairy layer. The plant produces large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Its rhizome system allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Cyathea acanthomelas is valued for its ornamental appearance and has been cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant."
