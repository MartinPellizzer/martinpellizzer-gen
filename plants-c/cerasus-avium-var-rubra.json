    "intro": "Cerasus avium var. rubra, commonly known as the red cherry, is a variant of the sweet cherry tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, bright red fruits that are typically smaller than the standard sweet cherries. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by the fruiting season in late summer. Its leaves are elliptical with a slightly serrated edge, and the tree has a compact, rounded growth habit. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for both its flowers and edible fruits."
