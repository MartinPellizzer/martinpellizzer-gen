    "intro": "Corispermum krylovii, commonly known as the Krylov's bladderwrack, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in saline or brackish environments, such as coastal areas and salt marshes. The plant has fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, with inconspicuous petals, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to harsh, coastal conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in saline habitats."
