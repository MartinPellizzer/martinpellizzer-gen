    "intro": "Courimari guianensis, commonly known as the Guianese courimari, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed species. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can be harmful if ingested. This species is often found in humid forests and is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its applications are limited due to its toxicity."
