    "intro": "Crataegus sordida, commonly known as the gloomy hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, simple oval leaves, and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus sordida thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and scrublands. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in botanical studies."
