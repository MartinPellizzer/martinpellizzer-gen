    "intro": "Cactus polycentrus, commonly known as the golden cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in clusters of spiny, greenish-yellow bracts. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and moths. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
