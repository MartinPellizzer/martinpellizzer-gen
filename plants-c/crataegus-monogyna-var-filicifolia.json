    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. filicifolia, commonly known as the common hawthorn or simply hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are edible but typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important component of many ecosystems and a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
