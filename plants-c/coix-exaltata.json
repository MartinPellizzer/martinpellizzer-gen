    "intro": "Coix exaltata, commonly known as the Chinese sedge, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne in dense clusters. Coix exaltata is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its seeds are edible and have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits."
