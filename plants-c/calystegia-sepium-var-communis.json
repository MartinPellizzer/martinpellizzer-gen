    "intro": "Calystegia sepium var. communis, commonly known as field bindweed, is a perennial vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces fibrous, tuberous roots that allow it to persist through harsh conditions and regrow vigorously. It is often considered an invasive species in North America due to its rapid spread and tenacious growth habits. Botanically, it belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is known for its ability to climb and entangle other plants."
