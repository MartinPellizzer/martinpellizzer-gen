    "intro": "Crepidium latisegmentum, commonly known as the broad-segmented orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in the soil while absorbing nutrients. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
