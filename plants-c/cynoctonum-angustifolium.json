    "intro": "Cynoctonum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are narrow and elongated, typically reaching several meters in length, and are arranged in a rosette pattern. This plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones developing on separate plants. It is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appearance and historical significance in botanical studies."
