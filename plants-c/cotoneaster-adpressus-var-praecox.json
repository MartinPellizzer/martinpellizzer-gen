It features small, oval leaves that are typically gray-green in color and turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that persist into winter. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for use as a hedge or in rock gardens."
