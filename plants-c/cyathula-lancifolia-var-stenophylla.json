    "intro": "Cyathula lancifolia var. stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf spurge, is a variant of the spurge genus characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. It is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist or wetland habitats. The plant features small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, which are specialized cup-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually arranged oppositely along the stem and may have a waxy coating. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain environments."
