    "intro": "Crepidorhopalon tanzanicus, commonly known as the Tanzanian starling plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tanzania. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. It is primarily found in montane grasslands and is considered an indicator species of high-altitude ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
