    "intro": "Cissus martiniana, commonly known as the snow vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white powder, giving it a snow-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain tiny seeds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cissus martiniana is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique foliage and easy care requirements."
