    "intro": "Centrosema ferrugineum, commonly known as hairy poinsettia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking red bracts that surround small, yellow flowers, which are often mistaken for petals. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are hairy and have a reddish tinge."
