    "intro": "Cypripedium makasin, commonly known as the Makasin lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a specialized structure used to trap pollinators. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white with intricate patterns. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild."
