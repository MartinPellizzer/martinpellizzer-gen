    "intro": "Cevallia, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Convolvulaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Cevallia species are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. They typically grow as shrubs or subshrubs, with woody stems and small, elliptical leaves. The genus includes several species, such as Cevallia lanata and Cevallia corymbosa, which are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments."
