    "intro": "Crotalaria arborescens, commonly known as the tree crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a perennial shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its thick, woody stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers in racemes, which are followed by distinctive pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry forests. Crotalaria arborescens is also known for its allelopathic properties, which can inhibit the growth of nearby plants."
