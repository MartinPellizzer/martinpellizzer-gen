It is native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a dark blue drupe, containing a single seed, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
