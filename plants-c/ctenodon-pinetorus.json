    "intro": "Ctenodon pinetorus, commonly known as the Florida pineapple weed, is a small, annual herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a cluster of small flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and pine flatwoods. Ctenodon pinetorus is known for its ability to spread rapidly through seed dispersal by wind and animals."
