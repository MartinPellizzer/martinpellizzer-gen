    "intro": "Calamagrostis aequata, commonly known as the eastern calamagrostis, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue. The plant produces feathery, plume-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens and natural landscapes. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Calamagrostis aequata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
