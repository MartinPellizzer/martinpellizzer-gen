    "intro": "Corallorhiza williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' coralroot, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, making it a non-photosynthetic plant. It relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for its nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship that allows it to thrive in shaded, forested environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color, adding a subtle ornamental value to its habitat. It is native to the eastern United States and is often found in moist, acidic soils within hardwood forests. Due to its specialized requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
