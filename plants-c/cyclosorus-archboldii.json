    "intro": "Cyclosorus archboldii, commonly known as the Archbold's cyclosorus, is a rare fern native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often divided into intricate, overlapping segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
