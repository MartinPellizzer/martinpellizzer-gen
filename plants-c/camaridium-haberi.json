    "intro": "Camaridium haberi, commonly known as the Haber's camaridium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Camaridium genus, which is part of the Bromeliaceae family, known for its diverse and often strikingly colorful species. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it has strap-like leaves that form a rosette pattern. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Camaridium haberi is considered a conservation concern."
