    "intro": "Cirsium vulgare subsp. silvaticum, commonly known as the woodland thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant features large, spiny, purple to pinkish flower heads surrounded by broad, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early autumn, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
