    "intro": "Colpodium schelkownikowii, commonly known as the Schelkunov's colpodium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in early summer, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
