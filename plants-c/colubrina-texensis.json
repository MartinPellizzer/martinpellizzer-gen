    "intro": "Colubrina texensis, commonly known as Texas holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern United States. It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for native landscaping."
