    "intro": "Chrysanthemum maritimum, commonly known as sea daisy, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers and hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines, where it is adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. Its flowers bloom from late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Chrysanthemum maritimum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
