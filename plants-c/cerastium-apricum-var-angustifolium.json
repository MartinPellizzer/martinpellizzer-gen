    "intro": "Cerastium apricum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy, oval leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in temperate regions where it contributes to the ground cover vegetation."
