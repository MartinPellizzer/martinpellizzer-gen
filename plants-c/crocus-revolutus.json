    "intro": "Crocus revolutus, commonly known as the purple crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces striking violet or purple flowers with a distinctive, recurved petal structure. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves emerge, making it one of the first flowers to appear in gardens. Its bulbs are adapted to store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and borders."
