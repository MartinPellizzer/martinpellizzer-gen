    "intro": "Carpinus pubescens var. bigiehensis, commonly known as the Bigiehena hornbeam, is a rare variant of the hornbeam genus native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are densely covered with short, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by small, persistent fruits that are typically 3-lobed. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
