    "intro": "Cotyledon coruscans, commonly known as the glittering cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange during the growing season. Its leaves can change color in response to light, displaying vibrant hues of red, orange, and yellow. Cotyledon coruscans is well-suited for rock gardens or dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
