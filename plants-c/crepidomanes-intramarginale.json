It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Crepidomanes intramarginale thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems."
