    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum var. caespitosum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming clusters of small, spoon-shaped leaves that are hairy and often covered in fine white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early spring, which are typically arranged in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and streambanks. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in gardens and disturbed soils."
