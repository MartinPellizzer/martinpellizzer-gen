    "intro": "Coelachne monantha, commonly known as the single-flowered coelachne, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. Its flowers are usually pale green to reddish in color, and it produces small, hard grains as its seeds. Coelachne monantha is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
