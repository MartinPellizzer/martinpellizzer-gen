    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris subf. densa, commonly known as the dense heather, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the western regions of the United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white, typically in late summer to early autumn. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and remain on the plant year-round, providing a lush appearance throughout the seasons. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for garden landscapes and naturalized plantings."
