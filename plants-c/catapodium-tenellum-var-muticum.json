    "intro": "Catapodium tenellum var. muticum, commonly known as the small catapodium or narrowleaf catapodium, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, pale green or brown spikelets that are clustered at the ends of the stems. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and gravelly fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant in arid or drought-prone gardens."
