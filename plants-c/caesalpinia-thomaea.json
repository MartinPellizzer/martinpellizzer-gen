    "intro": "Caesalpinia thomaea, commonly known as the flame acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and distinctive yellow-orange flowers that bloom in dense, racemose inflorescences. The plant produces elongated, woody pods that contain several flattened, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Caesalpinia thomaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
