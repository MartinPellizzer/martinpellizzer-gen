    "intro": "Cirsium peraffine, commonly known as the rough thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and wastelands. Its leaves are covered in stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
