    "intro": "Cissus lenticellata, commonly known as the sand dollar plant, is a member of the Vitaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a climbing or trailing plant characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits resembling sand dollars, which give it its common name. Its stems are often covered with small, raised bumps called lenticels, which aid in gas exchange. Cissus lenticellata is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
