It features tall, slender stems with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically reddish-purple in color, especially when young. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor firmly in well-drained soil. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot.
