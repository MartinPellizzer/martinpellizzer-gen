    "intro": "Clinopodium nanum, commonly known as dwarf mint or small wood mint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters and features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a minty aroma. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Clinopodium nanum is often used in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and calming properties."
