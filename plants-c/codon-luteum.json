    "intro": "Codon luteum, commonly known as the yellow codon, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Codon luteum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
