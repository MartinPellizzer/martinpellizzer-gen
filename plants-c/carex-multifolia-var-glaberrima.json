It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
