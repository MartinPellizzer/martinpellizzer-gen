It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
