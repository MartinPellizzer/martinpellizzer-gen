    "intro": "Cerastium holosteoides subsp. serpentini, commonly known as the serpent's tail chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local insect populations."
