    "intro": "Carex omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to China, specifically the Sichuan province, where it grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and streamside areas. The plant is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, sword-shaped leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that are typically green or brown in color. Carex omeiensis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
