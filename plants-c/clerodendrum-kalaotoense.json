It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that consist of clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds.
