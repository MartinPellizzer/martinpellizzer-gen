It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features palmately divided leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. Its most valuable part is the underground rhizome, which contains the alkaloid berberine. This alkaloid has been used in traditional medicine for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties."
