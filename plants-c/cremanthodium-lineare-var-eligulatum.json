It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and typical sunflower-like structure. The plant features linear, often hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a raceme. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
