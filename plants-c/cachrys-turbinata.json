    "intro": "Cachrys turbinata, commonly known as the turbinated corymbia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, turbinated (towering) inflorescences. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its bark is smooth and peels in thin layers. Cachrys turbinata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
