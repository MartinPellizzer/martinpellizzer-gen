    "intro": "Collaea formosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It has a distinctive dark green to blackish upper surface with a velvety texture, while its lower surface is pale and covered in tiny, white, branched structures called rhizines. The thallus is composed of a complex network of fungal hyphae and algal cells, which work together to absorb nutrients and water. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health."
