    "intro": "Carex nivalis f. griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's snow sedge, is a perennial sedge native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming low, mat-like colonies. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with white or pale green bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
