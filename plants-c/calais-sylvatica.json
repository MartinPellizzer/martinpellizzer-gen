It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender stems. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Calais sylvatica is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
