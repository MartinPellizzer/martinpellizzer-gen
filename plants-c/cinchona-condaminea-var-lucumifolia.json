    "intro": "Cinchona condaminea var. lucumifolia, commonly known as the Peruvian bark or quina, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Peru and Ecuador, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It is closely related to other cinchona species, many of which are sources of quinine, used historically in the treatment of malaria. Due to its medicinal properties and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and protected areas."
