    "intro": "Cyanus tuberosus, commonly known as the Mexican sunflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its bright orange to red ray florets and yellow disk florets, which give it a striking appearance. The plant is an annual or biennial herb that grows up to 2 meters tall, with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. It produces tuberous roots that store nutrients, aiding in its survival during dry periods. Cyanus tuberosus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
