    "intro": "Cynometra spruceana var. procera, commonly known as the giant ironwood tree, is a tall, evergreen species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark-green foliage and robust, woody trunk, which can reach heights of over 30 meters. The tree produces small, clustered white flowers followed by oval, woody pods containing flat, dark seeds. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a shade tree."
