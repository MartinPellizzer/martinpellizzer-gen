    "intro": "Centella dentata, commonly known as the toothed centella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in umbels. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in moist, shaded environments. Centella dentata is often found in wetlands, forest floors, and along stream banks where it thrives in humid conditions."
