    "intro": "Conyza lyrata var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy leaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and daisy-like yellow flowers with white ray florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and wetlands. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its spread. The hairy texture of its leaves and stems is a distinguishing botanical feature."
