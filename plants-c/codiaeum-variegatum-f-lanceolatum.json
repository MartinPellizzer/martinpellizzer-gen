    "intro": "Codiaeum variegatum f. lanceolatum, commonly known as the flame vine or croton, is a strikingly colorful foliage plant native to tropical regions. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves with vibrant, multicolored patterns of red, yellow, and green. The plant is known for its ornamental value, often cultivated for its striking leaf displays rather than its flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vivid coloration. Due to its sensitivity to cold, it is typically grown as a houseplant or in tropical climates."
