    "intro": "Castanea spectabilis, commonly known as the showy chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves and distinctive, spiny burrs that enclose its edible nuts. The tree produces showy yellow-green flowers in spring, followed by orange to red foliage in autumn. Its nuts are encased in thick, woody husks and are an important food source for wildlife. The showy chestnut is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical significance in the region."
