    "intro": "Coelocline lucida, commonly known as the bright-eyed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. The orchid blooms during the wet season, producing fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
