    "intro": "Cytisus hirsutus f. major, commonly known as the greater hairy broom, is a variant of the common broom plant. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, thorny growth and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are small, oval, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its hirsute appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and sandy habitats. This form is notable for its more robust and showy floral display compared to the typical variety."
