    "intro": "Campanula glomerata subsp. caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It features upright stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
