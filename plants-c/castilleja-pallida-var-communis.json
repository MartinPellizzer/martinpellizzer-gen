It is native to the western United States and grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on host plants for nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and are clustered in dense inflorescences. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain insects."
