    "intro": "Chasmanthera dependens, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its pendulous, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. The flowers, which can be pink, white, or yellow, are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
