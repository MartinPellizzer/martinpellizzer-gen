    "intro": "Capurodendron microlobum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant native to the southeastern United States. It grows on the branches of hardwood trees such as oaks and hickories, forming dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, white berries that are dispersed by birds, facilitating its spread to new host trees. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, where it derives nutrients from the host's vascular system. The plant's botanical characteristics include a lack of true roots and a reliance on photosynthesis for some of its energy needs."
