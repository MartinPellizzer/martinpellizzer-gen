    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis glauca var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender Chinese ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, and it produces small, spiny fruits called cupules. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in mixed forests and along riverbanks. Due to its slow growth and durable wood, it is valued for both ecological and commercial purposes."
