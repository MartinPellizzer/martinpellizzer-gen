    "intro": "Cycnium herzfeldianum f. holstii, commonly known as the Holst's giant water hyacinth, is a variant of the water hyacinth species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that float on the water surface, and its striking purple-blue flowers that bloom above the water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats that can impact aquatic ecosystems. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a useful aquatic plant for water purification and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats. The f. holstii form is distinguished by its slightly larger size and more robust growth compared to the typical water hyacinth."
