    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that give it a distinctive cascading appearance, especially in the spring when it produces clusters of white flowers. The plant has small, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it produces red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The weeping hawthorn is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife and its historical use in traditional medicine."
