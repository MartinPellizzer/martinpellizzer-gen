    "intro": "Cymopterus panamintensis var. panamintensis, commonly known as the Panamint sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of North America. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, oval seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments with high temperatures. This variety is distinguished by its geographic range and specific morphological features compared to other Cymopterus species."
