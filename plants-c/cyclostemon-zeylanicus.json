    "intro": "Cyclostemon zeylanicus, commonly known as the Ceylon cycad, is a unique plant native to Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is adapted to tropical climates and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
