    "intro": "Chrysosplenium kiotense f. xanthandrum, commonly known as the golden-leaved chrysosplenium, is a rare and striking variant of the chrysosplenium genus. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow foliage, which contrasts sharply with its typically green leaves. This plant belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is native to specific regions in Japan. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in botanical gardens."
