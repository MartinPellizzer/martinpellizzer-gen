    "intro": "Comesperma ericinum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its aromatic foliage has been used traditionally by Indigenous communities for medicinal purposes."
