It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green to grayish in color. This plant is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in crevices, thriving in dry, sunny environments. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself securely in harsh conditions. The plant is notable for its ability to survive in arid regions with minimal water, making it a hardy and resilient species."
