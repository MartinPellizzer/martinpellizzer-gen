    "intro": "Capsella pastoralis, commonly known as mouse-ear or mouse-ear chickweed, is a small annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and has a low, sprawling growth habit. The plant features alternate, oval-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Capsella pastoralis is often found in temperate climates and is considered a common weed in agricultural settings."
