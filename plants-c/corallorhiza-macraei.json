    "intro": "Corallorhiza macraei, commonly known as the showy coralroot, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph. It relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrition, absorbing nutrients through its roots rather than photosynthesis. This species is typically found in moist, shaded forest habitats across the eastern United States. Its flowers are striking, with bright orange-red petals and a distinctive coral-like appearance. Due to its reliance on specific fungi and habitat conditions, it is considered a rare and sensitive plant species."
