    "intro": "Clowesia scurra, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Clowesia scurra is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping in desert landscapes."
