    "intro": "Chaetochloa costata, commonly known as the ribbed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often ribbed, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy surface. Small, spike-like inflorescences bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, which contribute to its role in riparian ecosystems."
