    "intro": "Chloris canterae var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, delicate blue or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value comes from its fine texture and color, though it is not typically used for forage. It is relatively low maintenance and resistant to drought once established."
