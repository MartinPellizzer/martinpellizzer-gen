    "intro": "Carmichaelia egmontiana, commonly known as the Egmont's flaxflower, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting native pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
