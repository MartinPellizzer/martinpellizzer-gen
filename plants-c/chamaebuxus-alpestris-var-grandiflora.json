    "intro": "Chamaebuxus alpestris var. grandiflora, commonly known as the Alpine bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and slightly waxy, adapted to harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense umbels. These flowers give way to bright red berries that are a food source for various birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high altitudes."
