    "intro": "Carex elata subsp. reuteriana, commonly known as the tall sedge, is a perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. This subspecies typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soil and support local biodiversity. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
