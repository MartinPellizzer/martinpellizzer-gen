    "intro": "Copernicia curtissii, commonly known as the golden cup palm, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. It is a small, ornamental palm with a distinctive, clustered growth habit and bright yellow, fan-shaped leaves. The plant is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions. The fruit of Copernicia curtissii produces a lightweight, buoyant seed that aids in its dispersal by water."
