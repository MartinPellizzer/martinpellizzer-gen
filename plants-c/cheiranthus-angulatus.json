    "intro": "Cheiranthus angulatus, commonly known as the angular whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its angular, elongated leaves are a distinguishing feature, and it produces seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds. Cheiranthus angulatus is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a hardy, resilient species."
