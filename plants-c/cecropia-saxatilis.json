    "intro": "Cecropia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and long, pendulous inflorescences that bear small, white flowers. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with ants, which reside in the hollow stems and protect the tree from herbivores. Its roots can form extensive networks, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions. Cecropia saxatilis is often found in disturbed habitats and plays a role in providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
