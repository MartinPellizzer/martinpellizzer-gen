    "intro": "Carex sellowiana var. prorepens, commonly known as the Sellow's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
