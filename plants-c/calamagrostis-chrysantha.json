It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with yellow or bronze. The plant produces fluffy, golden-brown seed heads in late summer, which add ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and marshy areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
