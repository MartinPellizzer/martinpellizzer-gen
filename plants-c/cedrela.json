    "intro": "Cedrela, commonly known as mahogany, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Meliaceae. It comprises several species, many of which are valued for their durable, high-quality timber. These trees are native to tropical regions of the Americas, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Cedrela species typically have compound leaves and produce small, yellowish flowers followed by winged fruits. They play an important role in both ecological systems and the timber industry."
