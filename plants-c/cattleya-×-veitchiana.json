    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 veitchiana, commonly known as the Veitch's Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in environments with seasonal droughts. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. This orchid is prized for its beauty and fragrance, making it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
