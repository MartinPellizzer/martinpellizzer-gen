    "intro": "Calceolaria sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-leaved slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude regions. Calceolaria sessiliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking blooms."
