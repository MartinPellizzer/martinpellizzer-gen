    "intro": "Calyptranthes pendula, commonly known as the hanging calyptranthes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
