    "intro": "Cynanchum peninsulare, commonly known as the Florida milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is part of the Asclepiadaceae family, known for its milkweed species, and is notable for its ecological importance to native pollinators. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
