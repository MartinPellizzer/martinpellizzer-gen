    "intro": "Cousinia aspera, commonly known as the rough cousin, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant is known for its gray-green, hairy leaves and showy purple or pink ray flowers. Cousinia aspera is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
