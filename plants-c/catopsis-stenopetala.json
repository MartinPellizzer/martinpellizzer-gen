It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a distinctive central vein. It is primarily distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
