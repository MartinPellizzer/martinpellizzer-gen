    "intro": "Calamagrostis laxa, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It features slender, arching stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with fine, silver-green leaves that have a soft, silky texture. The plant produces fluffy, pale pink to white plumes in late summer, which are highly ornamental and attract pollinators. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an effective plant for erosion control and wetland restoration."
