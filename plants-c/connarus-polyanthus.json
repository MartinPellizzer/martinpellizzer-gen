    "intro": "Connarus polyanthus, commonly known as the red-veined begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Begoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves with prominent red veins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom during the warmer months. Connarus polyanthus thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor cultivation and shaded garden settings."
