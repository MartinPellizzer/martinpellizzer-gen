It is characterized by its vivid red petals and sepals, which are often speckled with darker hues, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters, producing a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its unique beauty and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is considered a valuable species in horticultural collections."
