    "intro": "Castilleja ambigua var. insalutata, commonly known as the pallid paintbrush, is a flowering plant in the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for water and nutrients. The plant features bright orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and prairies, often associated with grasses and forbs. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, and it has a slender, branching stem that supports its showy inflorescence."
