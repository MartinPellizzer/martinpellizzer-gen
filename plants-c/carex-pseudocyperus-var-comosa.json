    "intro": "Carex pseudocyperus var. comosa, commonly known as the woolly sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically thrives in moist to wet soils, making it a common species in wetlands and marshy areas. Its ornamental value comes from its soft, fluffy appearance, which makes it popular in water gardens and naturalized landscapes."
