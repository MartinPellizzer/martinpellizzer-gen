    "intro": "Calyptropsidium ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman's ghostflower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is notable for its unique morphology, featuring a short, stocky stem and narrow, linear leaves. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the top of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calyptropsidium ekmanii is considered a critically endangered species."
