It is native to the island of New Caledonia, where it thrives in humid, tropical conditions. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk with a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. Its reproductive structures include male and female cones, typical of cycads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
