    "intro": "Curcuma pallida, commonly known as the pale turmeric, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers, which are often overlooked in favor of its medicinal rhizomes. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a smooth, waxy texture. The rhizomes, though less colorful than those of other curcuma species, contain curcuminoids and are used in traditional medicine and as a mild dye."
