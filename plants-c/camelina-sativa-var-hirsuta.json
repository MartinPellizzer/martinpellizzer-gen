It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other varieties. This plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and thrives in well-drained soils. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Hairy camelina is valued for its oil-rich seeds, which are used in both culinary and industrial applications."
