It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh-producing species. The plant is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and dark green, leathery leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and has a unique ability to exude a resinous sap, which has been used traditionally for its aromatic and medicinal properties. The plant thrives in dry, tropical climates and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
