    "intro": "Carex vulgaris var. subramosa, commonly known as the slender sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. This variety is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
