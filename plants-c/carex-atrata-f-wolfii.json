    "intro": "Carex atrata f. wolfii, commonly known as the wolfii form of the black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear brownish to black flowers. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
