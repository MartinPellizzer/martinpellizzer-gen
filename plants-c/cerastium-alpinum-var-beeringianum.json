It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates. It has a compact growth habit, often forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
