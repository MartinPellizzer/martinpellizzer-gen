    "intro": "Cirsium brevispinum, commonly known as the short-spined thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny stems. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually purple or pink, arranged in a dense, spherical cluster, and bloom from late summer to early autumn. Cirsium brevispinum is adapted to rocky and dry habitats, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
