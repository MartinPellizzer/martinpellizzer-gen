    "intro": "Coffea lancifolia var. auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate coffee plant, is a species native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) leaf bases. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds used for coffee production. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and coffee enthusiasts alike."
