    "intro": "Cheilanthes multifida var. flexa, commonly known as the flexed rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and rocky environments in North America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and deeply divided, pinnatifid leaves that give it a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on cliffs, rock faces, and in dry, sunny habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
