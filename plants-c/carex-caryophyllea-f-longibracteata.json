    "intro": "Carex caryophyllea f. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract sedge, is a variant of the broadleaf sedge native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and a compact growth habit. The plant produces spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its foliage and floral structure make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
