    "intro": "Cuscuta micrantha, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrition. It has small, yellowish stems covered in tiny, hairless tendrils that attach to host plants. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and capsules containing numerous seeds. It is often found in agricultural fields and gardens, where it can cause damage to crops. Its life cycle is short, with rapid growth and reproduction depending on suitable host plants."
