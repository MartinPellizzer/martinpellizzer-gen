    "intro": "Crepis albida subsp. asturica, commonly known as the Asturian white hawkweed, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy rosettes. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils in mountainous regions, often in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
