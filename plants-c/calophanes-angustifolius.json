    "intro": "Calophanes angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved calophanes, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
