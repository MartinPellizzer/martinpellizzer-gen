    "intro": "Carlina vulgaris var. glabrata, commonly known as the nakedhead cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are usually hairy, but the variety glabrata has reduced hair, giving it a smoother appearance. It produces yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn."
