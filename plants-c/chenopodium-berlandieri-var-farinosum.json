    "intro": "Chenopodium berlandieri var. farinosum, commonly known as pigweed, is a flowering plant in the amaranth family. It is native to North America and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant produces copious amounts of wind-pollinated flowers, which contribute to its rapid spread in disturbed soils. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found along roadsides and in agricultural fields. The species is also known for its edible leaves, which have been used in traditional diets and forage for livestock."
