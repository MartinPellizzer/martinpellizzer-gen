    "intro": "Cyclanthera elegans var. grandifolia, commonly known as the giant cucumber or large-leaf bitter gourd, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and long, slender, spiny fruits that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruits, though they are typically used in local cuisines. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural and ecological studies."
