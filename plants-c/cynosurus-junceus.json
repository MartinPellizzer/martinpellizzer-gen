    "intro": "Cynosurus junceus, commonly known as narrowleaf basketgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 millimeters wide, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with brown or reddish hues. Cynosurus junceus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
