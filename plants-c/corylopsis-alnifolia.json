It is characterized by its fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its habitat includes moist, acidic soils in woodlands and streambanks, and it is often found in association with alder trees. The plant is valued for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
