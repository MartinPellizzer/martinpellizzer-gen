    "intro": "Corydalis pseudorupestris, commonly known as the rock corydalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh, arid environments it inhabits. Corydalis pseudorupestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
