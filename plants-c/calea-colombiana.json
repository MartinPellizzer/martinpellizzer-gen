    "intro": "Calea colombiana, commonly known as the \"flower of the night,\" is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety, dark purple bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported sedative and calming properties. Calea colombiana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests."
