    "intro": "Cuscuta urticae, commonly known as dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It attaches itself to its host using specialized haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on weeds or other plants in disturbed soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas easily. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants, making it a significant weed in agricultural settings."
