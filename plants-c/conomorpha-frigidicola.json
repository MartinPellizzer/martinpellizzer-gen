    "intro": "Conomorpha frigidicola, commonly known as the cold-loving conomorpha, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to extreme cold environments. It belongs to the family Conomorphaceae and is characterized by its unique morphological features that enable survival in subarctic and alpine regions. The plant typically exhibits a low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, densely packed leaves. Its reproductive structures are highly modified, often appearing as clusters of tiny, frost-resistant flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Conomorpha frigidicola is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
