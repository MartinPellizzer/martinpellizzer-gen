    "intro": "Conringia, commonly known as bladder Campion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, pink or purple flowers and are often found in dry, rocky soils. Conringia species typically have hairy stems and leaves, and their flowers are arranged in racemes. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release the seeds. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional medicine."
