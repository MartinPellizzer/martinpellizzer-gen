    "intro": "Carex alascana, commonly known as the Alaska sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in tundra and alpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh conditions with limited nutrients. Carex alascana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native range."
