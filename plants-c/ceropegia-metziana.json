    "intro": "Ceropegia metziana, commonly known as the dwarf string of hearts, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, trailing stems with heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often pale green or white, which are pollinated by specific insects. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its compact growth habit, it is a popular choice for hanging baskets and indoor gardens."
