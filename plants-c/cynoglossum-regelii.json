    "intro": "Cynoglossum regelii, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, bell-shaped inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens with cooler climates."
