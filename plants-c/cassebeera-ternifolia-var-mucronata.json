    "intro": "Cassebeera ternifolia var. mucronata, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
