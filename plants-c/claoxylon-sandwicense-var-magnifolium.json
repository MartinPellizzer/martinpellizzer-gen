    "intro": "Claoxylon sandwicense var. magnifolium, commonly known as the Hawaiian fan-leaf tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, giving it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments on the island of Maui, where it thrives in the understory of native forests. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, producing edible fruits that are consumed by native birds and bats. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, this plant is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in Hawaii."
