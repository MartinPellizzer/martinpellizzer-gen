    "intro": "Chaetochloa rariflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy habitats in Australia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in dense mats, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
