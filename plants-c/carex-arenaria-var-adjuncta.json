    "intro": "Carex arenaria var. adjuncta, commonly known as the sand sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, which help it thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is often found in dunes, beaches, and other arid or semi-arid habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize sandy soils."
