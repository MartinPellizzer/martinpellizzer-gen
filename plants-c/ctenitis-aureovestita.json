    "intro": "Ctenitis aureovestita, commonly known as the golden-haired fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The fronds are covered in a dense layer of silky, golden-hair-like structures, which give the plant its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various small animals and insects."
