    "intro": "Cryptantha humilis var. ovina, commonly known as the woolly cryptantha, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a woolly appearance. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open areas such as disturbed sites or along roadsides. Its botanical structure supports its role as a nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
