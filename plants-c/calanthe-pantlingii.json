    "intro": "Calanthe pantlingii, commonly known as the Pantling's orchid, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen pseudobulbs and showy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Calanthe pantlingii thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
