    "intro": "Carduus euboicus, commonly known as the Euboean thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring a robust stem covered in coarse, prickly hairs. The plant produces large, spiny leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and composite, consisting of ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Carduus euboicus is characterized by its strong aromatic scent and is often found in dry, rocky soils."
