    "intro": "Cyathea palembanica, commonly known as the Palembang tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is a large, evergreen tree fern characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, tropical climates with high rainfall. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a dense network, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its fronds are often used in traditional crafts and as ornamental plants in gardens."
