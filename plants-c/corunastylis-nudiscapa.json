    "intro": "Corunastylis nudiscapa, commonly known as the naked-stemmed starwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae, which includes plants such as spiderworts and waterwheel plants. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often leafless, giving it its common name. Its small, star-shaped flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. Corunastylis nudiscapa is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with roots that help stabilize the soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats."
