    "intro": "Carex filicina var. ciliata, commonly known as the silky sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, typically arranged in a loose panicle. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its delicate, ciliate (fringed) leaves give it a distinctive appearance and contribute to its common name."
