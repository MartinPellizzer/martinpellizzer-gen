    "intro": "Ctenitis dolphinensis, commonly known as the dolphin's tail fern, is a unique species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that resemble the tail of a dolphin, giving it its common name. The plant has a robust, slender trunk that grows slowly over time, supporting the layered fronds that emerge from its crown. Its fronds are typically a deep green, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Ctenitis dolphinensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist gardens."
