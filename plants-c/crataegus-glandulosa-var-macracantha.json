    "intro": "Crataegus glandulosa var. macracantha, commonly known as the glandular hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its spiny branches, which provide protection from herbivores, and its clusters of white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges and a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
