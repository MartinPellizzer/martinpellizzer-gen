    "intro": "Colymbada podospermifolia, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
