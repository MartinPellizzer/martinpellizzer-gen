    "intro": "Carex stellulata subsp. radiata, commonly known as star sedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale to yellowish flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often used in wetland restoration projects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
