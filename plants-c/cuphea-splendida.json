    "intro": "Cuphea splendida, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red bracts that resemble flames, which are not petals but modified leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens in warm climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant foliage and unique floral display."
