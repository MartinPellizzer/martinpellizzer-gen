    "intro": "Cyrtandra chlamydocalyx, commonly known as the coral-tipped cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. Cyrtandra chlamydocalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
