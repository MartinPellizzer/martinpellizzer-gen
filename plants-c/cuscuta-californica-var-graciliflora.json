    "intro": "Cuscuta californica var. graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to California and thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread to new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or damage its host plants, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes problematic in agricultural settings."
