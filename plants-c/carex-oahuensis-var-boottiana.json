    "intro": "Carex oahuensis var. boottiana, commonly known as Oahu sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
