    "intro": "Cirsium heterophyllum var. incisum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a tall, spiny stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with deeply lobed, silvery-green leaves that have a distinctive narrow shape. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spherical shape known as a head. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Due to its prickly foliage, it is considered a potential weed in agricultural settings."
