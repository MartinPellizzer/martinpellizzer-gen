    "intro": "Calophanes hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's calophane, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and delicate, umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale yellow, are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calophanes hildebrandtii is considered a species of conservation concern."
