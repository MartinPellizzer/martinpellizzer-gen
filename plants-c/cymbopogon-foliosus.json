    "intro": "Cymbopogon foliosus, commonly known as the broadleaf grass or silver grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, elongated leaves with a silver-gray hue due to the dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its aromatic properties make it a potential candidate for essential oil extraction and ornamental use."
