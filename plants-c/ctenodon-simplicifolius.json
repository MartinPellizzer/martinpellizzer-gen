    "intro": "Ctenodon simplicifolius, commonly known as the simple-leaved ctenodon, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, often clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
