This plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. The flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring vibrant yellow petals with a striking red or orange center. Capnoides gigantea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense rainforest undergrowth. Its unique morphology and striking coloration make it a subject of interest for both botanists and horticulturists."
