    "intro": "Carex mckittrickensis, commonly known as Mckittrick sedge, is a rare grass-like plant native to the United States, specifically found in the southeastern region. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. Its botanical features include small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny flowers, and it plays a role in maintaining wetland ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
