    "intro": "Cyanea fissa, commonly known as the Hawaiian bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Cyanea fissa has lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and birds. It is an important component of Hawaii's unique flora and is considered rare due to habitat loss and invasive species."
