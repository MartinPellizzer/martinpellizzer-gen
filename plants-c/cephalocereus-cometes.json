    "intro": "Cephalocereus cometes, commonly known as the comet cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and dense clusters of white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry, well-drained soils. Its spines are typically short and cylindrical, providing protection from herbivores. The comet cactus is often cultivated for its striking appearance and ability to thrive in desert-like conditions."
