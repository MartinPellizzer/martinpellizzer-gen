It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabrescens is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability and legume-like seed pods."
