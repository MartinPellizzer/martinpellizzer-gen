    "intro": "Capsella rhombea, commonly known as the heartweed or roundleaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual herb characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically heart-shaped or rounded. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, which bloom from spring to summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. Capsella rhombea is often found in disturbed soils and can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
