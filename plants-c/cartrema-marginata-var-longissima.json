    "intro": "Cartrema marginata var. longissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in loose racemes. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, while its rhizomes allow for vegetative propagation. This variety is distinguished by its elongated inflorescence and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
