    "intro": "Crataegus saligna, commonly known as the silky crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched form and its clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, tart fruits that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have a slightly serrated margin. Crataegus saligna is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can be found in gardens and natural habitats across its native range."
