    "intro": "Croton horridulus, commonly known as the rough croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
