    "intro": "Cupressus tongmaiensis, commonly known as the Tongmaiensis cypress, is a rare and ancient conifer native to China. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant has scale-like leaves arranged in crossed pairs, typical of the Cupressaceae family. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
