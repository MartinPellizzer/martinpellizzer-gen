    "intro": "Calea camporum, commonly known as the \"flower of the night,\" is a striking plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night and close in the morning. The plant has a tall, upright stem with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its nocturnal blooming habit is triggered by changes in light and temperature. Calea camporum is also notable for its medicinal properties, used traditionally in folk remedies."
