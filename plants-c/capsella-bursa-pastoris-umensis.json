    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris umensis, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white flowers arranged in clusters and has hairy, alternate leaves that are often succulent. The plant produces small, round seed pods that burst open to disperse seeds, a mechanism known as explosive dehiscence. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along pathways. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed but also a subject of study in plant ecology and genetics."
