    "intro": "Cocos guineensis, commonly known as the African coconut tree, is a member of the Arecaceae family. It is a tall, slender tree that can grow up to 20 meters in height, with pinnate leaves and a smooth, greyish trunk. The plant produces large, fibrous fruits called coconuts, which contain a clear liquid known as coconut water. The outer husk of the fruit is thick and fibrous, while the inner part consists of a white, fleshy layer called the coconut meat. This plant is native to tropical regions of Africa and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil."
