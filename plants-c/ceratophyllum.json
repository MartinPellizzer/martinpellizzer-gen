    "intro": "Ceratophyllum, commonly known as hornwort, is a genus of aquatic plants characterized by its dense, branching structure and lack of true roots. It is found in freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes, where it provides habitat for aquatic life. The plant's leaves are feather-like and arranged in whorls, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Ceratophyllum species are often used in aquariums due to their ability to oxygenate water and support fish populations. Additionally, they play a role in water purification by absorbing nutrients and reducing algae growth."
