It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodland areas. Due to its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
