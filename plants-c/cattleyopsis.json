    "intro": "Cattleyopsis, commonly known as the \"miniature cattleya,\" is a genus of orchids native to Southeast Asia. These plants are characterized by their compact size and showy, fragrant flowers that often resemble those of their larger relatives. They typically grow as epiphytes, attaching themselves to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Cattleyopsis species are prized for their ornamental value and are often cultivated in greenhouses or as houseplants. Their flowers, which can be white, pink, or yellow, bloom in clusters and are known for their longevity."
