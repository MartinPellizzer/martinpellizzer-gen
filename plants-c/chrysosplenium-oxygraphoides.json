    "intro": "Chrysosplenium oxygraphoides, commonly known as the golden spleenwort, is a small evergreen herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant features dark green, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a low, mat-like structure. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in early spring. Due to its ornamental value and preference for shaded, moist environments, it is sometimes cultivated in woodland gardens."
