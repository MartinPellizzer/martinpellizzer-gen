    "intro": "Carex petricosa var. franklinii, commonly known as Franklin's rock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils in woodland or alpine environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its ornamental appeal in garden settings. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
