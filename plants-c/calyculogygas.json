    "intro": "Calyculogygas, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Calyculogygas has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered critically endangered and is found only in a few remote locations in Southeast Asia."
