    "intro": "Curtonus, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a striking contrast between the petals and the green calyx. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the stems are erect and branching. Curtonus is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
