    "intro": "Coelogyne phuhinrongklaensis, commonly known as the Phu Hin Rong Kla orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand. It is a terrestrial orchid with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many Coelogyne species. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
