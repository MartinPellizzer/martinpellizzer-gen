    "intro": "Conopsidium platantherum, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a small perennial herb belonging to the orchid family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy yellow flower that blooms in late summer. The plant is native to moist, shaded woodlands in eastern North America. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
