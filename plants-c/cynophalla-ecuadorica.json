    "intro": "Cynophalla ecuadorica, commonly known as the Ecuadorian cynophalla, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and often hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
