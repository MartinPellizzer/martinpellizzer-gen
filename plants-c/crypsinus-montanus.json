    "intro": "Crypsinus montanus, commonly known as the mountain crypts, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, a common feature among members of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
