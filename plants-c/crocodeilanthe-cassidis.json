    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe cassidis, commonly known as the dragon scale fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble dragon scales. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with dense, clustered roots that help it attach to tree trunks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are dimorphic, with fertile and sterile fronds differing in structure and appearance. Crocodeilanthe cassidis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
