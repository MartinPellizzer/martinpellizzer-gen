    "intro": "Ceradenia jimenezii, commonly known as the Jimenez's ceradenia, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant purple and white flowers, which bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are elliptical and covered in a fine, velvety texture, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ceradenia jimenezii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
