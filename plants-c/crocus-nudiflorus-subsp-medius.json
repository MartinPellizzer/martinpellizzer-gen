    "intro": "Crocus nudiflorus subsp. medius, commonly known as the early crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It produces delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and has a compact growth habit. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in dry, well-drained soils, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its early blooming and ornamental appeal."
