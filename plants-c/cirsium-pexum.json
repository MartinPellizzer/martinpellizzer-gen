    "intro": "Cirsium pexum, commonly known as the alpine thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are usually spiny and covered in dense, white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Cirsium pexum produces purple to pink flower heads that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
