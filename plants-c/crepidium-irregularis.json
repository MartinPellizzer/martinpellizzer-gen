    "intro": "Crepidium irregularis, commonly known as the irregular orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture. The orchid's unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
