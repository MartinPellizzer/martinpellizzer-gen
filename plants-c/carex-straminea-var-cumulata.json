    "intro": "Carex straminea var. cumulata, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to mountainous regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to silver-gray in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in moist, shady areas."
