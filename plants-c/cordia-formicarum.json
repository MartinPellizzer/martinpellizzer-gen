    "intro": "Cordia formicarum, commonly known as the honeycomb tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark that resembles a honeycomb, and its opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange or red, fleshy fruits that are edible and often consumed by both humans and animals. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in medicine and as a source of timber."
