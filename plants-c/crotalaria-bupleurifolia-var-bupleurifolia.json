    "intro": "Crotalaria bupleurifolia var. bupleurifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf crotalaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its compound leaves with elongated leaflets and distinctive yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, and the plant is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability due to symbiotic bacteria in its root system. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
