    "intro": "Cedrela huberi, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its straight, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. Cedrela huberi is often found in lowland rainforests and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
