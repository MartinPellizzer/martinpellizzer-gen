It is characterized by its long, arching leaves that are typically variegated with white and green stripes. The plant produces small, grass-like inflorescences that bear white or yellow flowers. It is a popular houseplant due to its ease of care and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Chlorophytum glaucum is also known for its ability to purify air and propagate easily through offsets."
