    "intro": "Cupressus thuya, commonly known as the Western red cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown bark and scale-like leaves that are arranged in crossed pairs. The tree produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green cones that mature into woody, oval-shaped seed cones. Its foliage is dense and provides excellent wind resistance, making it suitable for landscaping in arid regions. The wood of Cupressus thuya is highly durable and resistant to decay, historically valued for construction and carving."
