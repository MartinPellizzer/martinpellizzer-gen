    "intro": "Crinum graminicola, commonly known as the grassland crinum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense clumps. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and often covered in a waxy coating. Crinum graminicola is adapted to grow in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks."
