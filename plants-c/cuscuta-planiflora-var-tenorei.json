    "intro": "Cuscuta planiflora var. tenorei, commonly known as the Italian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it often infests crops and ornamental plants. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a significant agricultural pest. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in certain ecosystems by influencing plant community dynamics."
