    "intro": "Centaurea borealis, commonly known as the alpine centaury, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its bright blue or violet flowers bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Centaurea borealis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine environment."
