    "intro": "Cotoneaster buxifolius, commonly known as the boxleaf cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy, resembling the foliage of boxwood. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used as a hedging plant or in rock gardens."
