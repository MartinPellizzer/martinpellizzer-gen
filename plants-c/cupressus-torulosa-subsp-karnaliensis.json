    "intro": "Cupressus torulosa subsp. karnaliensis, commonly known as the Karnali cypress, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and dense, scale-like foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, thriving in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
