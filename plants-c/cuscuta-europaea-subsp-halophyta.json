    "intro": "Cuscuta europaea subsp. halophyta, commonly known as the salt marsh dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It typically attaches to a variety of hosts, including grasses and shrubs, using specialized structures called haustoria. The plant is adapted to saline environments, making it a common inhabitant of coastal areas and salt marshes. Its small, yellow-orange flowers are often clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat preferences, it plays a unique role in coastal ecosystems."
