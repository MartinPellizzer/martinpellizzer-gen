    "intro": "Cephalaria gigantea, commonly known as the giant cephalaria, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its tall, branched stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower heads composed of numerous small florets, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Cephalaria gigantea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its dramatic visual impact."
