    "intro": "Chavica pyrifolia, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that change color with the seasons, typically displaying vibrant red, orange, and yellow hues in autumn. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Chavica pyrifolia is popular in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and seasonal color changes."
