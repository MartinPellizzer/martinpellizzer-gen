    "intro": "Centaurea albonitens, commonly known as the white-centred knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and bright yellow flowers with a distinctive white center. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Centaurea albonitens is a hardy species that thrives in sunny conditions and is relatively drought-tolerant."
