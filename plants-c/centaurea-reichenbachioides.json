It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features striking blue to violet flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Centaurea reichenbachioides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils."
