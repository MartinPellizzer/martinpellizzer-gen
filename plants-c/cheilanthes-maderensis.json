    "intro": "Cheilanthes maderensis, commonly known as the Madera rock fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 10 inches in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny environments. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. It is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
