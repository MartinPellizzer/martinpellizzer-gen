The plant exhibits a climbing habit, utilizing its specialized tendrils to attach to supports and maximize sunlight exposure. Its leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from pale pink to deep purple. This species is native to arid regions and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
