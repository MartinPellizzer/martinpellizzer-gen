    "intro": "Cerasus pumila, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or Japanese dwarf cherry, is a small deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, tart red or pink fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its ornamental value comes from its early spring blooms and delicate foliage. Cerasus pumila is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
