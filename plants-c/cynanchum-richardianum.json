    "intro": "Cynanchum richardianum, commonly known as Richard's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its latex contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested. Cynanchum richardianum is often found in dry grasslands and rocky soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
