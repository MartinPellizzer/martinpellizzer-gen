    "intro": "Crepis atribarba f. pend-oreillensis, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a rare and specialized plant species found in high-altitude environments. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
