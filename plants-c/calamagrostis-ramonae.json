    "intro": "Calamagrostis ramonae, commonly known as the Ramon grass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
