    "intro": "Cinnamomum quadrangulum, commonly known as the Japanese cinnamon or Chinese cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, bark-like fruits that are used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by reddish berries, which contain the seeds used for culinary and medicinal purposes. Its aromatic properties are primarily derived from the oils found in its bark and leaves. Cinnamomum quadrangulum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its essential oils, which have been used for centuries in various cultural practices."
