    "intro": "Cortiella glacialis, commonly known as the glacier cup lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cold, high-altitude environments. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus with a smooth, cup-like shape. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor, harsh conditions. It is often found on rock surfaces in arctic and alpine regions. Its slow growth and specialized habitat make it an indicator species for environmental stability."
