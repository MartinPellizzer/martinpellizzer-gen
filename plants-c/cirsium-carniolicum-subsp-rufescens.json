    "intro": "Cirsium carniolicum subsp. rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountains of the Balkans and parts of Italy. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems that become reddish-brown with age, and its basal leaves that are lanceolate with serrated edges. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming from late summer to early autumn. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
