    "intro": "Carex acuta f. melanolepis, commonly known as the black-leaved tufted sedge, is a variant of the tufted sedge species native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green to almost black foliage, which gives it a striking appearance in both natural and cultivated settings. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly pointed tip, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in wet conditions, making it a useful addition to water gardens and ecological restoration projects."
