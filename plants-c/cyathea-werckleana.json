    "intro": "Cyathea werckleana, commonly known as the Wercklean shield fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a layer of persistent, fibrous roots. The plant produces large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length, with a distinctive shield-shaped base. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that develop on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its role in spore dispersal. Cyathea werckleana is often found in humid, shaded environments, making it a common sight in tropical rainforests."
