    "intro": "Cunila pycnantha, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, aromatic stems and fern-like, pinnately compound leaves that emit a distinctive licorice-like fragrance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which give it the species name \"pycnantha,\" meaning \"dense fruit.\" Its flowers are followed by small, oval-shaped seeds enclosed in a fibrous husk. Cunila pycnantha is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine."
