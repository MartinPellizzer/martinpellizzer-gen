    "intro": "Cuscuta arabica, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant attaches to its host using haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the host's vascular system. It is often found parasitizing crops such as beans, cotton, and tomatoes. Its rapid growth and ability to spread quickly make it a significant agricultural pest."
