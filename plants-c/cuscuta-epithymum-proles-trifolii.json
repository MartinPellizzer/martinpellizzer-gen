    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum proles trifolii, commonly known as the trailing dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant typically attaches to hosts such as legumes or grasses using specialized root-like structures called haustoria. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in agricultural settings. Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years."
