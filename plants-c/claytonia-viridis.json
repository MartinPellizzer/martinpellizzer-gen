    "intro": "Claytonia viridis, commonly known as the green spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Claytonia viridis is a member of the Montiaceae family and is known for its ephemeral blooming period, lasting only a few weeks."
