    "intro": "Cordyline longifolia, commonly known as the long leaf cordyline, is a striking evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features tall, slender stems with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense clumps over time."
