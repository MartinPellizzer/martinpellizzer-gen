    "intro": "Cephalophyllum insigne, commonly known as the star cactus, is a rare and striking plant native to the deserts of Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that bloom in a vibrant array of colors. The plant has a short, thick stem with spines and produces clusters of small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. Its flowers are typically solitary and appear at the top of the stem, making it a visually captivating species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
