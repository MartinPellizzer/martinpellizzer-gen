    "intro": "Cryptotaeniopsis davidi, commonly known as the David's cryptotaeniopsis, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and other similar species. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
