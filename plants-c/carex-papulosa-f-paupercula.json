    "intro": "Carex papulosa f. paupercula, commonly known as the sparse-squamate sedge, is a variant of the common sedge species Carex papulosa. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of two distinct spikelets, with the lower one being shorter and more compact. The leaves are usually shorter and less densely packed compared to the typical form, giving it a more sparse appearance."
