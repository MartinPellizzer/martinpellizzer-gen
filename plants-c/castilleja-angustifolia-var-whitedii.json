    "intro": "Castilleja angustifolia var. whitedii, commonly known as the narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its bright red to orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it has a root system that connects to the roots of neighboring plants, allowing it to absorb some of their nutrients. This species is native to the western United States and is often found in regions with dry, sunny conditions."
