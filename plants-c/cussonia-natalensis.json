    "intro": "Cussonia natalensis, commonly known as Natal arrowroot, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features large, palmately lobed leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by clustered, orange-red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The roots of Cussonia natalensis are valued for their starchy texture and have been used as a food source in some regions."
