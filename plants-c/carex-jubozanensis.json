    "intro": "Carex jubozanensis, commonly known as the Jubozan sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It produces small, clustered flowers in early summer, which are followed by distinctive three-angled berries. Carex jubozanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
