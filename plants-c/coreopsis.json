    "intro": "Coreopsis, commonly known as tickseed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to North America and are known for their bright, daisy-like flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Coreopsis species are typically herbaceous perennials, though some are annuals, and they thrive in full sun and well-drained soil. They are popular in gardens for their ease of care and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant's foliage is usually narrow and grass-like, with some species featuring hairy or finely toothed leaves."
