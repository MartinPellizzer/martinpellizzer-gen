    "intro": "Carex harlandii, commonly known as Harland's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Carex harlandii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
