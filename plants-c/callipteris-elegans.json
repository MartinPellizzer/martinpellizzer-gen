    "intro": "Callipteris elegans, commonly known as the silky sand cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of wetlands. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
