    "intro": "Cerastium cerastoides var. lanceolatocalyx, commonly known as the lanceolate calyx chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its elongated calyx lobes, which set it apart from other members of the Cerastium genus."
