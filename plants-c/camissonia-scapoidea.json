It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom in early spring. Camissonia scapoidea typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Its slender stem and clustered inflorescence make it distinctive among native wildflowers."
