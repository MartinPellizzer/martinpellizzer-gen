    "intro": "Cyathea muriculata, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, light green fronds. The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various organisms."
