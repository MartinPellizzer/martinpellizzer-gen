    "intro": "Callitropsis funebris, commonly known as the mourning pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and a conical shape that gives it a somber appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, typical of the coniferous family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Callitropsis funebris is considered a vulnerable species."
