    "intro": "Cirsium abruptum, commonly known as the rough thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a rough texture, while its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets. Cirsium abruptum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
