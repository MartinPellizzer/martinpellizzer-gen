    "intro": "Cuscuta approximata var. urceolata, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread across various habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants, making it both a nuisance and a subject of ecological study."
