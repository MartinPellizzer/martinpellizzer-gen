    "intro": "Cuscuta chlorocarpa, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts to establish a connection. The plant is native to various regions of the United States and is often found growing on agricultural crops and weeds. Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to its host plants."
