    "intro": "Cardia fruticulosa, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in areas exposed to salt spray. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers in dense, brush-like clusters, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh coastal environments."
