    "intro": "Calycera pulvinata f. cauligera, commonly known as the cushion calycera, is a unique horticultural form of the species Calycera pulvinata. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing, cushion-like growth habit, which makes it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, adding a striking visual contrast to its compact foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. This form is prized for its ornamental value and adaptability to rocky or gravelly landscapes."
