    "intro": "Cenia discolor, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghosts, hence its common name. The plant has a slender, leafless stem and produces small, elongated leaves that are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
