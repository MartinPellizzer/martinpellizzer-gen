    "intro": "Charlwoodia australis, commonly known as the Australian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, pale yellow wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species and is protected in several Australian states."
