    "intro": "Carex rotundata f. pallida, commonly known as the pale sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its pale green foliage and compact growth habit make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
