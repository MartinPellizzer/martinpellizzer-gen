    "intro": "Cyathea australis var. glauca, commonly known as the glaucous tree fern, is a species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a distinctive grayish-blue sheen on its fronds, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. This fern is a slow-growing plant that can live for several decades, contributing to the ecological structure of its habitat."
