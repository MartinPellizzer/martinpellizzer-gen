It is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive, often branched thorns. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a leathery texture that helps it conserve water. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in arid environments for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
