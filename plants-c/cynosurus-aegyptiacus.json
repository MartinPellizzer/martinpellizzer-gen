    "intro": "Cynosurus aegyptiacus, commonly known as Egyptian couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow with a slightly hairy surface. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. The plant is often considered a weed but can play a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
