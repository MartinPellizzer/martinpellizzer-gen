    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 laurae, commonly known as the Laura's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats and has a long flowering period, often lasting several weeks. Its foliage consists of broad, leathery leaves that help it thrive in low-light conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
