    "intro": "Campanula cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas bellflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
