    "intro": "Cordia prunifolia, commonly known as the cherry-leaved cordia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its oval-shaped, leathery leaves that are typically reddish-brown when young and turn dark green with age. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or white, followed by orange or red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Cordia prunifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal flowering."
