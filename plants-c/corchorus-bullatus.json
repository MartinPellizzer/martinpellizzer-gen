    "intro": "Corchorus bullatus, commonly known as the Chinese broomrape, is a flowering plant native to China and other parts of East Asia. It is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense spikes. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous, woody capsule, which can persist in the soil for several years. Due to its parasitic nature and unique ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant interactions."
