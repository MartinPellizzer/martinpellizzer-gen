    "intro": "Calophaca nigricans var. tianschanica, commonly known as the Tianshan calophaca, is a rare alpine plant native to the Tianshan mountain range in Central Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. It is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and limited sunlight. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
