    "intro": "Cyperus umbellatus var. cylindrostachys, commonly known as the narrow-stalked flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in wetland environments, including marshes and the edges of ponds, and is often found in disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a common indicator of waterlogged conditions."
