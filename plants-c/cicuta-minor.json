    "intro": "Cicuta minor, commonly known as water hemlock, is a toxic member of the carrot family (Apiaceae). It is a biennial herb that typically grows in wet, disturbed soils along streambanks and marshes. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels. Its most notable feature is the highly poisonous, hollow, cylindrical stem, which contains toxic alkaloids. Due to its extreme toxicity, even small amounts can be lethal to humans and animals."
