    "intro": "Crocus biflorus subsp. yataganensis, commonly known as the Yatagan crocus, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, corm-based growth habit and produces showy, saucer-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge after the flowering period. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
