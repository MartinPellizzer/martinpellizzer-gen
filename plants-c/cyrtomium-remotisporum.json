    "intro": "Cyrtomium remotisporum, commonly known as the remote spore fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori. Cyrtomium remotisporum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
