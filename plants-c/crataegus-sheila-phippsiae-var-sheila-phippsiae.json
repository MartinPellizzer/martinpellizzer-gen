    "intro": "Crataegus sheila-phippsiae var. sheila-phippsiae, commonly known as Sheila Phipps' hawthorn, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red berries in the fall. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges and a glossy green upper surface. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
