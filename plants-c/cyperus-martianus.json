    "intro": "Cyperus martianus, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in wetland habitats such as marshes and shallow water areas. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Cyperus martianus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
