    "intro": "Calyptrogyne costatifrons subsp. costatifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandpipergrass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and adaptation to sandy, saline environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in coastal dunes and salt marshes, playing a role in stabilizing these dynamic ecosystems. Its morphology reflects its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, coastal conditions."
