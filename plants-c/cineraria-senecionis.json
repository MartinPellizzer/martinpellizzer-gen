It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, often bluish-green leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which can be toxic to livestock. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous."
