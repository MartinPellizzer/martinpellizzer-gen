    "intro": "Cronquistianthus chachapoyensis, commonly known as the Chachapoya flamebush, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Peruvian Andes. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its striking, bright red floral displays. The plant features palmate leaves with a velvety texture and produces showy, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
