    "intro": "Cyperus indecorus var. inflatus, commonly known as the inflated flatsedge, is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It is often found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. This variant is distinguished by its inflated, balloon-like structures at the base of the inflorescence, which give it its common name."
