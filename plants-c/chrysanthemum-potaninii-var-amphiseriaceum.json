    "intro": "Chrysanthemum potaninii var. amphiseriaceum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chrysanthemum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-white leaves that give it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white during the late summer and early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a cut flower."
