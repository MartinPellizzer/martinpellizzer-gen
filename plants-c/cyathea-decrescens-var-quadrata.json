    "intro": "Cyathea decrescens var. quadrata, commonly known as the broad-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, with the trunk often developing a bulbous base known as a caudex. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
