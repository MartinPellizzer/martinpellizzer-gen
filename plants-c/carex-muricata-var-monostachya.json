    "intro": "Carex muricata var. monostachya, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along streambanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette, and it produces spikes of small, inconspicuous flowers in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
