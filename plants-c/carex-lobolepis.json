    "intro": "Carex lobolepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often slightly folded along the midrib. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, arranged in dense inflorescences called spikes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Carex lobolepis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
