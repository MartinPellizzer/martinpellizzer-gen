    "intro": "Cheilanthes rigida, commonly known as the rigid maidenhair fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in crevices, where it can access moisture from dripping water. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. Cheilanthes rigida is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species in harsh environments."
