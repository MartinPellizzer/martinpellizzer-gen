    "intro": "Cyclophorus annamensis, commonly known as the Annam cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid, both contributing to its reproductive strategy. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil, often found in forested areas. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
