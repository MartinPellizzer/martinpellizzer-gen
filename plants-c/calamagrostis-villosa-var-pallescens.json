    "intro": "Calamagrostis villosa var. pallescens, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. This variety typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to wetland landscapes. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
