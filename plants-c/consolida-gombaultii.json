    "intro": "Consolida gombaultii, commonly known as the Gombault's sweet pea, is a species of flowering plant in the Fabaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and is characterized by its climbing habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces slender, twisting stems that support its clusters of pea-like blossoms, which range in color from white to pink and purple. Its foliage consists of pinnately compound leaves, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. The flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
