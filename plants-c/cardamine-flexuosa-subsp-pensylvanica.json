    "intro": "Cardamine flexuosa subsp. pensylvanica, commonly known as Pennsylvania watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant has alternate, trifoliate leaves with finely toothed margins, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its root system is fibrous, and it is often found in calcareous soils. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
