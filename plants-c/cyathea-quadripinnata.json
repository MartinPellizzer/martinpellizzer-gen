    "intro": "Cyathea quadripinnata, commonly known as the four-feather tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are pinnately compound, with multiple levels of branching, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
