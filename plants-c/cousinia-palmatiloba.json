It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in mountainous areas. Cousinia palmatiloba is adapted to survive in extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
