    "intro": "Cremanthodium yadongense, commonly known as the Yadong flower, is a rare alpine plant native to the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cold, dry climates and well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to minimize water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
