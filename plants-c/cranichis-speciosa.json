    "intro": "Cranichis speciosa, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swampy areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil. Cranichis speciosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
