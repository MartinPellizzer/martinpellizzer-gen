    "intro": "Cyathea chimborazensis var. maxonii, commonly known as the Chimborazo tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, providing structural support and enabling it to anchor firmly in rocky or soil substrates. This variant is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptation to its high-altitude habitat."
