    "intro": "Cyclophorus blepharolepis, commonly known as the eye-leaf cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often brightly colored leaves that resemble eyes, hence its common name. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered with a fibrous, spongy layer. Its reproductive structures include a large, cone-like strobilus that produces seeds. This cycad is native to certain regions of Africa and is adapted to grow in sandy, well-drained soils."
