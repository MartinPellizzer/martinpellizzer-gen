It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy, growing in dense clumps. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers, which are often green or brown in color. It thrives in full to partial sun and requires consistently moist soil conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
