    "intro": "Cystopus occultus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in specific, humid environments, often found in the shaded understories of tropical forests. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to its elusive nature and habitat requirements, Cystopus occultus is considered a highly endangered species."
