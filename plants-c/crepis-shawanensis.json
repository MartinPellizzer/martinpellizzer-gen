It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, silver-gray leaves and daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across rugged terrains. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
