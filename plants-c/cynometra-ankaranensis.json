    "intro": "Cynometra ankaranensis, commonly known as the Madagascar ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Sterculiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cynometra ankaranensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
