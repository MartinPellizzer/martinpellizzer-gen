    "intro": "Carlina acaulis var. eckartsbergensis, commonly known as the Eckartsberg's velvet gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, with dense clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine gardens."
