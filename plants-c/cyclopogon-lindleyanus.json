    "intro": "Cyclopogon lindleyanus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
