    "intro": "Corydalis washingtoniana, commonly known as the Washington corydalis, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its roots are tuberous and contribute to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
