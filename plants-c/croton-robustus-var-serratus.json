    "intro": "Croton robustus var. serratus, commonly known as the serrated croton, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary appeal lies in its striking foliage."
