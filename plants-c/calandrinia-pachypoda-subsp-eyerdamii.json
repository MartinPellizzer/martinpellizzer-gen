    "intro": "Calandrinia pachypoda subsp. eyerdamii, commonly known as the Eyerdam's purslane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves, characteristic of the Portulacaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to drought conditions, with a shallow root system and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss."
