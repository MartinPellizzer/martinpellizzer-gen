    "intro": "Canavalia munroi, commonly known as the coastal bean or sea bean, is a leguminous plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in tidal zones, where it tolerates salt spray and periodic flooding. Canavalia munroi plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
