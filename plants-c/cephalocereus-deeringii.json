It is characterized by its distinctive red or yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a short, thick stem with a single, spiny areole, and its roots are adapted to absorb moisture efficiently. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and blooming habits, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
