    "intro": "Cirsium foliosum var. minganense, commonly known as the Mingan thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the rocky and acidic soils of the Mingan Archipelago in Quebec, Canada. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and large, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy purple to pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a rounded inflorescence. It is adapted to harsh coastal environments and is often found in open, sun-exposed areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
