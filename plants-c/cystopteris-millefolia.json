    "intro": "Cystopteris millefolia, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to various regions across North America, Europe, and Asia. The plant's fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving them a lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Cystopteris millefolia reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and a gametophyte stage."
