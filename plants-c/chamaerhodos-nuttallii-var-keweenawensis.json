It thrives in acidic, wet soils found in bogs and fens, showcasing its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. This variant is distinguished by its geographic distribution and specific ecological requirements, making it a unique species within the Gentianaceae family."
