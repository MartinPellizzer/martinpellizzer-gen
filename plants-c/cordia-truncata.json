It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable species in ecological restoration projects."
