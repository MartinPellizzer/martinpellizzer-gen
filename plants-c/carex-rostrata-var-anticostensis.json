It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained soil. Its flowering spikes are usually borne on tall, slender stems, producing small, clustered flowers that are wind-pollinated.
