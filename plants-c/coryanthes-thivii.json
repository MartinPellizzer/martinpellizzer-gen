    "intro": "Coryanthes thivii, commonly known as the Thivier's coryanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, with intricate, often colorful patterns on the petals and sepals. The plant produces a unique structure called a \"lip,\" which serves as a landing platform for pollinators. Its growth is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native environment."
