    "intro": "Carex paucicostata, commonly known as narrow-ribbed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream sides. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Carex paucicostata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse ecological communities."
