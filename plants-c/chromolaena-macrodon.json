    "intro": "Chromolaena macrodon, commonly known as the horseweed or chromolaena, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. Chromolaena macrodon is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
