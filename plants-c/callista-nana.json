    "intro": "Callista nana, commonly known as dwarf callista, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens."
