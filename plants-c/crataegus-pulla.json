    "intro": "Crataegus pulla, commonly known as the blackthorn or sloe, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa, and is characterized by its thorny branches and small, dark purple berries. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which give way to the edible, bitter fruits in late summer. Crataegus pulla is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and rocky soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife. Its berries are used in traditional remedies and for making jams and liqueurs."
