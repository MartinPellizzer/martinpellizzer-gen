    "intro": "Coptosapelta diffusa, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores in specialized structures called sorus. Its slow growth rate and specific habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Coptosapelta diffusa is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
