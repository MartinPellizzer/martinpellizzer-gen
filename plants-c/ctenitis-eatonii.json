    "intro": "Ctenitis eatonii, commonly known as the Eaton's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and longevity. Its fronds are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the trunk, giving it a distinctive appearance. Ctenitis eatonii is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the undergrowth."
