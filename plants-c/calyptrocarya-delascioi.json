It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its distinctive morphology. The plant features a slender, unbranched stem with a single, elongated leaf that is often covered in a dense, waxy layer. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in terminal inflorescences, and it produces fruits that are small and drupaceous. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calyptrocarya delascioi is considered a species of conservation concern."
