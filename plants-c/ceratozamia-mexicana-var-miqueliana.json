    "intro": "Ceratozamia mexicana var. miqueliana, commonly known as the Miquel's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to grow in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
