    "intro": "Cerastium brachypetalum subsp. iranicum, commonly known as the Iranian mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically rounded and covered in fine pubescence, while the flowers are pink or white and bloom in early spring. This species thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to high-altitude conditions."
