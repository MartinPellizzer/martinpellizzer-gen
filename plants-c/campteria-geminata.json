    "intro": "Campteria geminata, commonly known as the twinleaf campteria, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of ovate, hairy leaves that are often divided into two lobes, giving it the common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and thrives in moist, temperate climates. Campteria geminata is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
