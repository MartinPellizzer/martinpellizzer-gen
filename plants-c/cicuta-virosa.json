    "intro": "Cicuta virosa, commonly known as water hemlock, is a highly toxic member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils along stream banks, marshes, and roadside ditches. Its roots contain potent toxins, including cicutoxin, which can cause severe poisoning in humans and animals. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
