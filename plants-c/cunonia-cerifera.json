    "intro": "Cunonia cerifera, commonly known as the candlewood tree, is a species native to southern Africa. It is a tall, evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters in height, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in panicles, and it produces woody, candle-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional medicine."
