    "intro": "Coriaria tinctoria, commonly known as the dyer's coriander, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Coriariaceae and is characterized by its small, white, fragrant flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, round berries that contain a toxic compound called coriamide, which is responsible for its medicinal and poisonous properties. It has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a dye due to its chemical compounds. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to handle."
