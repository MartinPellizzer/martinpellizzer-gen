    "intro": "Carya ovata var. borealis, commonly known as the northern hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the northern United States and eastern Canada. It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its compound leaves with 11 to 21 leaflets. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which are typically harvested in the fall. Its bark is deeply furrowed and becomes thicker with age, providing a distinctive appearance. The northern hickory is adapted to temperate climates and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
