It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a slightly rough texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense spikes. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
