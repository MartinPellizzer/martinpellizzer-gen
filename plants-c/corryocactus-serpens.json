It is characterized by its long, cylindrical stems that resemble serpents, hence its common name. The plant features spiny areoles and produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Its distinctive appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
