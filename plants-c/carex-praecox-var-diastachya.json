    "intro": "Carex praecox var. diastachya, commonly known as the early sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This variety typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, and it blooms in early spring. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
