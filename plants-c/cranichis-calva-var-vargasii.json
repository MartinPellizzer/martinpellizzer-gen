    "intro": "Cranichis calva var. vargasii, commonly known as the Vargas orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it faces threats to its survival in the wild."
