    "intro": "Craibia laurentii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its straight-grained, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a smooth texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody fruits containing seeds. Due to overharvesting, Craibia laurentii is now classified as an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
