It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and a slight waxy coating. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
