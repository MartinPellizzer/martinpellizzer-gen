    "intro": "Calanthe discolor f. bicolor, commonly known as the bicolor calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique bicoloration, featuring contrasting white and greenish-yellow petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive filtered sunlight. Its flowers, which bloom in early spring, are small but intricate, with a delicate fragrance that attracts pollinators. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
