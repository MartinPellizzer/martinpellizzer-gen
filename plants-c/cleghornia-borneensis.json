    "intro": "Cleghornia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean cleghornia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink and white. It is typically found growing in shaded, humid environments within the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
