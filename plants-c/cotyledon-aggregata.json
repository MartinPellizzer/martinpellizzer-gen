    "intro": "Cotyledon aggregata, commonly known as the \"Clustered Cotyledon,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially when exposed to bright light. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and reduce transpiration. Cotyledon aggregata is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
