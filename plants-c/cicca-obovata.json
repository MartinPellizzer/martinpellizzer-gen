    "intro": "Cicca obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate cycad, is a species of cycad native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, palm-like leaves that are obovate in shape. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being more compact and woody. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
