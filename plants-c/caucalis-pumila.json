    "intro": "Caucalis pumila, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to full sun exposure. Caucalis pumila is often found in coastal areas and dry meadows, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
