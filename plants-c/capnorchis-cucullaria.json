    "intro": "Capnorchis cucullaria, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a hood-like lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Capnorchis cucullaria is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
