    "intro": "Corryocactus prostratus, commonly known as the creeping corryocactus, is a low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a sprawling, mat-forming growth habit with pale green stems that are covered in small, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant."
