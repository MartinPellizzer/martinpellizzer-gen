    "intro": "Cerastium rishirense, commonly known as the Japanese snowflat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
