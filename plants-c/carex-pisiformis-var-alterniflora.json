It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
