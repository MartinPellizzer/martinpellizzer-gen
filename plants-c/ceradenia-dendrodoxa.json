    "intro": "Ceradenia dendrodoxa, commonly known as the tree fern, is a striking member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a dense layer of persistent, fibrous roots. The plant produces a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth rate, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
