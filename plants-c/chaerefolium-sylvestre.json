    "intro": "Chaerefolium sylvestre, commonly known as the wood anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in woodland habitats, thriving in partial shade and moist, well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. Its flowers are often accompanied by a single, prominent yellow nectar guide at the base. Chaerefolium sylvestre is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
