    "intro": "Cracca fulvinervis, commonly known as the yellow wood sorrel, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with a distinctive yellowish vein pattern, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water. Its botanical features make it both an ornamental plant and a potential weed in certain ecosystems."
