It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and wastelands. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, and the plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in harsh conditions. It is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance."
