    "intro": "Cerastium polymorphum var. mollifolium, commonly known as the soft-leaved mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically rounded and covered in a fine, soft pubescence, giving the plant its varietal name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local insect populations."
