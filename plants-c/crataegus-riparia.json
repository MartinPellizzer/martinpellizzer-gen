    "intro": "Crataegus riparia, commonly known as the river hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the wetlands and stream banks of North America. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters and features slender, often arching branches. The plant produces white to pinkish flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its small, red berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with serrated edges and a smooth, glossy surface."
