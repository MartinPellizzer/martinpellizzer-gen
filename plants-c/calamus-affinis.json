    "intro": "Calamus affinis, commonly known as the common calamus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features long, narrow, ribbon-like leaves that can grow up to several feet in length, often floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, and it thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Calamus affinis is often used in traditional medicine and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties. Its presence is an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
