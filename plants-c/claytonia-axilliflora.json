    "intro": "Claytonia axilliflora, commonly known as the rock lettuce, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery coating. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in the axils of the leaves, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Claytonia axilliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
