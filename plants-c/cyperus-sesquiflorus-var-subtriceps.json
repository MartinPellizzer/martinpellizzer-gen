    "intro": "Cyperus sesquiflorus var. subtriceps, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to yellowish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. Botanically, it belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants."
