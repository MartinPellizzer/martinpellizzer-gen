    "intro": "Carex tenax var. leucensis, commonly known as the white-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, grasses, and other related plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically white or pale green in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often found in northern regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems."
