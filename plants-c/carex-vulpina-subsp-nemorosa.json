    "intro": "Carex vulpina subsp. nemorosa, commonly known as the wood sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in wetland areas. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its aesthetic appeal in natural landscapes."
