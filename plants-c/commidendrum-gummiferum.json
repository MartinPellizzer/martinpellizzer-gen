The plant is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. It produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. The plant is known for its ability to produce a sticky, resinous substance from its trunk, which has been used by indigenous peoples for various purposes."
