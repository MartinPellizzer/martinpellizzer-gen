    "intro": "Callitriche hermaphroditica var. bicarpellaris, commonly known as the two-carpelled water starwort, is a flowering plant species native to freshwater environments in North America. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic herb with whorled leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is notable for its hermaphroditic flowers, which contain both male and female reproductive structures. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind and water. This species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish."
