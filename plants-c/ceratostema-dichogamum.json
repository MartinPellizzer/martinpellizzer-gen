    "intro": "Ceratostema dichogamum, commonly known as the mountain snowbell, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It prefers well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in forested or shrubland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
