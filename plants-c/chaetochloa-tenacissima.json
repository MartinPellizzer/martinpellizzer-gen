    "intro": "Chaetochloa tenacissima, commonly known as the hardstem bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it plays an important ecological role in arid regions."
