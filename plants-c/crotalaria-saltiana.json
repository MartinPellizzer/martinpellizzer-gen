    "intro": "Crotalaria saltiana, commonly known as the saltbush crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its small, yellow, spurred flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is adapted to saline and drought conditions, making it resilient in harsh environments. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod, which aids in seed dispersal. Crotalaria saltiana plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in revegetation projects in degraded areas."
