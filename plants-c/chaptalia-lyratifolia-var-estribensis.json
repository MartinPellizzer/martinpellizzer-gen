    "intro": "Chaptalia lyratifolia var. estribensis, commonly known as the Estribes mountain thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, hairy leaves that are often covered in white or yellowish pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers arranged in a single terminal head, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically between 2,500 and 4,000 meters above sea level. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species, often found in rocky or alpine slopes."
