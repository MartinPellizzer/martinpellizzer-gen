    "intro": "Candollea pedunculata, commonly known as the slender glassworts, is a halophyte species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in estuaries and tidal flats. The plant has succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, aiding its survival in harsh, arid environments. Its small, greenish flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Candollea pedunculata plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
