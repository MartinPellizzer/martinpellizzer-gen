    "intro": "Clematis armandi var. pinfaensis, commonly known as the Pinfaensis Clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to China. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 10 meters, making it suitable for trellises or supports. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are often followed by showy red berries in the fall. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, thriving in temperate climates."
