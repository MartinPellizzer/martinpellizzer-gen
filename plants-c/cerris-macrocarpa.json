    "intro": "Cerris macrocarpa, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by round, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its slow growth and longevity, it is a valuable species in ecological and ornamental horticulture."
