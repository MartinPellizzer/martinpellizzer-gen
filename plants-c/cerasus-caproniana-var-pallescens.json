    "intro": "Cerasus caproniana var. pallescens, commonly known as the white cherry or pallescens cherry, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate aesthetic to its natural habitat. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. Its fruits are small, red drupes that ripen in late summer, though they are not widely cultivated for consumption. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral display, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
