    "intro": "Cassia petersiana var. tomentosa, commonly known as the silky cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, soft, grayish-white pubescence covering the stems and leaves, giving it a velvety appearance. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with three ovate to elliptic leaflets, and the plant produces bright yellow, clustered flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. The seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods and are often used in traditional medicine."
