    "intro": "Caesalpinia californica, commonly known as the California burr legume, is a deciduous shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by distinctive, spiny seed pods that persist through the winter. The plant has compound leaves with oval leaflets and produces small, hairy fruits that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Caesalpinia californica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to local wildlife."
