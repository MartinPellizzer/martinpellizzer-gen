    "intro": "Chaerophyllum reflexum, commonly known as water parsnip, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist soils and is often found along stream banks and in marshy areas. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays an important role in aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
