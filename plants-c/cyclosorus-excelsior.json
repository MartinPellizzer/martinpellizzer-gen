    "intro": "Cyclosorus excelsior, commonly known as the noble water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. This plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Cyclosorus excelsior plays a role in water filtration and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
