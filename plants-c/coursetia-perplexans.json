    "intro": "Coursetia perplexans, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant has thick, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adaptations to reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers, which range from white to pink, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Coursetia perplexans is typically found in rocky soils and is well adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability."
