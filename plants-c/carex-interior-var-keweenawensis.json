    "intro": "Carex interior var. keweenawensis, commonly known as the Keweenaw sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds. Due to its preference for wet environments, it is an indicator species for areas with high water tables."
