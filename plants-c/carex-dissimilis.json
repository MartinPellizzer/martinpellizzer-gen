    "intro": "Carex dissimilis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Carex dissimilis is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
