    "intro": "Cyathea contigua, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, frond-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its tall stem, while the fronds are composed of a central stalk and a series of pinnae. Cyathea contigua plays an important ecological role in tropical rainforests by providing habitat and contributing to forest structure."
