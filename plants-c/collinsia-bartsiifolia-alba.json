It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, thriving in coastal climates with mild temperatures and moderate rainfall. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. This species is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and is protected by conservation efforts in its native range."
