    "intro": "Carya alba var. ovoidea, commonly known as the oval-winged hickory, is a variant of the white hickory native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, winged samaras that are broader and more oval in shape compared to the typical hickory fruits. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a thick, husky shell, which are a food source for various wildlife species. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The tree thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
