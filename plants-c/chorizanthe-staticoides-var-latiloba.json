It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its adaptations include deep root systems and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss."
