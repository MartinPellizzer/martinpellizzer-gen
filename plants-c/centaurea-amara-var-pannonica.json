It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter tall, covered with fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, conical clusters, typical of the genus Centaurea. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, contributing to its bitter taste. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
