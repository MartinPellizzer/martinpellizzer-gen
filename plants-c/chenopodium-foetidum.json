    "intro": "Chenopodium foetidum, commonly known as skunk mustard, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and alternate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along streambanks. Due to its strong odor, it is sometimes considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
