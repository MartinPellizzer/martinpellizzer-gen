    "intro": "Commiphora agar, commonly known as Indian gum or guggul, is a small evergreen tree native to the arid regions of India, Pakistan, and the Middle East. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap, which is harvested from its bark and branches. The plant produces a sticky, amber-colored gum called guggul, which has been used for centuries in traditional medicine. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in panicles, and the fruit is a three-lobed, woody capsule."
