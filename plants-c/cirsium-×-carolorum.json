It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Cirsium \u00d7 carolorum is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
