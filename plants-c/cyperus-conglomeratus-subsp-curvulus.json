    "intro": "Cyperus conglomeratus subsp. curvulus, commonly known as the curled flatsedge, is a grass-like plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. This subspecies is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along water bodies. It has rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
