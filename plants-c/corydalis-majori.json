It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces a distinctive seed pod that splits open to release its seeds, a feature common in the genus Corydalis. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Corydalis majori is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and early spring blooms."
