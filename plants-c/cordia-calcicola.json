    "intro": "Cordia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone cordia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, ovate leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Cordia calcicola is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
