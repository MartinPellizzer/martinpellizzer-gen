    "intro": "Carnegiea eximia, commonly known as the Saguaro cactus, is a tall, tree-like cactus native to the Sonoran Desert of Arizona and northern Mexico. It has a distinctive, ribbed trunk that can grow up to 50 feet tall and is covered in spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which bloom along the ribs and are pollinated by bats and insects. Its shallow root system allows it to absorb water quickly after rare rainfall events. The Saguaro cactus is a keystone species in its ecosystem, providing habitat and food for numerous desert animals."
