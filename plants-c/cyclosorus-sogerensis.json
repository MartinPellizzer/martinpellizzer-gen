    "intro": "Cyclosorus sogerensis, commonly known as the Soger's water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant has four to six leaflets arranged in a whorl, and it produces tiny, floating fruits that contain minute seeds. Cyclosorus sogerensis thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with muddy substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
