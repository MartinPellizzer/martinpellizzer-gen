    "intro": "Crataegus repentina, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are edible for birds and some mammals. Crataegus repentina is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife and traditional herbal medicine."
