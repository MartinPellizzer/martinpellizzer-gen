    "intro": "Calyptranthes clarendonensis, commonly known as the Clarendon mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of white or pale green flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host trees, typically members of the Moraceae family. It produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local bird species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
