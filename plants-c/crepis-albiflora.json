    "intro": "Crepis albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered mouse-ear. It is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae, characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers and hairy, silver-green leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in grassy habitats and disturbed soils. The plant produces achenes, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Its botanical features make it a common sight in meadows and along roadsides."
