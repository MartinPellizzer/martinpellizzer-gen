It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Conicosia communis is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
