    "intro": "Cirsium remotifolium var. remotifolium, commonly known as the distant-leaved thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, silver-green leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces purple to pinkish-purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spherical shape at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and protected areas."
