    "intro": "Craccina longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed craccina, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants such as carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Craccina longipes is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its growth habit and foliage make it a valuable component of ecological studies on plant diversity and habitat specificity."
