    "intro": "Cactus ciliare, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains. Overall, Cactus ciliare is a resilient plant well-suited to harsh desert environments."
