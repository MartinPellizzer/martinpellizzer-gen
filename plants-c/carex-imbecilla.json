    "intro": "Carex imbecilla, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually narrow and grassy, with a dark green color and a slightly rough texture. Carex imbecilla is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
