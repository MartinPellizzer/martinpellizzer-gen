    "intro": "Cuspidaria biebersteinii var. stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited cuspidaria, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and distinctive, narrow, berry-like fruits. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a pale greenish-white color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
