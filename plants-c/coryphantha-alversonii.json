    "intro": "Coryphantha alversonii, commonly known as the Alverson\u2019s prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, cylindrical stems covered in spines and areoles, which are specialized structures for hosting flowers and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by fruit that splits open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Coryphantha alversonii is often found in rocky habitats and is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
