    "intro": "Celastrus subspicatus, commonly known as the prickly coral tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright orange berries that are attractive to birds. Its bark is typically smooth and light gray, with a tendency to exfoliate. Celastrus subspicatus is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woodlands."
