    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris f. polypetala, commonly known as the broad-leaved heather, is a variant of the common heather. It is characterized by its broader, more rounded leaves compared to the typical narrow leaves of Calluna vulgaris. The plant produces dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white in color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wildlife."
