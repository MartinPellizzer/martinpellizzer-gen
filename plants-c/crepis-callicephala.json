    "intro": "Crepis callicephala, commonly known as the showy hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its bright yellow flowers, which appear in summer, are surrounded by pale green bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. Crepis callicephala is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments."
