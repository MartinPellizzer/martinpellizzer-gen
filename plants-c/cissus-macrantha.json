    "intro": "Cissus macrantha, commonly known as the large-leafed grape ivy, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often adorned with small, white spots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, grape-like berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cissus macrantha is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ability to climb or trail."
