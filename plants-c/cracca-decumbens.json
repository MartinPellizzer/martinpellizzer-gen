    "intro": "Cracca decumbens, commonly known as the creeping cracca, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant prefers well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. Cracca decumbens is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and coastal areas."
