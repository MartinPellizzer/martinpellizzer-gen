    "intro": "Chamaebetula nana, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a low-growing shrub native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its bark is thin and peels easily, revealing a reddish inner layer. Chamaebetula nana plays an important ecological role in providing food and shelter for various Arctic wildlife species."
