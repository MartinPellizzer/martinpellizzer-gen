It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bright green, and it produces small, clustered spikes of yellowish-brown flowers in the summer. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poorly drained soils and its preference for full to partial sunlight. This subspecies is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
