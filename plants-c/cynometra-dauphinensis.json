    "intro": "Cynometra dauphinensis, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local crafts and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
