    "intro": "Croton agrarius, commonly known as the red torch tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, lobed leaves that often display vibrant red or orange hues, especially when damaged or during the growing season. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but can become invasive in some areas."
