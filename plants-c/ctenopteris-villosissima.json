    "intro": "Ctenopteris villosissima, commonly known as the hairy sea palm, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or rocky substrates. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in shallow, tidal zones. Ctenopteris villosissima plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and provides habitat for small marine organisms."
