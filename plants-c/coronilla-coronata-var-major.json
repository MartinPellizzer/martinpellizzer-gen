    "intro": "Coronilla coronata var. major, commonly known as the greater crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
