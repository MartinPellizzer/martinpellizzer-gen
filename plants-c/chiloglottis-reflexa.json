    "intro": "Chiloglottis reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed hens and chicks, is a unique orchid species native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, downward-curving petals and a compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are highly adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
