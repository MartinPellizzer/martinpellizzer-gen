It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a distinctive purple or violet hue at the base. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single flower stem that bears one to three blooms. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
