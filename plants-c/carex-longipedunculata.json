    "intro": "Carex longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-pedunculate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Carex longipedunculata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
