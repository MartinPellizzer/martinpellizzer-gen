    "intro": "Conostylis bealiana, commonly known as the coastal conostylis, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its flowers are usually pale blue or white, and it is often found in dunes or along the margins of salt lakes. Conostylis bealiana plays a role in stabilizing coastal dune systems and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
