    "intro": "Cystopus, commonly known as the bladder grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the grass family. Cystopus species are often found in moist, sandy soils, particularly in coastal areas. They play a role in stabilizing dune environments and are adapted to withstand salt and wind."
