It is characterized by its unique, pleated petals and a vibrant, often yellow or orange, coloration. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and wasps. The varietal name \"pliciferum\" refers to the pleated or folded structure of its petals, a distinctive botanical feature."
