    "intro": "Cyperus lanceus f. densior, commonly known as the dense flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its narrow, sword-shaped leaves are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like inflorescences. This variety is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Cyperus lanceus."
