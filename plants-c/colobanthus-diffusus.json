    "intro": "Colobanthus diffusus, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of the Southern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in harsh environments such as Antarctica, southern South America, and New Zealand. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in loose clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Colobanthus diffusus is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme cold, making it a resilient species in polar and subpolar regions."
