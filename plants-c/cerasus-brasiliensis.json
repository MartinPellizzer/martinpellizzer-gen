    "intro": "Cerasus brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or sweet cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental value due to its showy pink to white flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in taste to cherries, though they are typically smaller and more acidic. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun for optimal growth. Cerasus brasiliensis is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
