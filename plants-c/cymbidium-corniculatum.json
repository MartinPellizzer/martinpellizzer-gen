    "intro": "Cymbidium corniculatum, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in winter or early spring. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces inflorescences with several flowers arranged in a raceme. Cymbidium corniculatum is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in segments, and it requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light to thrive. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and as a potted plant."
