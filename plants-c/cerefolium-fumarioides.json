    "intro": "Cerefolium fumarioides, commonly known as the alpine smokeplant, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and flowering structures. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late spring. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, hairy layer, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Cerefolium fumarioides is typically found in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
