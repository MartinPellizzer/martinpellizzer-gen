    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale var. todaroi, commonly known as the autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a corm, which is its primary storage organ. It is adapted to grow in woodland or meadow habitats with moist, well-drained soil. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
