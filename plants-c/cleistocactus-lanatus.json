    "intro": "Cleistocactus lanatus, commonly known as the woolly night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly coating that covers its stems, providing insulation and protection from intense sunlight. The plant produces showy, nocturnal flowers that open at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its stems are typically cylindrical and segmented, with spines that are often reduced or absent. Cleistocactus lanatus is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a hardy plant for xerophytic gardens."
