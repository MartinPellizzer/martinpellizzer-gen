    "intro": "Crataegus latebrosa, commonly known as the late-bloom dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and showy white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Crataegus latebrosa is often found in woodlands and along streambanks, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
