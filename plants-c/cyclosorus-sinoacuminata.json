    "intro": "Cyclosorus sinoacuminata, commonly known as the Chinese cyclosorus, is a member of the Marsileaceae family, characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. It is a small, floating or submerged plant with four small, kidney-shaped leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are typically borne on short, erect stalks. It is native to East Asia, particularly China, and thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and aquatic ecosystem researchers."
