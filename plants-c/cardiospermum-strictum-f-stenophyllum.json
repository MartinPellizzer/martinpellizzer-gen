    "intro": "Cardiospermum strictum f. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hurricane vine, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical species. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds, a feature typical of the genus Cardiospermum. This variety is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments."
