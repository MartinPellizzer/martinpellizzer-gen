    "intro": "Cistus salviifolius var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant rock rose, is a flowering shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its grey-green, aromatic foliage and clusters of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant leaves and long-lasting blooms."
