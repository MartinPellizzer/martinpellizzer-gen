    "intro": "Coccothrinax proctorii, commonly known as the Proctor's palm, is a species of palm native to the island of Hispaniola. It is a small, slender palm with a single trunk and feather-like leaves that are typically green and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into clusters of black, spherical fruits. It thrives in coastal and limestone habitats, often growing in dry, sunny environments. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
