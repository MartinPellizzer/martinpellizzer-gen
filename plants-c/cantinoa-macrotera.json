    "intro": "Cantinoa macrotera, commonly known as the large-flowered cantinoa, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Cantinoa macrotera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
