    "intro": "Cladobium longicolle, commonly known as the long-necked lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive, leaf-like thallus with a pale green to yellowish coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. Cladobium longicolle is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Its structure and growth patterns make it an important indicator species for environmental health."
