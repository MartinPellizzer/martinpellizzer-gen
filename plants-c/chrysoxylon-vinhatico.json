    "intro": "Chrysoxylon vinhatico, commonly known as the Vietnamese golden wood, is a rare tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its dense, golden-yellow heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows in lowland evergreen forests and thrives in humid, tropical climates. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a glossy surface, while its flowers are small and clustered. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
