    "intro": "Cryptarrhena quadricornu, commonly known as the four-horned grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Cryptarrhena quadricornu is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
