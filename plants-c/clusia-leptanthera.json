    "intro": "Clusia leptanthera, commonly known as the golden trumpet tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces showy, tubular yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural spread. Clusia leptanthera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, tropical conditions."
