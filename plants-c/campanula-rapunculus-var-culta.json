    "intro": "Campanula rapunculus var. culta, commonly known as the garden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and spread through rhizomes."
