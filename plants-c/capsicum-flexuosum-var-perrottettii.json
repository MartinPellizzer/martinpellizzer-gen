    "intro": "Capsicum flexuosum var. perrottettii, commonly known as the Perrottet's yellow bell pepper, is a rare and ornamental variety of chili pepper native to South America. It is characterized by its elongated, hanging fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its unique appearance rather than for culinary use. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
