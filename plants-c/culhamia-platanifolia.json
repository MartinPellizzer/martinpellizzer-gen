    "intro": "Culhamia platanifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf culhamia, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that resemble the shape of a plane tree, hence its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or along riverbanks. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Culhamia platanifolia is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
