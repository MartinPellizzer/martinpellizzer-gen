    "intro": "Carpinus sepium, commonly known as the European hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, grey bark that develops shallow fissures with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by small, edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Carpinus sepium is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
