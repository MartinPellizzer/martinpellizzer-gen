    "intro": "Carex rotundata var. major, commonly known as the large round-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves that are usually rounded at the base and have a dense, clustered growth habit. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, three-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This sedge plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
