It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Platt's goldenbush is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
