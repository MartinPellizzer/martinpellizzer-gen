    "intro": "Cornus capitata, commonly known as the sweet cherry or cornelian cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, yellow flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are edible and have a tart, slightly sweet flavor. Cornus capitata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to both ecological and horticultural landscapes."
