    "intro": "Casearia singularis, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, pale-gray bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine white powder. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in saline and waterlogged soils, making it an important species in mangrove ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate salt and tidal conditions contributes to its role in coastal stabilization and biodiversity."
