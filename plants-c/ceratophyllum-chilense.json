    "intro": "Ceratophyllum chilense, commonly known as the Chilean hornwort, is a unique aquatic plant native to South America. It is a submerged, stemless plant that lacks true roots, instead relying on its branching structure for anchorage. The plant features small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by water currents. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in aquariums and wetland restoration projects."
