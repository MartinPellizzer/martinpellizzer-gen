    "intro": "Centaurium pulchellum var. altaicum, commonly known as the highland centaury, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. This variety is part of the Gentianaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in mountain ecosystems."
