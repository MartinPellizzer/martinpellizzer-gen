    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum var. subobtusata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found growing on crops such as rice and vegetables. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique parasitic lifestyle and ecological impact on agricultural systems."
