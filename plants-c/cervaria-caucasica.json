    "intro": "Cervaria caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of the Caucasus. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a fibrous root system that attaches to the roots of its host plants. It is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by influencing the growth and distribution of its host species."
