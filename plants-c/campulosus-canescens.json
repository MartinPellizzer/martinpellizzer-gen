It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and small, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Campulosus canescens is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
