    "intro": "Cephalaria attenuata var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf cephalaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, and its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in loose panicles, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and native plant collections."
