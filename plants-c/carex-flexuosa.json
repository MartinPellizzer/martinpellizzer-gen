    "intro": "Carex flexuosa, commonly known as soft-stemmed sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and stream banks. The plant has grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in three rows, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Carex flexuosa plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
