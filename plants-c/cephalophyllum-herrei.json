    "intro": "Cephalophyllum herrei, commonly known as the yellow star of Bethlehem, is a rare and striking member of the Apocynaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its unique, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It has a succulent, branched stem and small, narrow leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
