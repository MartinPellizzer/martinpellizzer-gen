    "intro": "Collaea glaucescens, commonly known as the silverleaf lily, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is covered in a fine layer of wax, which gives it its distinctive appearance and helps reduce water loss. Collaea glaucescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
