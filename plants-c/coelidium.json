    "intro": "Coelidium, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, erect stem that bears a capitulum of small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Coelidium species are often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, and the flowers are followed by small, bristly achenes that are dispersed by the wind."
