    "intro": "Carlina longicaulis, commonly known as the longstem cudweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, daisy-like composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Carlina longicaulis plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
