    "intro": "Corallodendron latissimum, commonly known as the broadleaf coral tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and its striking coral-like inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically simple, alternate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Corallodendron latissimum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
