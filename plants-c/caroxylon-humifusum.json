    "intro": "Caroxylon humifusum, commonly known as the dwarf desert shrub, is a resilient plant adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources in dry soils. Caroxylon humifusum plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
