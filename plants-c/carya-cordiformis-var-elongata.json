    "intro": "Carya cordiformis var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated hickory, is a variant of the bitternut hickory. It is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has distinctive heart-shaped leaves that are longer and narrower than those of the typical bitternut hickory. Its fruit is a spiny husk containing a single nut, which is edible but has a bitter taste. The elongated hickory is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in woodworking and furniture making."
