    "intro": "Coleosanthus cedrosensis, commonly known as the Cedros Island lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Cedros in the Gulf of California. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy white flowers with a purple tinge. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal habitats and is adapted to the arid and saline conditions of its environment. It has narrow, strap-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
