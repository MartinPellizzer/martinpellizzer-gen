    "intro": "Clematis coccinea, commonly known as the red clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Clematis coccinea is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and can climb trellises or fences with its strong, woody stems."
