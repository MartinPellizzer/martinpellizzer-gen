    "intro": "Citronella colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian citronella, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Colombia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and clusters of small, pale-green to yellowish flowers. The plant is known for its strong, lemony scent, which is produced by the essential oils in its leaves and stems. These oils are often harvested for their aromatic and insect-repelling properties. Citronella colombiana thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated in regions with well-drained soil and ample sunlight."
