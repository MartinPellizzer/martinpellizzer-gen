    "intro": "Courbonia, commonly known as the wild fig or Courbon's fig, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes other figs and mulberries. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. Courbonia produces small, clustered fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature, though some varieties may turn red or yellow. It is often valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits in specific climates."
