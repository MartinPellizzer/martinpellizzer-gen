    "intro": "Chrysanthemum arcticum subsp. maekawanum, commonly known as the Maekawanum chrysanthemum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pale pink, often blooming in late summer. Its foliage is usually covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in extreme conditions."
