    "intro": "Cissus ruacanensis, commonly known as the Ruacana grapevine, is a climbing plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its tendrils that help it climb and spread across surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by berries that are typically yellow or red when mature. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy surface, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Cissus ruacanensis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
