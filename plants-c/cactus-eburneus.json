    "intro": "Cactus eburneus, commonly known as the white cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 15 centimeters. The plant features a globular stem covered in a whitish, powdery coating that helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange and bloom in the spring. Cactus eburneus is adapted to extreme drought conditions and requires minimal care once established."
