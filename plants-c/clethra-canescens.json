    "intro": "Clethra canescens, commonly known as the gray clethra, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its grayish-white bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Clethra canescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
