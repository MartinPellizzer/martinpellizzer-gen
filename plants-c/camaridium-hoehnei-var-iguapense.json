    "intro": "Camaridium hoehnei var. iguapense, commonly known as the Iguape mountain orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the late summer and early autumn months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, organic-rich substrates for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species with conservation efforts focused on protecting its natural habitat."
