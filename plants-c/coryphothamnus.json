    "intro": "Coryphothamnus, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to the western United States and are characterized by their dense, evergreen foliage and showy yellow flowers. Coryphothamnus species typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, exhibiting adaptations such as small, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. They often form low, shrub-like growths and are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils. The genus includes several species, each with unique floral and foliar characteristics."
