    "intro": "Cucurbita mixta var. stenosperma, commonly known as the narrow-seeded squash, is a variant of the Cucurbita mixta species native to Central America. It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical fruits with a smooth, dark green rind and pale yellow to orange flesh. The plant produces monoecious flowers, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, typical of many cucurbit species. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and deeply lobed, with a rough texture. This variety is valued for its culinary use and is often cultivated for both its nutritional content and ornamental appeal."
