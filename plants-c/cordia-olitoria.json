It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and as a vegetable in some cultures. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by round, cotton-like seed pods. Its roots and leaves contain bioactive compounds, making it valuable in both traditional and modern pharmacological applications. Cordia olitoria is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, contributing to its ecological significance in arid and semi-arid regions."
