    "intro": "Crumenaria, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, soft hairs on the leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, often displaying shades of white or pink. Crumenaria species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. They are often valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
