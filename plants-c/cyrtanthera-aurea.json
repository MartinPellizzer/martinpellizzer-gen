    "intro": "Cyrtanthera aurea, commonly known as the golden sand orchid, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Cyrtanthera aurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
