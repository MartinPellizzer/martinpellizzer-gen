    "intro": "Cassia melanocarpa, commonly known as the black cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 centimeters long and composed of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in panicles, which bloom in the spring and summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated, flat pods that mature to a dark brown color. Cassia melanocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
