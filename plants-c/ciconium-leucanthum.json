It features striking white, showy flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Ciconium leucanthum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
