    "intro": "Chloris montana, commonly known as mountain grass or slender bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Americas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Chloris montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
