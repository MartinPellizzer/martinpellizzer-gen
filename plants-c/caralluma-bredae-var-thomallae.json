    "intro": "Caralluma bredae var. thomallae, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, which bloom at night, hence its common name. It has a slow growth rate and is often used in rock gardens due to its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Caralluma bredae var. thomallae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
