    "intro": "Chimonanthus fragrans, commonly known as the winter sweet, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, even when other plants are still dormant. The plant has opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds. Chimonanthus fragrans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is valued in traditional Chinese medicine."
