    "intro": "Cerastium lanatum f. macranthum, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a flowering plant in the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white to grayish foliage and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arctic environments. It has a low-growing habit, forming a mat-like structure that helps it survive in harsh conditions. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
