    "intro": "Cynoglossum phardycalyx, commonly known as the Armenian throatwort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers with five lobes, typical of the Boraginaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
