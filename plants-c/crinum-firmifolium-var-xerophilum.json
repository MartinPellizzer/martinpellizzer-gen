    "intro": "Crinum firmifolium var. xerophilum, commonly known as the desert crinum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid regions of South America. It features strap-like, narrow leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens."
