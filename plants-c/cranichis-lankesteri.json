    "intro": "Cranichis lankesteri, commonly known as the Lankester's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the highlands of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its floral structure includes a narrow, elongated labellum, which is a distinguishing feature among orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
