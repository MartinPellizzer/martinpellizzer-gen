    "intro": "Carpanthus, commonly known as the fountain grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is native to South Africa and consists of several species, many of which are ornamental due to their attractive, tufted flower clusters. The plants typically grow in clumps, with slender, grass-like leaves and showy, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in summer. Carpanthus species are often used in landscaping for their drought tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Their botanical features make them suitable for both garden and natural habitats."
