    "intro": "Carex paniculata var. squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrose sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet to moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its botanical characteristics include a rhizomatous growth habit and the presence of bracts that are often squarrose at the base. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
