    "intro": "Calystegia pubescens f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered bindweed, is a variant of the species Calystegia pubescens. It is a herbaceous perennial vine characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are predominantly white, which distinguish it from other forms of bindweed. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in various habitats across temperate regions. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
