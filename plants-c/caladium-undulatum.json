    "intro": "Caladium undulatum, commonly known as the wavy-leaf caladium, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, wavy-edged leaves that come in shades of green, red, and white. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the main ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for gardens and container planting. Caladium undulatum is typically grown as an annual in cooler climates but can be perennial in tropical regions."
