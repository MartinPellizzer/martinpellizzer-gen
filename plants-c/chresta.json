    "intro": "Chresta, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, erect stalks rising from water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic life. Its flowers typically open in the early morning and close at night, a process known as nyctinasty. Chresta is also valued for its symbolic significance in many cultures, representing purity and enlightenment."
