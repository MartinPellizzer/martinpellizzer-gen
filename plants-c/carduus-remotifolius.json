    "intro": "Carduus remotifolius, commonly known as the distant-leaved thistle, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a tall, branched flower head that produces purple to pink flowers. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, and the plant produces a milky sap that is characteristic of the Cynara genus. It is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its distinctive appearance."
