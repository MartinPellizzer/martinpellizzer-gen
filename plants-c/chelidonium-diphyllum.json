It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lobed leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. Its latex contains alkaloids, which have been used historically in traditional medicine. However, it is toxic and should not be ingested without proper guidance."
