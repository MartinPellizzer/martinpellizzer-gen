It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats and has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. It is known for its medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
