    "intro": "Calypso bulbosa f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered broomrape, is a rare and striking plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on its host for nutrients while still performing some photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its lack of leaves and its clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
