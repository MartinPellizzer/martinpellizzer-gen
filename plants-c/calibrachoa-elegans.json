It is native to South America, particularly Chile, and is known for its cascading clusters of small, brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as a trailing or shrub-like perennial, with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink and purple, bloom throughout the growing season. Calibrachoa elegans is often cultivated in gardens and as a container plant due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
