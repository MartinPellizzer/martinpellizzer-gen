    "intro": "Cupressus duclouxiana subsp. likiangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan cypress, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It is characterized by its dense, columnar growth habit and scaly, reddish-brown bark that exudes a distinct aromatic resin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by cylindrical cones containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist climates. Due to its limited natural range and habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species."
