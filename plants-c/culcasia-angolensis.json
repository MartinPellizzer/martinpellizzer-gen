    "intro": "Culcasia angolensis, commonly known as the African giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, which float on the water's surface. The plant has a distinctive spongy, air-filled stem that helps it stay afloat. Its flowers are showy, with a white or pinkish color, and they open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Culcasia angolensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
