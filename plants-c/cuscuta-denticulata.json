    "intro": "Cuscuta denticulata, commonly known as the toothed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true leaves, stems, or roots. It attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on various agricultural and wild plants. It is native to North America and is considered a weed in some regions. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it can significantly impact the growth of the plants it parasitizes."
