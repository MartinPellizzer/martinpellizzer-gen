    "intro": "Coffea canephora var. hiernii, commonly known as the Congolese coffee or Hiern's coffee, is a lesser-known variety of the robusta coffee species. It is native to Central and West Africa, particularly found in countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Cameroon. This plant is characterized by its large, oval-shaped leaves and produces dark red, oblong berries containing two seeds. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. While not as widely cultivated as other coffee varieties, it is valued for its unique flavor profile and resilience to certain pests and diseases."
