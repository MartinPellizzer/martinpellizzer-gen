    "intro": "Calamus oblatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue or black berries. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their starchy roots, which are used in traditional medicine and as a food source. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
