    "intro": "Clidemia crenata, commonly known as Hawaiian snowberry, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with wavy edges, and it produces small, round berries that are typically white or pale green. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
