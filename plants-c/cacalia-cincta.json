    "intro": "Cacalia cincta, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cacalia cincta thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
