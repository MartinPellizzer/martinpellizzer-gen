    "intro": "Conioselinum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf wormwood, is a low-growing annual herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features narrow, gray-green leaves with a distinctive silvery-white coating, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
