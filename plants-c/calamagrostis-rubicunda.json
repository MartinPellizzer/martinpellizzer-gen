    "intro": "Calamagrostis rubicunda, commonly known as the red panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with dense, reddish-purple inflorescences that give it its striking appearance. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially along the edges. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Calamagrostis rubicunda is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
