    "intro": "Coreopsoides lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf coreopsis, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers with prominent central disk and ray florets, blooming from late spring to early fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained sandy or loamy soils. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to native gardens."
