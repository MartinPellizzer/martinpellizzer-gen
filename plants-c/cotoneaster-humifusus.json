    "intro": "Cotoneaster humifusus, commonly known as the creeping cotoneaster, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
