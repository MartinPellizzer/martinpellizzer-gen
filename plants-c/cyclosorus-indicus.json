    "intro": "Cyclosorus indicus, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its floating, four-leaf clover-like fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is native to parts of Asia, including India and Southeast Asia. Its reproductive structures, known as sporocarps, are small, floating capsules that release spores into the water. Cyclosorus indicus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
