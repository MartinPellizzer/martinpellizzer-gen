    "intro": "Chrysanthemum abrotanifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chrysanthemum, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is cultivated both for aesthetic and practical purposes."
