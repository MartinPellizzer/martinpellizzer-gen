    "intro": "Carex lagopus, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is often found in wet or moist environments such as bogs, marshes, and tundra. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in its habitat. Carex lagopus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
