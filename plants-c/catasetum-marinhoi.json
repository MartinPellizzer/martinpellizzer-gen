    "intro": "Catasetum marinhoi, commonly known as the marine catasetum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that are typically large and showy. The plant produces a unique structure called a galea, which is a specialized appendage at the base of the column that aids in pollination. Its leaves are usually broad and strap-like, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Catasetum marinhoi is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and ecological significance in its native habitat."
