    "intro": "Cyclosorus albosetosus, commonly known as the white-haired water fern, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its fronds are covered with fine, white hairs, which contribute to its common name. Cyclosorus albosetosus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and aiding in water filtration."
