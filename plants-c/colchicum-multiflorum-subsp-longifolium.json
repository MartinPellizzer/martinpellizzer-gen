    "intro": "Colchicum multiflorum subsp. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features basal leaves that are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its bulbs are toxic and contain colchicine, a compound used in medicine. This subspecies is typically found in woodland areas and meadows, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil."
