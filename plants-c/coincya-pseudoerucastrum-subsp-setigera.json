    "intro": "Coincya pseudoerucastrum subsp. setigera, commonly known as the slender water starwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, star-shaped leaves. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The leaves are usually floating or submersed, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, contributing to its role in aquatic ecosystems. This subspecies is notable for its morphological adaptations to its aquatic habitat."
