    "intro": "Cnidoscolus conicus, commonly known as the spiny leaf huito, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent spines along the margins. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, spiky fruits that contain a starchy, tuberous pulp. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in moist lowland forests."
