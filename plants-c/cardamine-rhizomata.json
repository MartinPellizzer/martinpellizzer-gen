    "intro": "Cardamine rhizomata, commonly known as water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant characterized by its floating leaves and rhizomatous growth habit. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters, and it produces elongated, cylindrical fruits. Cardamine rhizomata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
