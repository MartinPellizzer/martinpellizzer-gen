    "intro": "Calamus longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed arrowroot, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is a tall, slender palm characterized by its long, slender leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by orange-red fruits containing winged seeds. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their starchy, edible roots, which are used in traditional cuisine. Calamus longipes thrives in wet, tropical environments and is often found in swampy or marshy areas."
