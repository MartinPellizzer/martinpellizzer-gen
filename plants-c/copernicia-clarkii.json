    "intro": "Copernicia clarkii, commonly known as the Clark's copernicia, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean islands. It is a small, shrub-like plant that typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spiny, woody fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with long, narrow leaflets that are often covered in a waxy coating. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to tropical coastal environments."
