    "intro": "Cattleya tigrina, commonly known as the tiger orchid, is a species native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety, dark green leaves and its large, showy flowers with intricate patterns resembling tiger stripes. The flowers typically bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red, with contrasting dark markings. This orchid is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and it relies on humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. It is prized in horticulture for its beauty and fragrance, making it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
