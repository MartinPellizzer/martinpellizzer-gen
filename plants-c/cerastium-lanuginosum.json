    "intro": "Cerastium lanuginosum, commonly known as the downy mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs, giving it a soft, downy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Cerastium lanuginosum is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
