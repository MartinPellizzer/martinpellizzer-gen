It features small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely toothed, ovate leaves that are often covered in a soft, grayish pubescence. Its fruits are small, red berries that contain toxic seeds, making it important to handle with care. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks."
