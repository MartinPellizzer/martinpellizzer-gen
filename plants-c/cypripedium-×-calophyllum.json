    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 calophyllum, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow pouch-shaped flower, which serves as a pollination trap. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires well-drained, acidic soil. It has a short rhizome and produces a single, showy flower per stem. Cypripedium \u00d7 calophyllum is valued for its ornamental beauty but is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
