    "intro": "Cyrtorchis, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to the Mediterranean region and are characterized by their compact, often rock-dwelling growth habit. Cyrtorchis species typically have small, showy flowers that are often pink, purple, or white in color. They are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on rocks or trees, and require well-drained, mineral-rich substrates. Due to their specific habitat requirements, many species are rare and face threats from habitat loss and over-collection."
