    "intro": "Comus, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, slender stalks rising from water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. Comus is known for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving water, making it a popular choice for ponds and water gardens. Its symbolic significance in various cultures further enhances its botanical and cultural importance."
