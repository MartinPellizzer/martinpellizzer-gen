    "intro": "Chytroma rorida, commonly known as the coastal daisy, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with silver-gray foliage that helps it withstand salty sea air. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines. Chytroma rorida is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in coastal environments."
