    "intro": "Corchorus japonicus var. flore-pleno, commonly known as the Japanese kochia, is a variant of the kochia species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its densely branched, fluffy, and showy inflorescences that resemble small, colorful clouds, typically in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant is an annual herb that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its foliage is lance-shaped with a slight pubescence, and the leaves are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant's ornamental value has made it a popular choice for garden use, particularly in containers and as a seasonal accent plant."
