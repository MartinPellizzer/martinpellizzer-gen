    "intro": "Coryphantha vivipara var. alversonii, commonly known as the Alverson's livebearing cactus, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered with white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of live-bearing fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
