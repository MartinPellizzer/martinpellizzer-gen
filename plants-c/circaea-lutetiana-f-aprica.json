It belongs to the honeysuckle family (Caprifoliaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The subspecies f. aprica is distinguished by its earlier flowering and more compact growth compared to the typical form."
