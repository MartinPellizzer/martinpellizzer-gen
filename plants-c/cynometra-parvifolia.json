    "intro": "Cynometra parvifolia, commonly known as the small-fruited ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for construction and traditional uses."
