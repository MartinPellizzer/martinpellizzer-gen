    "intro": "Clutia pulchella, commonly known as the velvetleaf or beauty leaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are often a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming during the rainy season. Clutia pulchella is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
