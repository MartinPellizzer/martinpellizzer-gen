    "intro": "Cousinia macroptera, commonly known as the large-leaf cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has grayish-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments. Cousinia macroptera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
