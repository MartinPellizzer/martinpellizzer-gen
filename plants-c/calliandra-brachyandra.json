    "intro": "Calliandra brachyandra, commonly known as the pink shower tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery, pink to red bract clusters that resemble small flowers, which appear in dense, showy inflorescences. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by flattened, seed-containing pods. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Calliandra brachyandra is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agroforestry systems."
