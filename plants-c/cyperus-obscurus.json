It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, often forming dense stands. Cyperus obscurus has small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively."
