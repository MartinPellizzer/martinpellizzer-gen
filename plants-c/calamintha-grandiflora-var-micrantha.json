    "intro": "Calamintha grandiflora var. micrantha, commonly known as narrowleaf catnip, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, aromatic stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its foliage is often used in herbal teas and has mild aromatic properties similar to traditional catnip."
