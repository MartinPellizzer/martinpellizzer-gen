    "intro": "Chamaecrista roigii, commonly known as the Mexican burr legume, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, spiny pods that contain small, bean-like seeds. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen, which enriches the soil. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
