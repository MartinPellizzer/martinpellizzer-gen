    "intro": "Crotalaria somalensis, commonly known as Somali crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Somalia and Ethiopia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant has a bushy growth habit and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry and nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in semi-arid regions."
