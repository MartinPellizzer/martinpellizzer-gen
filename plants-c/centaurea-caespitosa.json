    "intro": "Centaurea caespitosa, commonly known as the mouse ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, spiny leaves that resemble mouse ears. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a distinctive purple or black central disk, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in gardens. Centaurea caespitosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal medicine."
