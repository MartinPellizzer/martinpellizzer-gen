    "intro": "Cluacena vaccinioides, commonly known as the red-flowered heath, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped red flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its small, leathery leaves are arranged in whorls, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for native birds. Cluacena vaccinioides is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological significance in its native habitat."
