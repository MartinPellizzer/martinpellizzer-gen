    "intro": "Ceradenia kookenamae, commonly known as the Kooken's ceradenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking violet to purple petals and a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in cloud forests. Its flowers bloom during the cooler months, and it is known for its delicate, fragrant blossoms. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ceradenia kookenamae is considered a critically endangered species."
