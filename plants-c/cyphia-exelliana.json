    "intro": "Cyphia exelliana, commonly known as the Christmas star, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive, star-shaped leaves that are dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in winter, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. Cyphia exelliana is well-suited to humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. It is a popular ornamental plant in gardens due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
