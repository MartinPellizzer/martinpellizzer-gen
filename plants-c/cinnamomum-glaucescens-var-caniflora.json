    "intro": "Cinnamomum glaucescens var. caniflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinnamon tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often coated with a waxy layer, giving them a bluish sheen. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by oval, reddish-brown berries containing aromatic seeds. It is valued for its essential oils, which are used in perfumery and traditional medicine. Its growth habit and ornamental qualities make it a popular choice for horticultural use in warm climates."
