    "intro": "Cymbachne guineensis subvar. lateriticola, commonly known as the lateritic grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in well-drained, lateritic soils and is often found in degraded or disturbed habitats. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a bluish-green coloration, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This grass plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in agroforestry systems."
