It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland areas or stream banks. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators like bees and flies. The fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats."
