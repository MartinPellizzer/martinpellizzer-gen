    "intro": "Connarus fasciculatus subsp. fasciculatus, commonly known as the clustered connarus, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in compact inflorescences, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. This species is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
