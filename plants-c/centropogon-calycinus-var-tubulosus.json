    "intro": "Centropogon calycinus var. tubulosus, commonly known as the tubular centropogon, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a slightly hairy surface. The tubular shape of its flowers is adapted for pollination by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
