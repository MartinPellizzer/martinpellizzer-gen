    "intro": "Cycas annaikalensis, commonly known as the Annaikalensis cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically bright green. Native to the Western Ghats of India, this cycad thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. Its cones, which are separate for male and female plants, are an important feature for its reproduction. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
