    "intro": "Catasetum dodsonianum, commonly known as the Dodson's orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with contrasting purple or red markings, and it produces a unique structure called a \"labellum\" that aids in pollination. Catasetum dodsonianum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
