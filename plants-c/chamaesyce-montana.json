    "intro": "Chamaesyce montana, commonly known as mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant features small, green, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are tiny, yellowish-green, and appear in clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer. Chamaesyce montana is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions."
