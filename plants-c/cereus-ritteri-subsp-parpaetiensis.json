It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are typically green and sparsely covered with small, white spines. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical features make it a striking addition to xeriscaped gardens and a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
