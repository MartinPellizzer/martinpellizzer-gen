    "intro": "Cyathea hemiepiphytica, commonly known as the hemiepiphytic tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It exhibits a unique hemiepiphytic growth habit, beginning its life as an epiphyte on tree trunks before developing roots that reach the ground. The plant has a tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a dark green, leathery texture and a distinctive, elongated shape. Cyathea hemiepiphytica plays an important ecological role in tropical forests by contributing to canopy structure and providing habitat for various organisms."
