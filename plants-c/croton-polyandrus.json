    "intro": "Croton polyandrus, commonly known as the red croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage, with leaves that often display shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Croton polyandrus thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary appeal lies in its striking visual appearance."
