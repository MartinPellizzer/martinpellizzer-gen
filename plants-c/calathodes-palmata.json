    "intro": "Calathodes palmata, commonly known as the palmate calathodes, is a tropical plant characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves. The leaves are large, often reaching several feet in diameter, and are divided into lobes that radiate from a central point, giving the plant a unique, almost fern-like appearance. It is native to humid regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in warm, moist environments. The plant's structure supports its role as a host for various insects and contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and private collections."
