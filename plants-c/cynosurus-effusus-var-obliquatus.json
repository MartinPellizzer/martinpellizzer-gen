    "intro": "Cynosurus effusus var. obliquatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its fibrous roots make it a hardy and resilient plant, often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils."
