    "intro": "Clytostoma decorum, commonly known as the sweet pitcher plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Nepenthaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its striking, pitcher-shaped leaves that are adapted to trap and digest insects. These pitchers are often brightly colored, which helps attract prey. Clytostoma decorum is also notable for its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental value."
