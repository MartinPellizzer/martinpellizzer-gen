    "intro": "Clypeola eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly cup-moss, is a small, epiphytic plant belonging to the family Calypogeeae. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. This moss typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. It has a limited geographic distribution, primarily found in parts of South America. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
