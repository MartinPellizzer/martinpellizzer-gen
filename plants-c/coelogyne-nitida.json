    "intro": "Coelogyne nitida, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with red or purple markings, typically blooming in summer. Coelogyne nitida is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
