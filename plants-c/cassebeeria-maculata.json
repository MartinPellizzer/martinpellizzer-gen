    "intro": "Cassebeeria maculata, commonly known as the spotted cassie, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, simple leaves that are often marked with distinctive spots or patterns. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Cassebeeria maculata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
