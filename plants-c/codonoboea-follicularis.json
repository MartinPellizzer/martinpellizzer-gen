It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its most striking feature is its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The flowers are followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
