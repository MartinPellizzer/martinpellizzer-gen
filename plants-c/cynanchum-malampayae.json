    "intro": "Cynanchum malampayae, commonly known as the Philippine milkweed, is a climbing shrub native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves and produces showy, yellowish-white flowers with a distinctive corona. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered endangered and is of interest in botanical research."
