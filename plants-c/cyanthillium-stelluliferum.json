    "intro": "Cyanthillium stelluliferum, commonly known as the star-leaf sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments. Its unique leaf morphology, with a central vein and radiating lobes, aids in reducing water loss through transpiration. Cyanthillium stelluliferum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in supporting local pollinators."
