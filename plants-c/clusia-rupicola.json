    "intro": "Clusia rupicola, commonly known as the rock clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
