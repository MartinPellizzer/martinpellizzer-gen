    "intro": "Cordia longipeda, commonly known as the longipeda tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It is a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds and mammals. Its roots and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
