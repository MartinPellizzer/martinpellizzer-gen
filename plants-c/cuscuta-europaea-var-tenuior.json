It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. The plant has slender, thread-like stems that twine around its host, forming a dense network. It is commonly found on various agricultural crops and wild plants in Europe and parts of Asia. Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years."
