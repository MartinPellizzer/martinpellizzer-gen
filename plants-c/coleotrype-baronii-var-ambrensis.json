    "intro": "Coleotrype baronii var. ambrensis, commonly known as the Ambrense Baronii Truffle, is a rare and highly prized edible fungus native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Tuberaceae family and is characterized by its unique, aromatic, and often strongly perfumed flesh. The fruiting bodies typically develop underground, forming small, irregularly shaped tubercles that are partially exposed to the soil surface. This variety is distinguished by its pale yellow to cream-colored cap and its ability to form symbiotic relationships with certain tree species. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a delicacy in gourmet cuisine and a subject of botanical interest."
