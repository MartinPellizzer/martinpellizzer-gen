    "intro": "Cuscuta alpicola, commonly known as the alpine dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It is native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and other mountainous areas, where it attaches to various host plants such as grasses and shrubs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of alpine ecosystems by influencing the growth and distribution of its host species. Due to its specialized parasitic lifestyle, it is considered a rare and delicate component of high-altitude flora."
