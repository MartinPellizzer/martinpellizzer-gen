    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris subf. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has compact, leathery leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and rocky areas. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
