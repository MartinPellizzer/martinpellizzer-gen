The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a hairy underside, giving the plant its \"tomentellus\" designation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy ornamental plant. This variety is often used in landscaping for its winter interest and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
