    "intro": "Campanula alburnica, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It features slender stems that often grow in a rosette form, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. Campanula alburnica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
