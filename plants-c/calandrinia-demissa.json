    "intro": "Calandrinia demissa, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its leaves are typically opposite and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Calandrinia demissa is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
