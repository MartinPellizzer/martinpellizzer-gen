    "intro": "Combretum pendulum, commonly known as the weeping combretum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive pendulous branches that give it a drooping, weeping appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are typically ovate or lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Combretum pendulum is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique form and adaptability to various soil types."
