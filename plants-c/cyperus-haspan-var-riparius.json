    "intro": "Cyperus haspan var. riparius, commonly known as the river flatsedge, is a grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its slender, triangular stems are often covered with small, scale-like leaves, and it produces dense clusters of tiny, spike-like flowers. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
