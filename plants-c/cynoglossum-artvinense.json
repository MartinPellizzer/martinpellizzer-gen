    "intro": "Cynoglossum artvinense, commonly known as the Artvin bugloss, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of northeastern Turkey. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive blue to violet flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
