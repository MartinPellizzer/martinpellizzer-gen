    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris laevigata, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white flowers with five petals and produces spherical, three-lobed seed pods that resemble a shepherd's purse, giving it its scientific name. The plant has alternate, oval-shaped leaves that are hairy and often covered with fine white hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along pathways. Its rapid growth and ability to self-seed make it a common weed in agricultural and urban settings."
