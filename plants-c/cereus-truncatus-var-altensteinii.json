    "intro": "Cereus truncatus var. altensteinii, commonly known as the Altenstein's night bloomer, is a succulent cactus native to southern Africa. It features a cylindrical stem with prominent areoles and spines, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers at night, which are a striking feature of its botanical profile. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
