    "intro": "Commelina macrophylla, commonly known as the giant dayflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a white or yellowish center. The plant has heart-shaped, broad leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some areas."
