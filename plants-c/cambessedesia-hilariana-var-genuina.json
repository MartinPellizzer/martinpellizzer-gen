    "intro": "Cambessedesia hilariana var. genuina, commonly known as the Hilarian camphor tree, is a rare and ancient species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and aromatic. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a distinctive texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
