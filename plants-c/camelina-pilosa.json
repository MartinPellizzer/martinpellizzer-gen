    "intro": "Camelina pilosa, commonly known as the hairy camelina, is an annual plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its small, yellow flowers are typically arranged in racemes, and it produces small, round seeds that are adapted for wind dispersal. Camelina pilosa is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
