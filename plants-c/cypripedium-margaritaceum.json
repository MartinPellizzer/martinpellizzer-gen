    "intro": "Cypripedium margaritaceum, commonly known as the pearl orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a white or pale pink coloration with a distinctive yellow or orange lip. The plant has a long, fleshy rhizome and grows in shaded, moist forest environments. Its flowers are often adorned with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of pearls, giving it its common name. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
