    "intro": "Ceratocephala platyceras, commonly known as the broad-lobed helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has lanceolate leaves with prominent veins. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, dark brown seeds in a capsule. The broad-lobed helleborine is often found in association with other orchids and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
