It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and alternate, ovate leaves that are typically green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, followed by dry, three-angled seed capsules. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Smooth lambsquarters is a common weed but also has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a food source."
