    "intro": "Caladenia fragrantissima subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern Fragrant Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid endemic to southeastern Australia. It features a single, slender, erect stem that bears a single, showy, pale yellow to cream-colored flower with a distinctive red lip. The plant typically grows in sandy or loamy soils in open habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. Its flowering period occurs during late winter to early spring, and it is pollinated primarily by thynnid wasps. The species is noted for its fragrant scent, which plays a key role in attracting its specific pollinators."
