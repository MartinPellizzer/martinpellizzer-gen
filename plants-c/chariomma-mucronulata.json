It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in three rows along its stem. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikes and are usually green or reddish in color. Chariomma mucronulata plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
