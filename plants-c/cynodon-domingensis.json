    "intro": "Cynodon domingensis, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted foliage and its ability to thrive in dry, arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and is known for its extensive root system that helps prevent soil erosion. It is widely used in landscaping and as a turfgrass due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Cynodon domingensis is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing forage for livestock and habitat for various insects and small animals."
