It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters, characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires a humid environment to flourish."
