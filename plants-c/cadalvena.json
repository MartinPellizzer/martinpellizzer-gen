    "intro": "Cadalvena, commonly known as the golden star vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fruits are follicles that mature into slender, winged pods, aiding in wind dispersal. Cadalvena is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and delicate floral display."
