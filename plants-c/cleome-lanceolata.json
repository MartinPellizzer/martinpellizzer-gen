    "intro": "Cleome lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf cleome, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems and alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Cleome lanceolata is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It is also valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
