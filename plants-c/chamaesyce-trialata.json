    "intro": "Chamaesyce trialata, commonly known as the redstem sandmat, is a low-growing annual herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically features prostrate stems covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are usually oblanceolate with a waxy coating. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in disturbed areas."
