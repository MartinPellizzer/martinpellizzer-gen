    "intro": "Cuatrecasasiella isernii, commonly known as the Isern's spurge, is a rare and striking plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, branching structure and its striking yellow-orange sap, which is toxic and irritant. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Ecuador, it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant has small, alternate leaves and produces inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
