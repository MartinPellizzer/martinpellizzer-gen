    "intro": "Campanula cephallenica, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It produces striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to cold and harsh environments. Campanula cephallenica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
