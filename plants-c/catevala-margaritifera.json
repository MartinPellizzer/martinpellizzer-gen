    "intro": "Catevala margaritifera, commonly known as the pearlshell orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that resemble pearls, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, and it produces a unique, fragrant scent that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
