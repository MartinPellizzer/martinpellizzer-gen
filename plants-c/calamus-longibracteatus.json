It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, slender rhizome and large, arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a showy, petal-like spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for aquatic and bog gardens."
