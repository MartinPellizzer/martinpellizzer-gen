    "intro": "Caladenia ochreata, commonly known as the ochre spider-orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, intricate flowers that typically display a combination of yellow and brown hues. The plant produces a single, downward-facing flower with a distinctive, elongated labellum that resembles a spider's body. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats, often in regions with a Mediterranean climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
