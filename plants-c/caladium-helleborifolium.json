    "intro": "Caladium helleborifolium, commonly known as the white caladium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically white with red veins, though some varieties exhibit different color patterns. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shady garden beds. Its foliage is the main ornamental feature, as it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are not typically noticeable. Caladium helleborifolium is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and as a houseplant."
