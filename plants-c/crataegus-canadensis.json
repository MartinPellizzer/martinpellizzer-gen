    "intro": "Crataegus canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to elliptic leaves, and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Crataegus canadensis is often found in woodlands, along streambanks, and in disturbed areas, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision."
