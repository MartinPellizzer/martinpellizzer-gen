It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweeds known for their milky sap. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with slender stems and opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and are usually pink or purple, attracting various pollinators. The plant's latex contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
