It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant has been traditionally used in local medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
