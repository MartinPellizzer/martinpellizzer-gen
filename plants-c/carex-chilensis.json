It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Carex chilensis produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in stabilizing soil and supporting wildlife."
