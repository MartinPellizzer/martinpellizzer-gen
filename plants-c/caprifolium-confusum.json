    "intro": "Caprifolium confusum, commonly known as the confused honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that typically bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are edible but often have a sharp, acidic taste. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Caprifolium confusum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife due to its nectar-rich flowers."
