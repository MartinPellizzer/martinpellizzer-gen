    "intro": "Carlina conformis, commonly known as the upright carline thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous roots. The plant features silver-gray leaves with a rough texture and spiny margins, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flower heads consist of blue to purple ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming from late summer to autumn. Carlina conformis is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
