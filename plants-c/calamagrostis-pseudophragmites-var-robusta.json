It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. This plant thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, fluffy flowers that appear in late summer. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
