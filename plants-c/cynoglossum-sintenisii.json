It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high altitudes. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, known for its medicinal and ornamental value. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
