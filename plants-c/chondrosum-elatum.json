    "intro": "Chondrosum elatum, commonly known as the giant rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as broccoli and mustard. The plant is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
