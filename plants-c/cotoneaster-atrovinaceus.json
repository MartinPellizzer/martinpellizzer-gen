    "intro": "Cotoneaster atrovinaceus, commonly known as the dark-leaved cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, dark green leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn, contributing to its ornamental value. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that attract wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in temperate climates."
