    "intro": "Clinopodium frivaldszkyanum, commonly known as the Frivaldszky's mint, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, often emitting a strong mint-like fragrance when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
