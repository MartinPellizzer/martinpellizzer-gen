    "intro": "Cynanchum erectum, commonly known as American milkweed or yellow milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweeds, and is characterized by its opposite leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including humans, and contains cardiac glycosides. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Cynanchum erectum plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
