    "intro": "Cerastium regelii var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Central Asia. It features small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. Its hairy texture helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils."
