    "intro": "Ceratozamia brevifrons, commonly known as the short-beaked cycad, is a perennial plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being larger and more robust than the male ones. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in warm, humid climates. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often appreciated by horticulturists and botanists alike."
