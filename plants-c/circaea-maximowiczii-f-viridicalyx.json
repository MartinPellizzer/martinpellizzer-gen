    "intro": "Circaea maximowiczii f. viridicalyx, commonly known as the green-leaved wood sorrel, is a rare botanical variant characterized by its distinctive dark green, almost metallic sheen leaves. This form of Circaea maximowiczii is native to specific regions of eastern Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant belongs to the Primulaceae family and produces small, white or pink flowers during the spring season. Its unique foliage makes it a sought-after specimen for botanical gardens and plant enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
