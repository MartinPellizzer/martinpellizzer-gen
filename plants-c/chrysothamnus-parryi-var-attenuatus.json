    "intro": "Chrysothamnus parryi var. attenuatus, commonly known as the slender goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow floral heads and silver-green foliage, which are typical features of the Asteraceae family. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. Its narrow, linear leaves and compact growth habit help it conserve water in harsh conditions. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
