    "intro": "Cardamine acris, commonly known as creeping water crowfoot, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks, wet meadows, and woodland floors. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting invertebrates."
