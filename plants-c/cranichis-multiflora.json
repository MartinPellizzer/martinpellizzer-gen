    "intro": "Cranichis multiflora, commonly known as the clustered orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its clustered growth habit and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine forests and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, fragrant blooms during the spring and early summer. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in some regions and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
