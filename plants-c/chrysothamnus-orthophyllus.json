    "intro": "Chrysothamnus orthophyllus, commonly known as the golden sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and silvery-gray foliage, which are adaptations to its arid environment. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The golden sagebrush plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
