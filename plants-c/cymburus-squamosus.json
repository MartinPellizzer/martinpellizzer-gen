    "intro": "Cymburus squamosus, commonly known as the scaly sea hare, is a species of sea slug found in tropical and subtropical marine environments. It belongs to the family Aplysiidae and is characterized by its distinctive, rough, and scaly skin. The plant, though not a true plant, is a mollusk and lacks chlorophyll, relying on algae for sustenance. Its body is typically adorned with a variety of colorful patterns and is often covered in a thick, protective layer of mucus. Cymburus squamosus plays a role in marine ecosystems by grazing on algae and contributing to nutrient cycling."
