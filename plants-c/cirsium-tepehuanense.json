    "intro": "Cirsium tepehuanense, commonly known as the Tepehuan thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico, particularly in the states of Durango and Sinaloa. The plant is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and large, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers, which are typically purple or blue, bloom in the summer months and attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cirsium tepehuanense is considered a rare and endangered species."
