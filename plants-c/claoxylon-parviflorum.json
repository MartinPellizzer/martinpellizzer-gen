    "intro": "Claoxylon parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered claoxylon, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves with alternate arrangement. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
