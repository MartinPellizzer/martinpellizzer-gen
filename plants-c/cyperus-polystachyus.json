    "intro": "Cyperus polystachyus, commonly known as the spike rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and tall, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, clustered flowers. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in wet or marshy environments. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize wetlands effectively. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
