It is characterized by its distinctive blue to purple flowers that resemble a tongue in shape, hence its common name. The plant features rough, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Native to Central and Eastern Europe, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it contributes to biodiversity and supports pollinators."
