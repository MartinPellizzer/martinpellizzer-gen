    "intro": "Canarium nigrum, commonly known as the black nuts or African date tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and lanceolate, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by oval, woody fruits that contain a single seed. The fruit's hard shell encases a sweet, edible kernel, which is the primary commercial product. Canarium nigrum is also valued for its essential oils and has traditional uses in medicine and cuisine."
