    "intro": "Corchorus stenophyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaf dock, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to regions of Eurasia and is characterized by its upright, slender stems and alternate leaves that are typically narrow and lanceolate. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and astringent properties. Corchorus stenophyllus is also valued as a source of fiber in some parts of its native range."
