    "intro": "Colona aequilateralis, commonly known as the equilateral colona, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its triangular leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
