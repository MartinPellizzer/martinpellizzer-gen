    "intro": "Campylospermum auriculatum, commonly known as the silverleaf cypress, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are gray-green in color, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a coastal plant due to its drought tolerance. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in Mediterranean climates."
