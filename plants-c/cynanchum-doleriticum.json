    "intro": "Cynanchum doleriticum, commonly known as the rock milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has fibrous roots that help it survive in dry environments, and its leaves are often covered in fine hairs. It is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a common sight in desert landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
