    "intro": "Chloryllis pratensis, commonly known as the common chloryllis, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the family. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Chloryllis pratensis is an important component of New Zealand's native flora and plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
