    "intro": "Colymbada nicolai, commonly known as the Nicolo's water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, glossy green leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces striking white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow waters and absorbing nutrients from the sediment. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Colymbada nicolai is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
