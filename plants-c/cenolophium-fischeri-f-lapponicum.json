    "intro": "Cenolophium fischeri f. lapponicum, commonly known as the Lapponian bellflower, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cold, moist environments. It has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces its flowers in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
