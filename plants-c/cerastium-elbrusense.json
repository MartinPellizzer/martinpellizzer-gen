It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, white flowers and delicate, hairy leaves. The plant typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense mats close to the ground. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
