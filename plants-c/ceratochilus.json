    "intro": "Ceratochilus, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their unique, helmet-like structures on their flowers. The genus includes several species, many of which are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. They typically have small, intricate flowers with a distinct hooded shape, which is a key identifying feature. Ceratochilus species are often found in forested areas and are adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
