    "intro": "Cyperus koenigii, commonly known as nut sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its triangular, tuberous rhizomes and erect, often hairy stems that bear narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, three-sided spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Nut sedge is known for its rapid growth and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
