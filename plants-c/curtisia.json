    "intro": "Curtisia, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a glossy surface and a distinct venation pattern. Curtisia species are native to tropical regions of Africa and the Caribbean, often growing in moist, shaded environments. They produce small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, capsule-like fruits."
