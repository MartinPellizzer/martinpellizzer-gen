    "intro": "Campium semicordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in wet environments. Campium semicordatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
