    "intro": "Clinelymus yubaridakensis, commonly known as the Yubaridakensis grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and moderate precipitation. Due to its resilience, it is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
