    "intro": "Critoniadelphus nubigenus, commonly known as the cloud-dwelling orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant species found in high-altitude cloud forests. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in humid, misty environments where it clings to tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its unique adaptations allow it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
