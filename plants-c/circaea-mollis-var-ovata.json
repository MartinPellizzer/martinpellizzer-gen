    "intro": "Circaea mollis var. ovata, commonly known as the ovate wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with ovate leaflets and produces small, yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas and has a creeping habit with rhizomatous stems. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The ovate wood sorrel is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate appearance and shade tolerance."
