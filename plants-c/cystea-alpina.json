    "intro": "Cystea alpina, commonly known as the alpine cystea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, woody stems and dense foliage. The plant typically produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late summer. Cystea alpina thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its slow growth and hardy nature make it a resilient component of alpine ecosystems."
