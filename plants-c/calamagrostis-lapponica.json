    "intro": "Calamagrostis lapponica, commonly known as the Arctic grass or Lapland grass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as tundra and wet meadows, often forming dense tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. Calamagrostis lapponica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic organisms."
