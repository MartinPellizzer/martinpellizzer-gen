    "intro": "Carex nanella, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish or reddish flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. Carex nanella prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. It is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
