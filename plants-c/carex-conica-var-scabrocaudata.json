    "intro": "Carex conica var. scabrocaudata, commonly known as the scabrous-tailed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers, typically in late summer to early fall. It prefers moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its unique foliage and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study and ecological restoration projects."
