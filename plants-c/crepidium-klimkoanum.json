    "intro": "Crepidium klimkoanum, commonly known as the Klimko's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in a loose inflorescence. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
