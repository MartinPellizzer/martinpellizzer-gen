    "intro": "Ceratostema rimbachii, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of white or pale blue. The plant has heart-shaped to ovate leaves that are usually hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight, often growing in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its ornamental value and delicate appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
