    "intro": "Cepobaculum canaliculatum, commonly known as the narrow-cupped liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure with closely spaced, ovate leaves that have a distinctive, shallowly notched or canaliculated margin. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including female gametophytes, are borne on specialized leaf-like structures called gemmae. Cepobaculum canaliculatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates in its ecosystem."
