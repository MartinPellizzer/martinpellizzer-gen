    "intro": "Campnosperma schatzii, commonly known as the Schatz's campnosperma, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, followed by woody, spherical fruits. It is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a characteristic component of coastal vegetation. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
