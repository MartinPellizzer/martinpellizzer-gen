    "intro": "Cytisus pindicola, commonly known as the Pindus broom, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Greece, particularly the Pindus Mountains, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it is adapted to withstand harsh, alpine conditions. Cytisus pindicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
