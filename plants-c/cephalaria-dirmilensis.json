It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in dense, spherical clusters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
