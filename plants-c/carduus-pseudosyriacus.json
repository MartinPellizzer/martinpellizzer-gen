    "intro": "Carduus pseudosyriacus, commonly known as the Syrian thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust stem covered in rough, prickly hairs, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a serrated margin. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spiny, globular fruits. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range."
