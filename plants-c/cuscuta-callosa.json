    "intro": "Cuscuta callosa, commonly known as the callosa dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant attaches to its host using specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's tissues to extract water and nutrients. Cuscuta callosa is commonly found on various plants, including agricultural crops and native vegetation. Its rapid growth and parasitic nature make it a significant concern in ecological and agricultural contexts."
