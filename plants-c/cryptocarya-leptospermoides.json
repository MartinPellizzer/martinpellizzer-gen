    "intro": "Cryptocarya leptospermoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cryptocarya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland forest environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. It produces small, dark blue to black berries that are an important food source for native birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
