    "intro": "Campyloneurum wurdackii, commonly known as the Wurdack's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. The plant features whorled leaves that form dense, compact clusters, and it produces cone-like structures called strobili that contain spores. It is characterized by its primitive morphology, which reflects its ancient lineage dating back to the Carboniferous period. Campyloneurum wurdackii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
