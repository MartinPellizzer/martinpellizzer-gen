    "intro": "Cocleorchis sarcoglottidis, commonly known as the sarcoglottis orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and intricate morphology. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small but showy, featuring a complex arrangement of petals and sepals that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
