It features small, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
