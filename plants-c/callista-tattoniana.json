    "intro": "Callista tattoniana, commonly known as the golden lily, is a striking flowering plant native to the eastern regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Callista tattoniana is often found in moist, shaded habitats, including rainforests and creek margins. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for garden cultivation in suitable climates."
