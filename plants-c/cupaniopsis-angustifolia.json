    "intro": "Cupaniopsis angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cupaniopsis, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy plant in coastal environments. Cupaniopsis angustifolia is often used in coastal landscaping due to its resilience and ornamental value."
