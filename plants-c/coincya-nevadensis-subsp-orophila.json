    "intro": "Coincya nevadensis subsp. orophila, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to high-elevation lakes in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant thrives in cold, clear, oligotrophic waters and is often found in rocky, shallow lake beds. Its flowers are tiny and inconspicuous, typically appearing in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health."
