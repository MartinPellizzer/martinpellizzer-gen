It belongs to the Meliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and long, drooping catkins. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as clearings and along roadsides due to its rapid growth rate. Its hollow stems provide shelter for various animals, including birds and insects. Cecropia commutata plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
