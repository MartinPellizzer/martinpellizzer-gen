    "intro": "Callitriche \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid water starwort, is a semi-aquatic plant belonging to the plantain family (Plantaginaceae). It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has small, star-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pale blue or white, and they bloom in clusters near the water's surface. Callitriche \u00d7 hybrida is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
