It features heart-shaped, thick, waxy leaves that are often lobed and have a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in small inflorescences. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-colored capsule that splits open to release seeds. The thick, fleshy leaves are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for arid environments."
