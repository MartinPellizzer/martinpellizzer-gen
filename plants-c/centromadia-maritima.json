It is a low-growing, succulent shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Centromadia maritima plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
