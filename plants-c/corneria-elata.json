It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy inflorescences. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, or purple. It is adapted to dry climates and can thrive with minimal water once established. Corneria elata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
