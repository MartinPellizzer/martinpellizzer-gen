    "intro": "Casuarina preissiana, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like foliage and distinctive cone-like structures. The plant thrives in coastal areas, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It produces small, yellow flowers followed by woody cones that contain edible seeds. Casuarina preissiana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
