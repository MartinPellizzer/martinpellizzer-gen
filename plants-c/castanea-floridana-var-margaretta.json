    "intro": "Castanea floridana var. margaretta, commonly known as the Florida chestnut, is a rare and endangered plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and other chestnut species. The tree produces small, spiny fruits called nuts, which are enclosed in a prickly husk. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, typical of many chestnut species. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
