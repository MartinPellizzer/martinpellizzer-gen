    "intro": "Cordia egyptiaca, commonly known as the Egyptian cordia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soil, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Cordia egyptiaca is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
