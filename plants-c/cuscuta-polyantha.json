    "intro": "Cuscuta polyantha, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found on crops such as beans and sunflowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread widely. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
