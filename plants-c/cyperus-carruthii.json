    "intro": "Cyperus carruthii, commonly known as the swamp spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown to yellowish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Cyperus carruthii thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its adaptability to wet environments makes it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
