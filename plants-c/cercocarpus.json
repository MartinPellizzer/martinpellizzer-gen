    "intro": "Cercocarpus, commonly known as curlleaf mountain-mahogany, is a genus of shrubs native to North America. These plants are characterized by their small, rounded leaves that often curl at the edges, giving them their common name. They typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The flowers are usually yellow and borne in clusters, while the fruit is a woody, three-lobed capsule. Cercocarpus species are valued for their hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils."
