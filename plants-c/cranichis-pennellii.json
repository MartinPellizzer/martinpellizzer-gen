    "intro": "Cranichis pennellii, commonly known as the Pennell's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in its native range."
