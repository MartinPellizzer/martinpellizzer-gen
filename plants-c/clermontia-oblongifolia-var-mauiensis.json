    "intro": "Clermontia oblongifolia var. mauiensis, commonly known as Maui's mountain ginger, is a rare endemic plant native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as rainforest understories and along stream banks. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces fleshy, red or orange berries that are an important food source for native birds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
