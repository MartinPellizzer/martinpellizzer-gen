    "intro": "Cydonia mallardii, commonly known as the wild pear or sand pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellow or green fruits that ripen in late summer, often with a tart, pear-like flavor. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas with mild climates. Cydonia mallardii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
