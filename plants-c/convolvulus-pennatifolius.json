    "intro": "Convolvulus pennatifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves and trumpet-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports and structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and inland regions. The genus Convolvulus includes many species with similar morphological traits, but C. pennatifolius stands out for its distinctive foliage and ornamental value."
