It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. This plant thrives in low-light conditions and is often found in slow-moving freshwater environments. It is popular in aquariums due to its hardy nature and ability to grow in a variety of water conditions. The plant's rhizome system allows it to spread and form dense underwater mats."
