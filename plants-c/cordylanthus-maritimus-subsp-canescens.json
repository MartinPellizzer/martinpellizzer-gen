    "intro": "Cordylanthus maritimus subsp. canescens, commonly known as the saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to coastal areas of California. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and drought conditions. This subspecies plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
