    "intro": "Cytisus capitatus var. prolifer, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a vibrant touch to its foliage. The plant has slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread readily along the ground. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. This variety is well adapted to poor, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats."
