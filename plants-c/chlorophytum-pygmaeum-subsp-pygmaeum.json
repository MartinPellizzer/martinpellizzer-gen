It features dense clusters of bright green, fleshy leaves that form a low-growing rosette. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soil and prefers bright, indirect light. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
