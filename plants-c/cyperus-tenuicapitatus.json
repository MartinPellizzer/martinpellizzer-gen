It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flower heads. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and bear dense clusters of tiny, three-lobed flowers.
