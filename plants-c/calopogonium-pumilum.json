    "intro": "Calopogonium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf velvet bean, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features trifoliate leaves with small, hairy stipules and produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation."
