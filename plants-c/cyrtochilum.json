    "intro": "Cyrtochilum, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a genus of epiphytic and terrestrial orchids native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their unique, helmet-shaped flowers that often have intricate patterns and vibrant colors. Cyrtochilum species typically grow in shaded, humid environments and rely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Their roots are often specialized for absorbing moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, many Cyrtochilum species are threatened with extinction."
