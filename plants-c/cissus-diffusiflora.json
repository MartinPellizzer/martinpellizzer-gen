    "intro": "Cissus diffusiflora, commonly known as the creeping cutleaf gooseberry, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped, leathery leaves that are often pubescent and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. Its stems are succulent and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread easily. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage."
