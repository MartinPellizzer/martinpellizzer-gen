    "intro": "Condylocarpus apulus, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a distinctive member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 5 meters. The plant has a thick, fibrous trunk that stores water, enabling it to survive in its native habitat's variable climate. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Condylocarpus apulus is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's forests."
