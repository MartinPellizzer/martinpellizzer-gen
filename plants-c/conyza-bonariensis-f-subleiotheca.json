    "intro": "Conyza bonariensis f. subleiotheca, commonly known as the woolly cudweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers arranged in clusters. It is native to South America but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environmental conditions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
