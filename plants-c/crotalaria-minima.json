    "intro": "Crotalaria minima, commonly known as the dwarf rattlepod, is a small annual herb native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers and narrow, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its small size and rapid growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
