    "intro": "Claytonia rosulata, commonly known as the \"Snowy Mouse-Ear,\" is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features rosettes of glossy, waxy, white or pale green leaves that resemble mouse ears, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or lavender during the spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Claytonia rosulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
