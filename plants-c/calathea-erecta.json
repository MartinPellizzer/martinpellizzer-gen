    "intro": "Calathea erecta, commonly known as the upright calathea, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns in shades of green, silver, and pink. The plant thrives in humid environments and requires indirect light to flourish. Its foliage is known for its ability to change color in response to light exposure, a phenomenon called nyctinasty. Calathea erecta is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
