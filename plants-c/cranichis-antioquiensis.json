    "intro": "Cranichis antioquiensis, commonly known as the Antioquian orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with a short rhizome and a single, lance-shaped leaf. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat destruction, it is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to survive."
