    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. acutiuscula, commonly known as the sharp-lobed hazel, is a variant of the hazel genus native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, sharply lobed leaves that are often shorter and more pointed than those of the typical hazel. The plant produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk, which are typically harvested in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens and natural habitats. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its ecological benefits to wildlife."
