    "intro": "Comocladia platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaved sea grape, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is a small shrub characterized by its fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically flat and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in intertidal zones and coastal dunes. Due to its salt tolerance and ability to stabilize coastal sands, it plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
