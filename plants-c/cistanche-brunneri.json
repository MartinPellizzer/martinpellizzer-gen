    "intro": "Cistanche brunneri, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks true leaves and roots. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. The plant is characterized by its yellowish-orange stems and small, scale-like structures that allow it to attach to host plants. It derives all its nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. Cistanche brunneri is often found growing on species of Ephedra and other shrubs in its native habitat."
