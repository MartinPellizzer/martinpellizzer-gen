    "intro": "Calamagrostis canescens f. rufescens, commonly known as the red-haired reed, is a flowering grass species native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that often display a reddish or brownish hue, especially in the autumn. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This ornamental grass is valued for its striking color and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
