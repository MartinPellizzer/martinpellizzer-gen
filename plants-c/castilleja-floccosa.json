    "intro": "Castilleja floccosa, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically small, hairy, and arranged in pairs along the stems. Castilleja floccosa thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed sites."
