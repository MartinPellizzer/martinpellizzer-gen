    "intro": "Cassia auricoma, commonly known as golden shower tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and long, pendulous clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, three-lobed pods that contain several flat, kidney-shaped seeds. Cassia auricoma is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions make it a popular choice for landscaping."
