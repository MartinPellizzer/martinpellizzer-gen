    "intro": "Cerastium glomeratum var. robustum, commonly known as the robust mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and its stems are often prostrate or ascending. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in moist habitats."
