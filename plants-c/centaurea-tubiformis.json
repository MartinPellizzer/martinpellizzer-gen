    "intro": "Centaurea tubiformis, commonly known as the tubular centaurea, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that are tubular in shape, which are adapted for pollination by insects. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open fields and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, bract-like leaves around the flower head. Centaurea tubiformis is a perennial species that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
