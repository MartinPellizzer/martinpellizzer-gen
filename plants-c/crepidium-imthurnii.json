    "intro": "Crepidium imthurnii, commonly known as the Hainan orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to China. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a slender rhizome and a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces a single, elongated flower spike with a single, greenish-yellow flower that has three sepals and three petals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild."
