    "intro": "Cuscuta attenuata, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a tangled, vine-like appearance with slender, thread-like stems. The plant attaches to its host using haustoria, which penetrate the host's tissues to extract water and nutrients. It is found in various parts of the world and can infest a wide range of agricultural and wild plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is often considered a weed."
