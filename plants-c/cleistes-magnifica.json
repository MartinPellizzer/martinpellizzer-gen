    "intro": "Cleistes magnifica, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Americas, is a rare and striking member of the Oncophoraceae family. It is native to the humid lowland forests of Central and South America, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its large, showy, white to pale yellow flowers that resemble those of the true lotus, though it is not closely related. Its unique floral structure includes a hooded calyx that protects the reproductive organs, and it produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cleistes magnifica is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
