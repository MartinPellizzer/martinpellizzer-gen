    "intro": "Calamus latifolius var. marmoratus, commonly known as the marbled arrowroot or marbled calamus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines, and is characterized by its striking, mottled leaves with a marbled pattern of green and white. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a common feature among arum family members. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their starchy roots, which are used in traditional cuisine and medicine. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats."
