    "intro": "Calceolaria oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved slipper orchid, is a herbaceous plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive calyx-like petals that resemble small slippers, which are typically bright red or orange in color. The plant features opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Calceolaria oppositifolia is valued both for its unique appearance and its role in local ecosystems."
