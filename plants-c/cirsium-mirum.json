    "intro": "Cirsium mirum, commonly known as the purple thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and showy purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage is covered in fine, bristly hairs, which contribute to its rugged appearance. Cirsium mirum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
