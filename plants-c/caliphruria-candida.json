    "intro": "Caliphruria candida, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Caliphruria candida is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it thrives in full sun."
