    "intro": "Cirsium decurrens, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and gradually narrow to a point, while its stems are often sprawling or prostrate. Cirsium decurrens plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
