    "intro": "Cyathea bipinnata, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, trunk-like stem and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of compound leaves that are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Cyathea bipinnata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various forest organisms."
