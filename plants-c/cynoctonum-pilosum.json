    "intro": "Cynoctonum pilosum, commonly known as the silky nightshade, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellow, berry-like fruits. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates."
