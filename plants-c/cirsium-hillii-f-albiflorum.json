    "intro": "Cirsium hillii f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered thistle, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and showy, white to pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
