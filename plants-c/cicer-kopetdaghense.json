    "intro": "Cicer kopetdaghense, commonly known as Kopetdagh vetch, is a rare legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, which are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
