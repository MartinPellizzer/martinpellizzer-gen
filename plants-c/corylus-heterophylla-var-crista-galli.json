    "intro": "Corylus heterophylla var. crista-galli, commonly known as the spiked hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its unique, palmately lobed leaves that often have a wavy or serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish male catkins and female flowers that develop into edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and distinctive floral structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats."
