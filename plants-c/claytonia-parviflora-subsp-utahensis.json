    "intro": "Claytonia parviflora subsp. utahensis, commonly known as the Utah spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features rosettes of fleshy, oval leaves covered in a fine white coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open meadows and forested areas. Its botanical structure is adapted to survive in cold, dry climates, making it a characteristic species of high-elevation ecosystems."
