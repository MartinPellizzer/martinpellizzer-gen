    "intro": "Clematis heracleifolia var. maxima, commonly known as the giant clematis, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features large, showy flowers that range from white to deep blue, with a distinctive hooded shape. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a noxious weed in some regions."
