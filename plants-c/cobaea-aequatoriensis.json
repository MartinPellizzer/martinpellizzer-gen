    "intro": "Cobaea aequatoriensis, commonly known as the Amazonian morning glory, is a striking flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant is a climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and produces vibrant purple or blue flowers that open in the early morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Cobaea aequatoriensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a relative of the common morning glory."
