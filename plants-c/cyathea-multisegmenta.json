    "intro": "Cyathea multisegmenta, commonly known as the multi-segmented tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with the trunk forming multiple segments that contribute to its distinctive appearance. Its fronds are typically arranged in a compact rosette at the top of the trunk, and the plant can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Cyathea multisegmenta is often found in moist, shaded environments such as tropical rainforests."
