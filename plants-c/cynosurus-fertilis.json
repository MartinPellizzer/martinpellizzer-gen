    "intro": "Cynosurus fertilis, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Cynosurus fertilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
