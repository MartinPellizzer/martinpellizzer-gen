    "intro": "Carex hansenii, commonly known as Hansen's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and other grass-like plants. This plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads known as spikes. Carex hansenii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse ecosystems."
