    "intro": "Carex longirostris var. microcystis, commonly known as the small-cysted sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and spike-like inflorescences. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flower clusters compared to other Carex species."
