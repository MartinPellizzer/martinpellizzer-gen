    "intro": "Camptoloma villosa, commonly known as the woolly camptoloma, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, or villosa, stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Camptoloma villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
