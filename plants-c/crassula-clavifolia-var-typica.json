It features compact, rosette-shaped foliage with fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its ornamental appeal and ease of care, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
