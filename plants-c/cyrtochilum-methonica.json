    "intro": "Cyrtochilum methonica, commonly known as the Methonic orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a distinctive lip. Cyrtochilum methonica thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
