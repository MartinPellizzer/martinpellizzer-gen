    "intro": "Coleus comosus, commonly known as the curly dock, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, umbrella-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wetlands. Coleus comosus is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it both a common weed and a resilient plant in various environments."
