    "intro": "Conandron ramondioides f. leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered form of the Chinese evergreen, is a rare foliage plant native to southern China. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which are not the primary ornamental feature. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant. Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is less commonly found in commercial horticulture."
