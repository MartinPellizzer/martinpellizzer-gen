    "intro": "Callitriche aquatica var. verna, commonly known as early water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has whorled leaves that are usually submerged, with small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. It is characterized by its delicate, floating stems and its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. This species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
