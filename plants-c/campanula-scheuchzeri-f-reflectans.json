    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri f. reflectans, commonly known as the reflected bellflower, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that help it conserve moisture in its harsh, high-altitude environment. Its habitat is typically found in rocky crevices and meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
