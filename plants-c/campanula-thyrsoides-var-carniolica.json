    "intro": "Campanula thyrsoides var. carniolica, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or meadow habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements."
