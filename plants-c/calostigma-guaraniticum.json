It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
