    "intro": "Cordia collococa, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils, making it well adapted to mangrove ecosystems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries containing numerous seeds. Its root system includes pneumatophores, which help in gas exchange in submerged soil. Cordia collococa plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal areas and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
