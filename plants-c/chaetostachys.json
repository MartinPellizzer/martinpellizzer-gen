    "intro": "Chaetostachys, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are characterized by their slender, often hairy stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. They are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist or wetland habitats. Chaetostachys species are generally herbaceous, with narrow leaves and produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants."
