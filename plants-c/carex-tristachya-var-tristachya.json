It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly curved, with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
