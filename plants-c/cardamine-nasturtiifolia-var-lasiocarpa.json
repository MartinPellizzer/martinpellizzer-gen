    "intro": "Cardamine nasturtiifolia var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the hairy watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its stems are often reddish and slightly hairy, contributing to its rugged appearance. It is valued for its peppery flavor and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
