    "intro": "Cucullaria excelsa, commonly known as the tall bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pale blue or violet, with five petals that curve backward, giving the appearance of a hood. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly rough texture, often with a hairy surface. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that contains several small, black seeds."
