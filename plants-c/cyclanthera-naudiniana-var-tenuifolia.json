It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, pale green fruits that are typically bitter in taste. Its botanical characteristics include a robust root system and tendrils that aid in climbing. This variety is often cultivated for its edible fruits, though it requires careful handling due to its bitterness."
