    "intro": "Coreopsis repens, commonly known as the creeping coreopsis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across open areas. Its lance-shaped leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Coreopsis repens thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower borders."
