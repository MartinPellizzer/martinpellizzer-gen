    "intro": "Cymboglossum zamboangense, commonly known as the Zamboanga cymboglossum, is a rare flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful spathe and spadix inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a glossy surface that reflects light. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
