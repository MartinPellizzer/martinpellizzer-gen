    "intro": "Caleana dixonii, commonly known as the Dixon's spider orchid, is a striking terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern region of Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like floral structure, which features a long, slender column and a distinctive, hooded labellum. The plant typically grows in open, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and grassy areas. Caleana dixonii is a perennial herb with a fibrous root system and slender, grass-like leaves. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
