    "intro": "Cydonia cydonia lusus pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid-shaped quince, is a rare and cultivated variant of the common quince. It is characterized by its distinctive pyramidal growth habit and pale green, fuzzy leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by oval, yellowish-green fruits. The fruit ripens in late autumn and has a sweet, aromatic flavor when fully mature. It is primarily grown for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and is not widely used for culinary purposes."
