    "intro": "Cochlianthus, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower that resembles a ghostly face, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink and bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Cochlianthus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
