    "intro": "Celastrus variabilis, commonly known as the variable staffviolet, is a climbing vine native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments. Botanically, it is notable for its morphological variability, which contributes to its common name."
