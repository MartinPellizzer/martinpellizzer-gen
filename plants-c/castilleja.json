    "intro": "Castilleja, commonly known as the Indian paintbrush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orobanchaceae. These hemiparasitic plants rely on the roots of other plants for some of their nutrients, making them partial parasites. They are characterized by their showy, often bright-red or orange flowers that resemble paintbrushes. Castilleja species are native to North America, particularly the western and southwestern United States, and parts of Canada. Their unique appearance and ecological role make them an interesting subject in both botany and horticulture."
