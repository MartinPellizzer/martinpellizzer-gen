    "intro": "Cavaleriella cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf lily, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often a vibrant green with a slight sheen. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, recurved shape, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, providing ornamental value in both garden and natural settings. Cavaleriella cordata is often grown for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively low maintenance once established."
