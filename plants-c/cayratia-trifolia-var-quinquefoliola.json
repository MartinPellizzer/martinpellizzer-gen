    "intro": "Cayratia trifolia var. quinquefoliola, commonly known as the five-leafed cayratia, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are usually divided into three leaflets, though the varietal form quinquefoliola features five leaflets instead. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its stems are slender and twining, allowing it to climb and spread across supports. It thrives in humid environments and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks."
