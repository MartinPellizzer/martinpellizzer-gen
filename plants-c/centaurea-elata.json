    "intro": "Centaurea elata, commonly known as the tall knapweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and vibrant blue to purple flower heads. The plant typically grows up to 1.5 meters tall, with narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, and bloom from late spring to early autumn. Centaurea elata is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
