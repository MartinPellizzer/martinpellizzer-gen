    "intro": "Cheirisanthera coccinea, commonly known as the red-flowered bell orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and a unique, bell-shaped flower structure that resembles a small lantern. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understorey of tropical forests. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
