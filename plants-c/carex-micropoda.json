    "intro": "Carex micropoda, commonly known as the small-fruited sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense stands, which can stabilize soil in wetland environments. Carex micropoda is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
