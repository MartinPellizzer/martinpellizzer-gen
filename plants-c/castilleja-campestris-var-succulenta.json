    "intro": "Castilleja campestris var. succulenta, commonly known as the plains milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are usually erect and somewhat succulent. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides."
