    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 lucienianum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens. It is characterized by its distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or white with a yellow or green throat, and it produces a single, showy bloom per stem. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
