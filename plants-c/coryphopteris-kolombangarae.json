    "intro": "Coryphopteris kolombangarae, commonly known as the Kolombangara hakea, is a unique fern native to the island of Kolombangara in the South Pacific. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing capsules, are small and clustered, typical of its family. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
