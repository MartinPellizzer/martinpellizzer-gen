It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale blue, appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, showy bracts that resemble petals, which can be mistaken for flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along streambanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for pollinators."
