    "intro": "Cynanchum pilosum, commonly known as the silky milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. Its leaves are opposite and often have a velvety texture, while its roots are fibrous and can persist through harsh environmental conditions. Cynanchum pilosum thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
