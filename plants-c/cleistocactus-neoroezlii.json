    "intro": "Cleistocactus neoroezlii, commonly known as the \"Cerro de la Muerte\" or \"Death Mountain cactus,\" is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, a unique trait among cacti. Its stems are cylindrical and covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in dry gardens and rockeries."
