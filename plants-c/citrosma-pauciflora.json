    "intro": "Citrosma pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered citrosma, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. Its fruit is a small, yellowish berry that contains a single seed, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
