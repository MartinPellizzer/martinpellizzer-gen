    "intro": "Crocus vernus var. lineellus, commonly known as the purple crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It produces delicate, early spring blooms with violet-colored petals and a yellow center. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a symbol of the arrival of spring. The variety is distinguished by its slightly elongated petals compared to the typical crocus vernus."
