    "intro": "Columnea macrophylla, commonly known as the giant flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red or orange flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has glossy, dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea macrophylla is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract hummingbirds and other pollinators."
