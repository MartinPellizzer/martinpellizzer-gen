    "intro": "Clerodendrum robustum var. robustum, commonly known as the giant flame bush, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its clusters of showy, tubular red flowers that bloom throughout the warmer months. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
