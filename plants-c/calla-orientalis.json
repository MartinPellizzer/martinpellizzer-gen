    "intro": "Calla orientalis, commonly known as the oriental calla, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, white spatheal flowers that resemble calla lilies, though it is a distinct species. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
