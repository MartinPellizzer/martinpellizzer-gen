    "intro": "Carex macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, well-drained soils. Carex macrocarpa is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
