    "intro": "Cynorkis purpurea, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Cynorkis purpurea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or warm climates."
