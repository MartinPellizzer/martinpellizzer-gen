    "intro": "Caucalis gracilis subsp. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to shaded woodland areas. It features slender, creeping stems with small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves and flowers are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reflect light in low-light conditions. This subspecies is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or along the edges of shaded gardens."
