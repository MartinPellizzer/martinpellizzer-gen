    "intro": "Caraxeron vermicularis, commonly known as the creeping fern, is a unique plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant's fronds are typically divided into smaller, finger-like segments, giving it a feathery appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures on the underside of its leaves. Due to its preference for specific habitats, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in certain regions."
