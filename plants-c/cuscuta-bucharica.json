    "intro": "Cuscuta bucharica, commonly known as the sand-flower or dwarf dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition. It is characterized by its yellow-orange color and slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and relies on wind for pollination. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in Central Asia and the Middle East. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host plants, making it a potential agricultural concern."
