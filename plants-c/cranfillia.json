    "intro": "Cranfillia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the sunlight, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant's unique morphology includes a short, upright stem with clusters of small, white blooms that emit a faint, sweet fragrance at night. Cranfillia thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices or among dense vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
