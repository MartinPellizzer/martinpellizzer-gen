    "intro": "Camissonia munzii, commonly known as the Munz's camissonia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family. This annual herb typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant produces small, clustered white or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment."
