    "intro": "Chamaecytisus cassius, commonly known as the Portuguese broom, is a flowering shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming a low-growing, mat-like structure. Its leaves are small, leathery, and arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal and rocky garden settings."
