    "intro": "Cassia phyllodinea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cassia, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are narrow and elongated, often with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by pods containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Cassia phyllodinea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
