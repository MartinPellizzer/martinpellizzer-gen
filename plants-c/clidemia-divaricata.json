The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Clidemia divaricata is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it a potential invasive species in certain areas."
