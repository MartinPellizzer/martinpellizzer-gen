    "intro": "Circaea minutula, commonly known as the small white sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open habitats such as dunes, heathlands, and disturbed areas. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. Circaea minutula is adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience."
