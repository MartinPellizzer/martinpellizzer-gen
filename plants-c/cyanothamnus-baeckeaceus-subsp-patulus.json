    "intro": "Cyanothamnus baeckeaceus subsp. patulus, commonly known as the coastal bluebush, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Australia. It features dense clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to spring. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. This subspecies is often used in coastal landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
