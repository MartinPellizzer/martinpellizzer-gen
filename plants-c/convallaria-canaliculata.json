    "intro": "Convallaria canaliculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lily of the valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to western and central Europe. It features slender, arching stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly notched. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. Its flowers are followed by dark blue to black berries, which contain the toxic seeds. This species is typically found in woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
