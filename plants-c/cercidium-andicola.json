    "intro": "Cercidium andicola, commonly known as the desert honey mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by long, slender pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are typically small and feathery, reducing water loss through transpiration. Cercidium andicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat and food for desert wildlife."
