The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by bright red or orange berries. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Croton grosseri is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and resilience to drought."
