    "intro": "Cynodon parviglumis, commonly known as coastal Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense turf and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its spread along shorelines."
