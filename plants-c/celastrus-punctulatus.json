    "intro": "Celastrus punctulatus, commonly known as the spotted satin vine, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with elliptical leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring. The plant bears orange to red berries that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its stems are often covered in small, raised dots, giving it a distinctive appearance. Celastrus punctulatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in diverse soil conditions."
