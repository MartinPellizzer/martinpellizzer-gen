    "intro": "Cimicifuga foetida var. intermedia, commonly known as black cohosh, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features tall, unbranched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are followed by red berries. Its roots and rhizomes are the primary parts used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
