    "intro": "Clutia meyeriana, commonly known as the velvetleaf or African velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Africa, particularly found in countries like Nigeria and Ghana. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
