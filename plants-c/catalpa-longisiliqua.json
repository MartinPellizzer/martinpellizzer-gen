    "intro": "Catalpa longisiliqua, commonly known as the Chinese catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The tree produces long, slender seed pods that split open to release its cottony seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its botanical features make it easily distinguishable from other catalpa species."
