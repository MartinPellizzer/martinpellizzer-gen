    "intro": "Calyptranthes lozanoi subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the tomentose calyptranthes, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the cloud forests of western Ecuador, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted geographic distribution."
