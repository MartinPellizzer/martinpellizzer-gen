    "intro": "Chamaecytisus lindemannii, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features woody stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in pairs along the stems. Chamaecytisus lindemannii is well adapted to rocky and coastal environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
