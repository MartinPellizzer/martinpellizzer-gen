    "intro": "Critonia magistri, commonly known as the sacred orchid, is a rare and exotic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, violet-blue petals and intricate, spurred lip. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions rich in organic matter. Its blooming season occurs during the late spring to early summer, producing fragrant flowers that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is considered a protected species in several South American countries."
