    "intro": "Cheilanthes sieberi subsp. pseudovellea, commonly known as the golden lip fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces spore-bearing structures called soruses on the undersides of its fronds. This subspecies is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in dry, open habitats."
