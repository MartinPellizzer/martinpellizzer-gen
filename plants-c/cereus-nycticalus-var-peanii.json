    "intro": "Cereus nycticalus var. peanii, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a flowering cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its swollen, bulbous stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, night-blooming flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often opening after sunset. Its varietal form, peanii, is distinguished by its unique coloration and growth patterns. Due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
