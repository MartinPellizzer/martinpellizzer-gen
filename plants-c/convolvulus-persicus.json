    "intro": "Convolvulus persicus, commonly known as Persian bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is a sprawling annual or perennial herb that produces small, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant has hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry, rocky habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both a weed and a decorative plant in gardens."
