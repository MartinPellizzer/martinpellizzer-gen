    "intro": "Cynoglottis chetikiana subsp. chetikiana, commonly known as the Chetikian cynoglottis, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions in southern Africa. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, preferring well-drained environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that aids in reducing water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts."
