    "intro": "Chaetocyperus subarticulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and rice fields. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively. It is often found in association with other wetland plants and plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
