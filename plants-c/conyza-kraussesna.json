    "intro": "[WRONG START] Conyza kraussii, commonly known as the common cudweed. It is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Africa, characterized by its hairy stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Conyza kraussii is often considered a weed but plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a food source for some insects."
