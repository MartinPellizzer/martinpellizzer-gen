    "intro": "Croton ortegae, commonly known as the Ortegae croton, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, colorful leaves that display a range of hues including red, orange, and yellow, making it a visually appealing plant. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant due to its vibrant foliage."
