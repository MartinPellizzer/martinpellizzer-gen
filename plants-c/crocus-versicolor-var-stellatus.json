It features distinctive, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a bluish tinge. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing delicate, nodding flowers that are highly ornamental. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge after the flowers have faded."
