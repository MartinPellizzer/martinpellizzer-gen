    "intro": "Calamus floribundus, commonly known as the flowering calamus, is a tropical plant belonging to the Arecaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom during the warm seasons. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Calamus floribundus is often found in swampy or wetland habitats, where it thrives in high humidity and moist soil conditions."
