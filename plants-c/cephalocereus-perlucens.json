    "intro": "Cephalocereus perlucens, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive swollen, rounded stem that resembles a head, giving it its common name. The plant features a dense covering of white to pale green spines, which help protect it from herbivores and excessive sunlight. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or white, blooming at night, which is a common trait among many cactus species. The plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
