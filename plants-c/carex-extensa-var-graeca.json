    "intro": "Carex extensa var. graeca, commonly known as the Greek broadleaf sedge, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-green leaves that form dense, clump-like growths. The plant produces spikes of small, usually green or brownish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
