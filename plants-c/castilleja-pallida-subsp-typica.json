    "intro": "Castilleja pallida subsp. typica, commonly known as the pale castilleja, is a hemiparasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It is native to the western United States and grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. The plant has distinctive red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, and it relies on other plants for some of its nutrients. Castilleja pallida subsp. typica is often found in association with shrubs and grasses, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
