    "intro": "Cichorium spinosum, commonly known as prickly lettuce, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant grows up to 1 meter tall and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its leaves are edible, though they have a bitter taste, and the plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The seeds are also used as a coffee substitute in some cultures."
