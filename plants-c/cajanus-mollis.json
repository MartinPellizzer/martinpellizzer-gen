    "intro": "Cajanus mollis, commonly known as the slender cowpea, is a herbaceous annual legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated pods containing several seeds. Cajanus mollis is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in crop rotation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for forage or as a green manure."
