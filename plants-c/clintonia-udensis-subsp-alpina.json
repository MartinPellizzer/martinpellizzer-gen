It typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats at high elevations. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale yellow. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
