    "intro": "Celastrus quadrangularis, commonly known as the Indian star gooseberry, is a climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems with four angular ridges, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a rough texture. Celastrus quadrangularis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
