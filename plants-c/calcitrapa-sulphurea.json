    "intro": "Calcitrapa sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh conditions. Calcitrapa sulphurea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
