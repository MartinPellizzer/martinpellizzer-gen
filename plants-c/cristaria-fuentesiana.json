    "intro": "Cristaria fuentesiana, commonly known as the Fuentesian starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its star-shaped, violet-blue petals and its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing clusters of small, delicate flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine, silvery down. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cristaria fuentesiana is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
