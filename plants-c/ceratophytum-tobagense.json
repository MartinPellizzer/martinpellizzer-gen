    "intro": "Ceratophytum tobagense, commonly known as the Toba prickly pear, is a succulent plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, paddle-shaped stems that store water. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the dry season, which are followed by edible fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions with its deep root system. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in tropical and subtropical regions."
