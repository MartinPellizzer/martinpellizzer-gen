    "intro": "Cheirolophus sempervirens, commonly known as the evergreen bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking blue to purple bell-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stems. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in well-drained, rocky soils, making it well-suited to arid environments. The plant is also noted for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, including drought and poor soil, due to its deep root system and waxy leaf coating."
