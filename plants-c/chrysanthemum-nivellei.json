    "intro": "Chrysanthemum nivellei, commonly known as the snow chrysanthemum, is a herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine collections."
