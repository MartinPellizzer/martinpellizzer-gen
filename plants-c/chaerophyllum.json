    "intro": "Chaerophyllum, commonly known as hogweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and tall, hollow stems that often have a purple or greenish hue. The flowers are typically small and clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences, a feature common to many members of the carrot family. Chaerophyllum species are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and some are cultivated for their ornamental value. However, certain species can be toxic and should be handled with care."
