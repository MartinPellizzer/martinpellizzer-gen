    "intro": "Cestrum tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, are dark blue when mature and contain seeds that can germinate readily under suitable conditions. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its unique nocturnal blooming habit."
