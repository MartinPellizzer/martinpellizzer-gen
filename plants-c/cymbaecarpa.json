    "intro": "Cymbaecarpa, commonly known as the starfruit or carambola, is a tropical fruit-bearing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive five-pointed star shape when sliced, which is formed by its elongated, ribbed fruit. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a glossy surface. The fruit is typically harvested when it turns a vibrant yellow or orange, indicating maturity."
