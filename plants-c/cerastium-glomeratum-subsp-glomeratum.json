    "intro": "Cerastium glomeratum subsp. glomeratum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a mat-forming growth habit, often carpeting rocky or disturbed ground. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds by wind."
