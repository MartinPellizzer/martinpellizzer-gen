    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a genus of evergreen trees in the family Fagaceae. These plants are native to Southeast Asia, particularly China, India, and the Philippines. They are characterized by their hard, dense wood and broad, leathery leaves. Cyclobalanopsis species produce acorns that are often enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature of the genus. They play an important role in forest ecosystems and are valued for their durable timber."
