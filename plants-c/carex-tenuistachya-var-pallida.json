    "intro": "Carex tenuistachya var. pallida, commonly known as the pale sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. The pale coloration of its inflorescence distinguishes it from other carex species."
