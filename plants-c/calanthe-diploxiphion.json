    "intro": "Calanthe diploxiphion, commonly known as the two-lipped calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it thrives in well-drained, humus-rich soils. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, feature a unique two-lipped structure with intricate patterns and vibrant colors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calanthe diploxiphion is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
