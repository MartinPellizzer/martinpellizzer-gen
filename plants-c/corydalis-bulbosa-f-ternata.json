    "intro": "Corydalis bulbosa f. ternata, commonly known as the three-leaved corydalis, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, spurred flowers that bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces bulbous tubers underground, which serve as storage organs and help it survive in harsh environmental conditions. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves, with three distinct leaflets, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soils."
