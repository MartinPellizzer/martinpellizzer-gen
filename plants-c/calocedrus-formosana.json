It belongs to the cypress family (Cupressaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves and reddish-brown bark. The tree typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and cool, moist climates. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
