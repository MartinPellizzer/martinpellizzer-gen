    "intro": "Chrysosplenium rimosum subsp. rimosum, commonly known as the creeping chrysosplenium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features dense, mat-forming growth with small, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on short pedicels. Its foliage is characterized by a distinctive bluish-green hue and a rough texture due to the presence of fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks."
