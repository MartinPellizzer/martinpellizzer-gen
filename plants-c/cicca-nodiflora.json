    "intro": "Cicca nodiflora, commonly known as the clustered cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and dense rosette of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Native to parts of Southeast Asia, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
