It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Clidemia nervosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
