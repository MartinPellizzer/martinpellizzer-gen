    "intro": "Connellia caricifolia, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves that are often hairy and adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its root system is fibrous, helping it stabilize in waterlogged conditions. Connellia caricifolia plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
