    "intro": "Carex tomentosa var. lucana, commonly known as the woolly sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with a soft, hairy texture on the leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-ranked spikes, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
