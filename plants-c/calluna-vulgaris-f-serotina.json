    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris f. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering heather, is a variant of the common heather. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom later in the season, often in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland habitats. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
