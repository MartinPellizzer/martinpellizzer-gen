    "intro": "Centranthera prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate centranthera, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its prostrate or creeping growth habit, with small, clustered leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. It is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
