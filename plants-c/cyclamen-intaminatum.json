    "intro": "Cyclamen intaminatum, commonly known as the Persian cyclamen, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Caucasus. It is a perennial herb characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety foliage and striking, bowl-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink, white, and red. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and thrives in partial shade, making it well-suited for woodland gardens. Its tuberous roots allow it to survive harsh winter conditions, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Cyclamen intaminatum is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
