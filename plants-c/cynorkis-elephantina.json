    "intro": "Cynorkis elephantina, commonly known as the giant African snail, is a large, herbivorous mollusk native to Africa. It belongs to the family Achatinidae and is characterized by its thick, spiral-shaped shell and soft, fleshy body. The plant-like appearance of its shell gives it a deceptive resemblance to certain flowering plants. While not a true plant, it plays a significant ecological role in its native habitats. Due to its rapid reproduction and potential to become invasive, it is often considered a pest in non-native regions."
