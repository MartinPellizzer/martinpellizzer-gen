    "intro": "Cerasus sachalinensis, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or sakura, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its ornamental white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the emergence of leaves. The plant produces small, sweet fruits known as cherries, which are edible and used in culinary applications. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated edge, and the bark is smooth and grayish-brown. Cerasus sachalinensis is widely cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and as a symbol of renewal and the changing seasons."
