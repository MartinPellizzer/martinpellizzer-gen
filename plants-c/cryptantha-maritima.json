    "intro": "Cryptantha maritima, commonly known as the saltbush or sea saltbush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the western United States. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub with small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common species in coastal dunes and salt marshes. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cryptantha maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native insects and birds."
