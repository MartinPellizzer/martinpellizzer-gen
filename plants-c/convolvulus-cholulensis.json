    "intro": "Convolvulus cholulensis, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, funnel-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing along roadsides and in disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it both a popular garden plant and a potential weed."
