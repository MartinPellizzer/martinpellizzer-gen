    "intro": "Centaurea alpigena, commonly known as the alpine knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with ray florets that are longer than the tubular florets. Centaurea alpigena is often found in rocky or grassy slopes, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
