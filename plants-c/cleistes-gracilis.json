    "intro": "Cleistes gracilis, commonly known as the slender cleistocarp, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Oenotheraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that remain closed during the day. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that open only at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Cleistes gracilis typically grows in moist, shaded habitats like woodlands and wetlands. Its unique floral structure and pollination strategy make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
