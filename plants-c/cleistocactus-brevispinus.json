    "intro": "Cleistocactus brevispinus, commonly known as the short-spined apple cactus, is a species native to northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a short, thick stem covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces vibrant orange flowers during the summer months, which are typically hidden within the spines, a feature known as cleistogamy. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid gardens."
