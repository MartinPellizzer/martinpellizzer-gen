    "intro": "Carex divisa var. ammophila, commonly known as the sand sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal and sandy environments. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize sand dunes and its tolerance to salt and wind."
