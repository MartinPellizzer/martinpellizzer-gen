    "intro": "Calamagrostis ligulata, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. Calamagrostis ligulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in wetland ecosystems."
