    "intro": "Carex flava var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf yellow sedge, is a low-growing, clump-forming perennial plant native to moist to wet habitats in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright yellow to golden green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires consistently moist soil conditions. Carex flava var. pumila is often used in wetland restoration projects and as a ornamental plant in water gardens."
