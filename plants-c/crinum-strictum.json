    "intro": "Crinum strictum, commonly known as the narrowleaf glory lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features tall, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its bulbs are fleshy and serve as storage organs, allowing the plant to survive dry periods. Crinum strictum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
