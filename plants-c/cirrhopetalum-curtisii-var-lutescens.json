    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum curtisii var. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered cirrhopetalum, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family. It is characterized by its elongated, pendant flowers that display a vibrant yellow coloration, which is particularly notable in its varietal form. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, providing a lush green backdrop to its showy blooms. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
