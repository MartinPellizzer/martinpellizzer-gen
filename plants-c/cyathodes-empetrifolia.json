    "intro": "Cyathodes empetrifolia, commonly known as the rock pear, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the genus. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Cyathodes empetrifolia is also notable for its edible fruits, which are small and resemble pears in shape."
