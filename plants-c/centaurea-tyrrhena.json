    "intro": "Centaurea tyrrhena, commonly known as the Tyrrhenian cornflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bright blue to purple flowers and spiny leaves, which are typical of the genus Centaurea. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. It produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across its natural range. Centaurea tyrrhena is often found in coastal areas and is a common sight in Mediterranean landscapes."
