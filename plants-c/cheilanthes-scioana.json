    "intro": "Cheilanthes scioana, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial plant that thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions. The plant has a compact, upright growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine, fuzzy hairs. Its reproductive structures are typically found on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Cheilanthes scioana is well-suited to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
