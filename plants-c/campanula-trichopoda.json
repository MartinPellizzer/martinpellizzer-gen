    "intro": "Campanula trichopoda, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Campanula trichopoda is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
