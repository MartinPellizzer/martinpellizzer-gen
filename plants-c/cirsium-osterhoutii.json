    "intro": "Cirsium osterhoutii, commonly known as Osterhout's thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Nevada, where it grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It is a perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 1 to 3 feet, with a sturdy stem covered in bristly hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
