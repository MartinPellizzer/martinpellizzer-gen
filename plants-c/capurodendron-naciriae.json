    "intro": "Capurodendron naciriae, commonly known as the Moroccan ebony, is a rare and endemic species native to the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces black, hard wood that is highly valued for its density and durability. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat degradation, it is considered a vulnerable species."
