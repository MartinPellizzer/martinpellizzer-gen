    "intro": "Cistus feredjensis, commonly known as the Algerian rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Algeria. It belongs to the Heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Its leaves are covered in fine, glandular hairs that secrete essential oils, contributing to its strong fragrance. Cistus feredjensis is also valued for its ecological role in preventing soil erosion and supporting local biodiversity."
