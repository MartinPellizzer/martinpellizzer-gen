    "intro": "Cowania plicata, commonly known as the pleated cowania, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are pleated or folded, giving it a unique, architectural appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its slow growth rate and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for collectors and landscape designers."
