    "intro": "Cipura paludosa, commonly known as the marsh cipura, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in South America. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cipura paludosa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic insects and small vertebrates."
