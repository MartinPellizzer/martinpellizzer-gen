    "intro": "Cardamine glaphyropoda var. crenata, commonly known as the rounded water crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its basal leaves that are typically divided into three parts, with the lower lobes being rounded or heart-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a loose inflorescence, often appearing in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats."
