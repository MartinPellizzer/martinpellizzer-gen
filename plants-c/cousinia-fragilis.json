    "intro": "Cousinia fragilis, commonly known as the fragile cushion flower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of silver-gray foliage and produces showy, pink to purple flowers in the summer. The plant is adapted to harsh, arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Cousinia fragilis is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
