    "intro": "Caesalpinia oleosperma, commonly known as the oil-rich thorn tree, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often bipinnate, and its distinctive yellow-orange flowers that resemble those of other Caesalpinia species. The plant produces hard, woody pods containing oily seeds, which are a key feature of its botanical classification. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
