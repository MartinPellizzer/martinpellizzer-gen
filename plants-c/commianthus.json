It is characterized by its striking, waxy, silver-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. It produces small, white flowers that are often followed by bright red berries. Commianthus is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
