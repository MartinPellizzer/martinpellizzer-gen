    "intro": "Cycnoches versicolor, commonly known as the variable water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water. Cycnoches versicolor plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
