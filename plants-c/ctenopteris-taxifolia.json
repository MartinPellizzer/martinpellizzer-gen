    "intro": "Ctenopteris taxifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forest floors. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas gradually. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
