    "intro": "Calotis scabiosifolia var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly calotis, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its foliage is covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. This variant is notable for its unique morphology and adaptation to harsh environmental conditions."
