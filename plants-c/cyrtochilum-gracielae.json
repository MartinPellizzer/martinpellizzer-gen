    "intro": "Cyrtochilum gracielae, commonly known as the Grace's slipper orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pouch-like flower structure, which is typical of the Cypripediaceae subfamily. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are usually small, fragrant, and display a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyrtochilum gracielae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
