    "intro": "Calamus viminalis var. fasciculatus, commonly known as the clustered reed, is a variant of the common calamus found in wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, fascicled growth habit, where the stems grow in compact clusters. The plant produces long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and basketry. It thrives in marshy areas and is adapted to waterlogged soils. Its rhizomatous structure allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands in its native habitat."
