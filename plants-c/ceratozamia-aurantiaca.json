    "intro": "Ceratozamia aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being a striking orange hue, which gives it its common name. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful conservation efforts."
