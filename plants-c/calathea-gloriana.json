    "intro": "Calathea gloriana, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage with intricate patterns and contrasting leaf colors. The plant's leaves are known to fold upward at night, a phenomenon called nyctinasty, which is a response to changes in light and temperature. Calathea gloriana prefers bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
