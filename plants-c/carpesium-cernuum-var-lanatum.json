It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow composite flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration efforts."
