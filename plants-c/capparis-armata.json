    "intro": "Capparis armata, commonly known as the rock caper, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure and thorny stems, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in terminal umbels, followed by edible, greenish fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and typically have a rough, hairy texture. Capparis armata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
