    "intro": "Ctenopteris solida, commonly known as the hardy water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are dark green and often have a waxy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies. Ctenopteris solida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in water gardens and as a houseplant."
