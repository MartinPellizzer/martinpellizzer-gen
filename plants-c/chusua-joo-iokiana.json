The plant is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves with serrated edges, and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale yellow. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
