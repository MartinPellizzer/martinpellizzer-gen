    "intro": "Cactus crebrispinus, commonly known as the dense spiny cactus, is a species native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684 spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny exterior. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb moisture from light rains. Cactus crebrispinus is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
