    "intro": "Castilleja cryptandra, commonly known as the narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and relies on host plants for some of its nutrients. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it typically grows in dry, open habitats. Castilleja cryptandra plays a role in pollination and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
