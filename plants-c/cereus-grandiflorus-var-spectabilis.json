    "intro": "Cereus grandiflorus var. spectabilis, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night and emit a sweet fragrance. These flowers typically bloom only once a year, usually during the warmer months. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and scientific study."
