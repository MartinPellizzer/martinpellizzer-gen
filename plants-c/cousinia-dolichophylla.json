    "intro": "Cousinia dolichophylla, commonly known as the long-leaf cushion flower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushions of foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems and water-storing tissues. Cousinia dolichophylla is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
