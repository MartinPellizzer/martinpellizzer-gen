    "intro": "Claytonia serpenticola, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy, basal leaves that form a rosette and grows in moist, shaded environments. It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is known for its unique, ghost-like appearance. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
