    "intro": "Coffea cymosa, commonly known as the white coffee plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Ethiopia, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces red berries containing seeds that are used to make a mild, aromatic coffee. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its caffeine-containing seeds. Due to its unique appearance and mild flavor, it is a less common but intriguing coffee species."
