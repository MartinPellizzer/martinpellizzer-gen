    "intro": "Ctenopteris staheliana, commonly known as the Stahel's sea holly, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Ctenopteris staheliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
