    "intro": "Cactus sulcatus, commonly known as the zigzag cactus, is a species native to the deserts of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed stems that form a zigzag pattern, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, typically blooming at night. It is adapted to arid environments with a deep root system for water absorption. Its spines provide protection from herbivores and help shade the stem to minimize evaporation."
