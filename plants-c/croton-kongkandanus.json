    "intro": "Croton kongkandanus, commonly known as the Klang croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored leaves that can range from green to red, orange, or yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its ornamental value is its most notable feature."
