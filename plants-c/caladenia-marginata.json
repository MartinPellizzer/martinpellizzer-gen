    "intro": "Caladenia marginata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed spider-orchid, is a striking orchid native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, intricate flower with a distinctive, spider-like appearance. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, usually between July and September. Caladenia marginata is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
