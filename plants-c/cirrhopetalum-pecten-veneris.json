    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum pecten-veneris, commonly known as the Venus's comb or Venus's feather, is a striking flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, feathery inflorescence that resembles the hair of the goddess Venus. The plant produces showy, pale pink or white flowers that are clustered in a sweeping, comb-like arrangement. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. Cirrhopetalum pecten-veneris is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a rare example of a tropical orchid adapted to a subtropical climate."
