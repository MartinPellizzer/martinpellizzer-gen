    "intro": "Catasetum discolor f. genuinum, commonly known as the pale orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking pale yellow to white flowers, which often have a subtle greenish tinge. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers emit a faint, sweet scent that attracts specific pollinators, such as bees and wasps. The plant's botanical features make it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts and botanists alike."
