    "intro": "Corunastylis exigua, commonly known as the small-stemmed corunastylis, is a member of the family Myrtaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant native to Australia, typically found in heathlands and sandy soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. Its flowers are pale green to white, with four petals and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is often overlooked due to its modest size but plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
