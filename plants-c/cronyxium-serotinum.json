It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white. It blooms late in the growing season, typically from September to November, which gives it its common name. Cronyxium serotinum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and stream banks."
