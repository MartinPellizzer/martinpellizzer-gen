    "intro": "Cotoneaster elatus, commonly known as the shining cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on top. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant autumn foliage and persistent berries, making it a popular choice for landscaping."
