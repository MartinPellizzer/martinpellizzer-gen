    "intro": "Cleome trollii, commonly known as the desert spiderflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, spider-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Cleome trollii is often found growing in sandy or gravelly soils along dry streambeds and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and low-water gardening practices."
