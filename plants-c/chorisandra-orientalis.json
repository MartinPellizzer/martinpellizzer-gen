    "intro": "Chorisandra orientalis, commonly known as the Chinese hibiscus, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the warmer months. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Chorisandra orientalis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
