    "intro": "Cardamine pedata, commonly known as water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, freshwater environments. It features floating leaves that are heart-shaped and often have a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its roots form dense mats on the waterbed, helping to stabilize the substrate. Cardamine pedata is often found in ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams across temperate regions."
