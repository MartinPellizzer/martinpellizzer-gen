    "intro": "Cestrum polyanthum, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its clusters of fragrant, white flowers that open at night and emit a strong, sweet scent. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces yellow or orange berries that are edible but can be toxic in large quantities. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The flowers are pollinated primarily by moths and bats, making it an important plant in nocturnal ecosystems."
