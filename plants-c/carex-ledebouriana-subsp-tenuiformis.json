It typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in cold environments."
