    "intro": "Carex tentaculata var. parvula, commonly known as the small-leaf sedges, is a variety of sedge characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
