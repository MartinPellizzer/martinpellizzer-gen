    "intro": "Cardamine leucantha var. koreana, commonly known as Korean watercress, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring. This variety is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to that of watercress."
