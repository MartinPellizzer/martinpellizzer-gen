    "intro": "Cereus grandiflorus var. affinis, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cacti species native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night and remain open for only a few days. These flowers are typically borne at the apex of the stem and are adapted for pollination by moths and bats. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
