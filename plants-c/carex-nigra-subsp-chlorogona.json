It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. This subspecies is typically found in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability."
