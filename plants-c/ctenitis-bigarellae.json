    "intro": "Ctenitis bigarellae, commonly known as the spotted tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive pattern of light and dark green on its fronds, which gives it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The fronds are compound, with a unique arrangement of pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
