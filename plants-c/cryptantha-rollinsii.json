    "intro": "Cryptantha rollinsii, commonly known as the Rollins' cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has small, hairy leaves and produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
