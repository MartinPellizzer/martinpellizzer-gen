    "intro": "Cheilanthes daenikeri, commonly known as the Daeniker's rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or crevice environments, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has a short, upright rhizome with densely packed, lance-shaped fronds that are usually covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. Its sporangia are clustered in groups called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
