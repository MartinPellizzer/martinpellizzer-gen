    "intro": "Carex oederi var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bog sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous brown flowers in early summer, which are arranged in spikelets along the stem. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its compact size and ability to stabilize soil, it is a valuable plant for wetland restoration projects."
