    "intro": "Cerinthodes oblongifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf cerinthodes, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its oblong, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
