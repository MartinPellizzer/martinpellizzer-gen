    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 meyeri, commonly known as the Meyer lemon. It is a hybrid citrus fruit resulting from the cross between a lemon (Citrus limon) and a mandarin (Citrus reticulata). The plant is a small evergreen tree with glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. Its fruit is typically smaller than a regular lemon, with a thin, yellow-orange rind and a sweet, less acidic flavor. The Meyer lemon is widely cultivated for both its ornamental value and its edible fruit, often used in cooking and baking."
