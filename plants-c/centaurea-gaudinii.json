    "intro": "Centaurea gaudinii, commonly known as the Gaudin's cornflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its flowers are bright blue or purple, with prominent yellow centers, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Centaurea gaudinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soils."
