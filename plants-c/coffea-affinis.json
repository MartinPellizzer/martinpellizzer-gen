    "intro": "Coffea affinis, commonly known as the African coffee plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain two seeds, which are used to make coffee. It is often cultivated for its potential in coffee production, though it is less commonly used than other Coffea species. The plant prefers well-drained soil and a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
