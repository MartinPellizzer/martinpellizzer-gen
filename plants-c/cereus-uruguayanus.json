    "intro": "Cereus uruguayanus, commonly known as the Uruguay candleplant, is a species of cactus native to Uruguay and southern Brazil. It is a tall, spiny plant that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with a columnar stem and clusters of white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening only for a few hours, and it produces small, red fruits that are edible. The plant is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates."
