    "intro": "Catapodium hemipoa, commonly known as the narrowleaf catapodium, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It typically grows in low, dense tufts, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to survive in harsh conditions, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
