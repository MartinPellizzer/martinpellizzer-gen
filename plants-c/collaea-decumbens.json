    "intro": "Collaea decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate rock daisy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Australia. It features a sprawling, mat-forming growth habit with stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. Collaea decumbens is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun and well-drained environments."
