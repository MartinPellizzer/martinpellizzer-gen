    "intro": "Carduus \u00d7 meratii, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant that results from the cross between Carduus marianus and Carduus nutans. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has been introduced to other regions and is sometimes considered an invasive species due to its rapid spread and ability to thrive in various environments. Botanically, it is notable for its complex hybrid origin and adaptability to different ecological conditions."
