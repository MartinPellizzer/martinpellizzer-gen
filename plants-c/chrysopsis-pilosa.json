    "intro": "Chrysopsis pilosa, commonly known as the hairy goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and grass-like foliage. The plant is distinguished by its soft, hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Chrysopsis pilosa is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
