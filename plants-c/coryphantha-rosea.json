    "intro": "Coryphantha rosea, commonly known as the roseate cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Coryphantha rosea is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
