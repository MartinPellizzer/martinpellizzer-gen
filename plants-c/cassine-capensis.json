    "intro": "Cassine capensis, commonly known as the Natal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow or orange center. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Cassine capensis is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and adaptability."
