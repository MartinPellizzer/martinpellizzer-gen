    "intro": "Campanula pusilla var. pinguis, commonly known as the fat bellflower, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to violet in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and alpine tundra. Due to its ornamental value and delicate appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
