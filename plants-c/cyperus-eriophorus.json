    "intro": "Cyperus eriophorus, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage. Cyperus eriophorus is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems."
