    "intro": "Calystegia sepium var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese morning glory, is a climbing vine native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to pale purple. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and riverbanks. Its rapid growth and showy blooms make it a popular ornamental plant, though it can be invasive in some regions. The seeds are enclosed in a tough, spiny capsule that splits open when mature."
