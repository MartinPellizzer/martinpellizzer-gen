    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. apetala, commonly known as the hairyside watercress, is a variant of the hairy watercress species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are often used in traditional cuisines for their peppery flavor, and it is valued for its nutritional content. The apetala variant is distinguished by the absence of petals in its flowers, a unique floral morphology."
