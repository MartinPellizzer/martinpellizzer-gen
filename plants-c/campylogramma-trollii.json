    "intro": "Campylogramma trollii, commonly known as the dwarf rock fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. The plant has a compact growth habit with finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its sporangia are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Campylogramma trollii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in bog gardens or as a houseplant."
