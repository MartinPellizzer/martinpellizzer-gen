It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It has narrow, linear leaves and forms dense clumps, making it a useful plant for erosion control. The species is relatively low maintenance and thrives in partial to full sun."
