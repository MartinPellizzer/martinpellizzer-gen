    "intro": "Cypripedium calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive slipper-shaped flower, which is typically pink or white with a yellow lip. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas. It has a short, stocky rhizome and produces a single, showy flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
