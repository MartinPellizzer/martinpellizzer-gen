    "intro": "Caladenia exilis subsp. vanleeuwenii, commonly known as the slender spider-orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spider-like flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. The plant produces a single, narrow leaf and blooms during the autumn season. It thrives in sandy soils and requires specific environmental conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
