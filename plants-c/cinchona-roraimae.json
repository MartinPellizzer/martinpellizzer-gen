It is native to the tepuis of South America, particularly in Venezuela and Guyana. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties, as it contains quinine, a compound used in the treatment of malaria. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes. Its leaves and bark are the primary sources of the alkaloids that make it valuable in pharmacology."
