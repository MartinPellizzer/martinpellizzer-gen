    "intro": "Coelogyne anceps, commonly known as the white-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow pseudobulbs and linear, dark green leaves. The plant produces strikingly fragrant, white flowers with a distinctive red lip, which bloom in summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Coelogyne anceps is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
