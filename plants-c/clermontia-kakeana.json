    "intro": "Clermontia kakeana, commonly known as Kamehameha's candle, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found exclusively in Hawaii. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of mesic forests, often near stream banks or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a velvety texture, while its stems are slender and somewhat succulent. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Clermontia kakeana is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
