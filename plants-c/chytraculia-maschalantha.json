    "intro": "Chytraculia maschalantha, commonly known as the Malayan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique floral structure that resembles a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it requires a humid, shaded environment to thrive. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
