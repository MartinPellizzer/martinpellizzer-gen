    "intro": "Calanthe rhodochila var. reconditiflora, commonly known as the rare red-flowered calanthe, is a subtropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and showy, crimson or reddish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its flowers are borne on short, upright inflorescences and are often adorned with intricate patterns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
