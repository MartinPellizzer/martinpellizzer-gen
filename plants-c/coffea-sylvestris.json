    "intro": "Coffea sylvestris, commonly known as wild coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries containing seeds that are used to make coffee. It is often found in shaded, humid environments and is considered a wild relative of cultivated coffee species. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest for breeding programs aimed at improving coffee resilience."
