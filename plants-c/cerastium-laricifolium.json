    "intro": "Cerastium laricifolium, commonly known as the mountain chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, opposite leaves that are often described as resembling the leaves of a fir tree, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is often found in meadows and forest edges. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
