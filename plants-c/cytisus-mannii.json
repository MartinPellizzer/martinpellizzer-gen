It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes and bloom during the warmer months. The plant has slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and semi-arid environments. Cytisus mannii plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
