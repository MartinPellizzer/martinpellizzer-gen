    "intro": "Chrysanthemum djilgense, commonly known as the Djilgense chrysanthemum, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated in xeriscaping and native gardens."
