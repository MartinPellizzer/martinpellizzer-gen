    "intro": "Cornopteris banajaoensis, commonly known as the Banao fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely toothed margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Cornopteris banajaoensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution in its native habitat."
