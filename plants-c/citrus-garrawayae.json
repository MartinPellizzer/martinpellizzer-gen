    "intro": "Citrus garrawayae, commonly known as the Garraway's lime, is a rare and ancient citrus species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its small, green, oval-shaped fruits that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces fragrant white flowers and has dark green, glossy leaves with a slightly serrated edge. Its fruit is often used in traditional Indigenous Australian medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Citrus garrawayae is considered endangered and is of significant botanical and ecological interest."
