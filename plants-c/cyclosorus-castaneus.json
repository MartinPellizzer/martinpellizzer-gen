    "intro": "Cyclosorus castaneus, commonly known as the chestnut fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces dense clusters of fan-shaped fronds with a dark green, leathery texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a circular pattern. Cyclosorus castaneus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
