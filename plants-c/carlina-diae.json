    "intro": "Carlina diae, commonly known as the alpine carline thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. The plant features a rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its purple-blue flowers appear in late summer, forming a compact cluster at the center of the plant. Carlina diae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
