    "intro": "Cumulopuntia, commonly known as the cloud cactus, is a genus of cacti native to the Americas, particularly Mexico and the southwestern United States. These plants are characterized by their tall, columnar stems that often branch out into a tree-like structure. The leaves are typically reduced to spines, and the stems are covered in dense, white or grayish hairs that help reduce water loss. Cumulopuntia species produce vibrant flowers, often in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom during the warmer months. They are adapted to arid environments and require well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
