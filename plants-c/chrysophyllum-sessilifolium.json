    "intro": "Chrysophyllum sessilifolium, commonly known as the little-leaf star-apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to West Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack stalks. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to round, sweet-smelling fruits with a smooth, yellowish skin. The fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, white pulp, and it is often consumed fresh or used in traditional remedies."
