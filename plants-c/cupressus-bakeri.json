    "intro": "Cupressus bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's cypress, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage and slender, columnar growth habit. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with moderate rainfall. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
