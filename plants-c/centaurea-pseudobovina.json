    "intro": "Centaurea pseudobovina, commonly known as the false bull's-thorn, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. The plant features spiny, bract-like leaves and produces bright yellow to orange flower heads that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its inflorescence is composed of ray florets surrounded by a series of disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Centaurea pseudobovina is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
