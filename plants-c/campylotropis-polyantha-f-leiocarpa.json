    "intro": "Campylotropis polyantha f. leiocarpa, commonly known as the silky-leaved cowpea, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, silky-textured leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant is native to regions of East Asia, including China, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, oval legumes that contain edible seeds, though the plant is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value. The variety f. leiocarpa is distinguished by its particularly soft and hairy foliage, which sets it apart from other forms of Campylotropis."
