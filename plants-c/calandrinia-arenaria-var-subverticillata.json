    "intro": "Calandrinia arenaria var. subverticillata, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This species is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
