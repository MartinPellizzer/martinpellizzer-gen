It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, triangular seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. This variety is valued for its edible leaves, which are rich in nutrients and used in traditional cuisines."
