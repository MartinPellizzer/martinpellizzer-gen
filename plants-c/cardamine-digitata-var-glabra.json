    "intro": "Cardamine digitata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth water-cress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a peppery aroma, and its small white flowers are borne in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which are often used in salads or as a garnish."
