    "intro": "Calla virginica, commonly known as the swamp pink, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, white spatheae that enclose the small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions. Its leaves are arrow-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Calla virginica plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
