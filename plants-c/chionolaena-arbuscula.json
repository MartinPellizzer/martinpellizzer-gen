It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features soft, silvery-gray leaves with a fuzzy texture, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, yellow, and borne in clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. The plant is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
