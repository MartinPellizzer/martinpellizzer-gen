    "intro": "Cryptocarya tomentosa, commonly known as the silky cryptocarya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a dense, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and are usually white or pale yellow, attracting various pollinators. The fruit is a small, dark purple drupe that develops from the flower and is an important food source for native wildlife."
