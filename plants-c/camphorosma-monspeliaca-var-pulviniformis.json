    "intro": "Camphorosma monspeliaca var. pulviniformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf camphorosma, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic environments and it is of interest in ecological and horticultural studies."
