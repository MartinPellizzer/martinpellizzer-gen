    "intro": "Convolvulus mexicanus, commonly known as Mexican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with helical stems that twine around supports. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, opening in the morning and closing at dusk. Its leaves are heart-shaped and slightly hairy, while its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered an invasive weed in certain regions."
