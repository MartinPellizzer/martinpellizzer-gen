    "intro": "Cambessedesia arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Cambessedesia arenaria plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
