It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. Cracca tenella is often used in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
