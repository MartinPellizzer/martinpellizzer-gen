    "intro": "Carex aquatilis subsp. hyperborea, commonly known as the Arctic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes, often found in the Arctic and subarctic zones. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various Arctic flora and fauna."
