    "intro": "Cupressus coulteri, commonly known as the Coulter pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and scaly, dark green foliage. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing resistance to fire and drought. The Coulter pine is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
