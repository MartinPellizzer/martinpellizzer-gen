    "intro": "Camissonia boothii subsp. alyssoides, commonly known as the alpine alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, hairy stems and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in high-altitude ecosystems."
