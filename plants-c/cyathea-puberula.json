    "intro": "Cyathea puberula, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a distinctive hairy texture on its young fronds, which gives it its common name. Cyathea puberula thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of ferns."
