    "intro": "Castilleja fruticosa, commonly known as redstem Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients, often growing on grasses and shrubs. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria to connect with the roots of its host. Castilleja fruticosa is an important component of native plant communities and is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological value."
