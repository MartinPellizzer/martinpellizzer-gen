    "intro": "Convolvulus valentinus, commonly known as Valentine's morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces spiral-shaped seed pods that contain small, dark seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing as an annual in temperate climates. Its name is derived from its blooming period around Valentine's Day, though it may flower earlier depending on the region."
