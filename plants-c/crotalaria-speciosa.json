    "intro": "Crotalaria speciosa, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It features a slender, branching stem covered in small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has palmate leaves with three to five leaflets, and its root system is characterized by a distinctive taproot. It is often found in disturbed soils and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia. The plant is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its role in promoting soil stability and supporting pollinator populations."
