    "intro": "Corispermum macrospermum, commonly known as the giant bladderwort, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline and brackish environments. It is characterized by its submerged, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures called pneumatophores, which aid in gas exchange. The plant produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous minute seeds. It is typically found in coastal areas, marshes, and other wetlands with high salt content. Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in challenging, waterlogged conditions."
