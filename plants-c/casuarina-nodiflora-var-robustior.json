    "intro": "Casuarina nodiflora var. robustior, commonly known as the robust casuarina, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage composed of tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it resilient to salt and wind. Its root system helps stabilize dunes and prevent erosion in coastal environments."
