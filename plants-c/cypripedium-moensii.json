    "intro": "Cypripedium moensii, commonly known as the Sichuan lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple with a pouch-like lip. The plant has a pseudobulb structure and produces a single, large flower per stem, which blooms in late spring. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with moist, well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cypripedium moensii is critically endangered and protected in its native range."
