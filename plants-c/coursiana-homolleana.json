    "intro": "Coursiana homolleana, commonly known as the West Indian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its valuable timber, it has been heavily exploited, leading to its classification as an endangered species in many regions."
