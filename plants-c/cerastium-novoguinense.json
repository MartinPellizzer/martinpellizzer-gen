    "intro": "Cerastium novoguinense, commonly known as the New Zealand chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. Cerastium novoguinense is often found in damp, shaded areas such as forests and stream banks."
