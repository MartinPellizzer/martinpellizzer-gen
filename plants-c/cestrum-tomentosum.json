    "intro": "Cestrum tomentosum, commonly known as the wooly cestrum, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems covered in a dense, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with a velvety texture. The wooly cestrum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
