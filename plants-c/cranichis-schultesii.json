It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and grasslands. It has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
