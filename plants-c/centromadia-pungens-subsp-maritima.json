    "intro": "Centromadia pungens subsp. maritima, commonly known as the coastal centromadia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its arid and salty environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines. Its resilience to salt spray and wind makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
