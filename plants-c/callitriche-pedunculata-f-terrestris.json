    "intro": "Callitriche pedunculata f. terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial callitriche, is a low-growing aquatic or semi-aquatic plant characterized by its small, floating or submersed leaves. It typically features whorled arrangements of narrow, linear leaves that are often less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are usually borne on short pedicels, and it is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. It is a member of the Hydrocharitaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich environments. This variety is distinguished by its terrestrial growth habit compared to its more aquatic relatives."
