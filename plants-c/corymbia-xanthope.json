    "intro": "Corymbia xanthope, commonly known as the yellow bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey to yellowish bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which bloom from September to November. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Corymbia xanthope is well adapted to harsh climates and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience."
