    "intro": "Cymbalaria alpina, commonly known as the alpine stormweed, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cymbalaria alpina is often found in meadows, slopes, and along paths in high-altitude environments."
