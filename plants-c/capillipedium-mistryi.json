    "intro": "Capillipedium mistryi, commonly known as the Mistry's capillary moss, is a rare and specialized member of the moss family. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like structures that form dense, carpet-like growths on rocky substrates. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with elongated, branching filaments that contribute to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high moisture levels. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Capillipedium mistryi is considered a conservation concern."
