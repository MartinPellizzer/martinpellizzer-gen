    "intro": "Coronilla compressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved crownvetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
