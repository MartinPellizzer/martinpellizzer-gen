    "intro": "Cathestecum varium, commonly known as the variable cathestecum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species with unique botanical characteristics. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and specialized floral structures. The plant typically features alternate, lanceolate leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that aids in water retention. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, a common trait in the Euphorbiaceae family. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, often dispersed by wind or animals."
