    "intro": "Cuscuta urceolata, commonly known as the yellow dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is often found growing on grasses, herbs, and other low-growing plants. Its seeds are tiny and can remain viable in the soil for many years. Cuscuta urceolata is native to North America and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
