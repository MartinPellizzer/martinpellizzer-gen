    "intro": "Clidemia fenestrata, commonly known as the windowleaf or fenestrated mallow, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves with irregularly shaped holes or fenestrations, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, and usually have five petals with a distinctive purple or pink coloration. Clidemia fenestrata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage."
