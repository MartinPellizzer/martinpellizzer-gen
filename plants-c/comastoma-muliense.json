    "intro": "Comastoma muliense, commonly known as the Muliense bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat preferences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it can thrive in moist conditions. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise above the water surface. Comastoma muliense plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling."
