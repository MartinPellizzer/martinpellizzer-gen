    "intro": "Cenchrus albertsonii, commonly known as the Albertson's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
