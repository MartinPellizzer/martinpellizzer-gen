    "intro": "Cissus sessilis, commonly known as the rock fig or African iceplant, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its stems are often armed with spines, which can deter herbivores. Cissus sessilis is commonly used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
