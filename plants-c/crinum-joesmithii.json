It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and often persist through the winter, providing structural interest. Crinum joesmithii is well-suited for rock gardens or containers due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value."
