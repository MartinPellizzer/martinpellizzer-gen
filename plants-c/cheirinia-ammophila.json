    "intro": "Cheirinia ammophila, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to sandy soils in Mediterranean regions. It has creeping rhizomes and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant's leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open grasslands. Cheirinia ammophila plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and is sometimes considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
