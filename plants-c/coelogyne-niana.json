    "intro": "Coelogyne niana, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow flowers with a distinctive red throat and green sepals. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its flowers typically bloom during the late winter to early spring, adding a vibrant touch to gardens and greenhouses. Coelogyne niana is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance in traditional medicine."
