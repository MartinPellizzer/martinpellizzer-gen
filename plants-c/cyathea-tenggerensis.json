    "intro": "Cyathea tenggerensis, commonly known as the Tengger Pitcher Fern, is a species of tree fern native to Indonesia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing both spores and seeds, which is uncommon among ferns. Its fronds are typically green and can grow up to several meters in length, contributing to its striking appearance. Cyathea tenggerensis thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
