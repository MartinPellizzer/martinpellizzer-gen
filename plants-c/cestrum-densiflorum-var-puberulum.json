It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by moths and bats, and it produces small, red berries that are edible for some wildlife. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and nocturnal fragrance."
