It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and rosettes of rounded, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in cold-climate habitats."
