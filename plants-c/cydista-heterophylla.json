    "intro": "Cydista heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf cydista, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant exhibits heterophylly, a phenomenon where leaves vary in shape and size depending on their position on the stem. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped or ovate, with a hairy surface, and it produces small, white to greenish flowers in umbels. Cydista heterophylla thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woods and along stream banks."
