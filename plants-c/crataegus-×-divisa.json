    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 divisa, commonly known as the hybrid hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Crataegus monogyna (common hawthorn) and Crataegus laevigata (smooth hawthorn), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins, and the plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring. Its fruit is a red, fleshy pome that ripens in late summer, often persisting on the plant through winter. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in gardens and landscapes."
