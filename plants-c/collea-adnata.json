    "intro": "Collea adnata, commonly known as the red-flowered rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open woodlands or along stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, red or pinkish-red flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence is a spike of elongated, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Collea adnata is adapted to moist, well-drained environments and is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
