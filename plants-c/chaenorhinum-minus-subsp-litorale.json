    "intro": "Chaenorhinum minus subsp. litorale, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its saline environment. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for coastal gardens. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion in coastal ecosystems."
