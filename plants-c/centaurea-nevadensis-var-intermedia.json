    "intro": "Centaurea nevadensis var. intermedia, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and slender, branching stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in high-elevation environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat."
