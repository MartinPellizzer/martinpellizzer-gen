    "intro": "Crotalaria stenorhampha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its seed pods are cylindrical and dehiscent, releasing seeds when mature, contributing to its spread in suitable environments. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
