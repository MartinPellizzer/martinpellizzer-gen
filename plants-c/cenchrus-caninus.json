    "intro": "Cenchrus caninus, commonly known as the sand ratgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its coarse, wiry leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, pale-colored florets. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can outcompete other vegetation. Cenchrus caninus is often used in erosion control due to its rapid establishment and hardy nature."
