    "intro": "Codarium, commonly known as the \"garden orchid\" or \"Chinese evergreen,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers, which are often surrounded by a showy spathe. Codarium species are typically grown as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. They require well-draining soil and moderate watering to prevent root rot."
