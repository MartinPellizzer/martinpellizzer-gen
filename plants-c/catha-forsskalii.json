    "intro": "Catha forsskalii, commonly known as khat, is a flowering plant native to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of East Africa. It is a shrub that can grow up to 2 meters tall, characterized by its small, pale green leaves and clusters of yellowish-white flowers. The plant contains psychoactive alkaloids, particularly cathinone and cathine, which are responsible for its stimulant effects. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often found in coastal regions with well-drained soil. The plant has been used traditionally for its stimulating properties and is culturally significant in several regions."
