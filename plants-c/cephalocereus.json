    "intro": "Cephalocereus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a genus of cacti native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their tall, columnar stems and are often covered in spines. They are known for their striking, large flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or yellow. The flowers are pollinated by nocturnal insects and bats, making them an important part of the ecosystem. Cephalocereus species are popular in horticulture due to their unique appearance and long blooming period."
