    "intro": "Cardamine konaensis, commonly known as Kona buttercup, is a rare herbaceous plant native to the island of Hawaii. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forested areas on the island. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
