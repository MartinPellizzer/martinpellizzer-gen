    "intro": "Coleosanthus laciniatus, commonly known as the lace fern, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its intricate, finely divided fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant features a creeping rhizome with erect, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive. The fronds can grow up to several feet in length, adding a dramatic visual effect in shaded garden settings."
