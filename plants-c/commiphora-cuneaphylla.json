    "intro": "Commiphora cuneaphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf myrrh, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its aromatic resins, which have been used traditionally for medicinal and incense purposes. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with simple, alternate leaves that are often lanceolate in shape. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces a yellowish to reddish resin that exudes from specialized structures called gum glands."
