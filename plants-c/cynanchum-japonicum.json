    "intro": "Cynanchum japonicum, commonly known as Japanese milkweed or Japanese dogbane, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbellate clusters, which bloom in summer. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. It is often found in moist woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
