    "intro": "Ceranthus, commonly known as the flame violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often violet or purple flowers that bloom in spring. Ceranthus species typically have hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture. They are native to Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in woodland or grassy areas. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to their ecological importance."
