    "intro": "Ciconium crenatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, often appearing in the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in aquatic environments. Ciconium crenatum plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
