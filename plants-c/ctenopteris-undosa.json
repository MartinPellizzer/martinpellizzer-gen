    "intro": "Ctenopteris undosa, commonly known as the ribbon fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow fronds that are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to several meters."
