    "intro": "Cissus aphyllantha, commonly known as the leafless cissus, is a unique succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its green stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, red berries. It thrives in arid environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in dry woodlands. Due to its unusual appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for xerophytic gardens."
