    "intro": "Carduus lappaceus, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features upright, hairy stems and basal leaves that are lobed and covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Carduus lappaceus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
