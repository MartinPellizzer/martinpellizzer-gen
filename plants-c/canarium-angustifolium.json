    "intro": "Canarium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved candlenut, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody, oval-shaped fruits containing a single seed. The bark is smooth and grayish, and the tree can grow up to 20 meters tall. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its oil-rich seeds and medicinal properties."
