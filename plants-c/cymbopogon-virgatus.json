    "intro": "Cymbopogon virgatus, commonly known as silver grass, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its fine, silvery-blue foliage and slender, upright growth habit. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered along the stems. Silver grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
