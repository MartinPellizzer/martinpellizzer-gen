    "intro": "Cracca brachystachya, commonly known as the dwarf cracca, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
