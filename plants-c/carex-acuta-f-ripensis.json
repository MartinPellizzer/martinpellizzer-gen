    "intro": "Carex acuta f. ripensis, commonly known as the riparian sedge, is a variant of the narrow-leaved sedge. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as along riverbanks and in marshy areas. Its leaves are narrow, sword-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
