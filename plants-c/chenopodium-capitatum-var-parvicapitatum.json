    "intro": "Chenopodium capitatum var. parvicapitatum, commonly known as dwarf goosefoot, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, clustered inflorescences and has alternate, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow and are borne in dense, compact clusters. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some traditional herbal remedies."
