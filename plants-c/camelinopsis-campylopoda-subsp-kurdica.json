    "intro": "Camelinopsis campylopoda subsp. kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish camelinopsis, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Kurdistan. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
