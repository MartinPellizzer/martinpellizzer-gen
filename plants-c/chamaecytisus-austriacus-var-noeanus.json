It features slender, woody stems covered in dense, soft, grayish-green foliage. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it suitable for alpine gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
