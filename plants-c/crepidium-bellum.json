    "intro": "Crepidium bellum, commonly known as the bell orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often epiphytic on trees or rocks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, elongated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Crepidium bellum is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
