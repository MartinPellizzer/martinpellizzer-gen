    "intro": "Cinclidocarpus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae. It is characterized by its hard, dense wood and evergreen foliage, with leaves typically narrow and leathery. The flowers are usually small and clustered, often in inflorescences that are either racemose or cymose in structure. These plants are native to southern Africa and are adapted to nutrient-poor soils, often found in coastal or mountainous regions. They play an important ecological role in their native habitats, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
