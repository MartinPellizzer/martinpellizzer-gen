    "intro": "Capriola tenella, commonly known as the small rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant has small, basal leaves that are oval to lance-shaped, and it produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Capriola tenella is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
