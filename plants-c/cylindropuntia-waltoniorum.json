    "intro": "Cylindropuntia waltoniorum, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
