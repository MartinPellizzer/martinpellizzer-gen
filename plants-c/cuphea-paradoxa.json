    "intro": "Cuphea paradoxa, commonly known as the flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it an attractive addition to ornamental landscapes."
