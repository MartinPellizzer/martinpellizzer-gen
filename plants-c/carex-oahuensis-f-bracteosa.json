    "intro": "Carex oahuensis f. bracteosa, commonly known as the bracteose sedge, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and specialized reproductive structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as stream banks and forest understories. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets with bracts that are distinctive in shape and arrangement. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
