    "intro": "Clematis microphylla var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western miniature clematis, is a compact, deciduous vine native to the western United States. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically less than an inch in length, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a climbing plant. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often used in small garden spaces where space is limited."
