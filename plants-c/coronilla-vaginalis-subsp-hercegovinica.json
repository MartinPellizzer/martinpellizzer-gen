It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
