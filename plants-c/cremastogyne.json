    "intro": "Cremastogyne, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a delicate, leafless stem and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, it is considered a vulnerable species."
