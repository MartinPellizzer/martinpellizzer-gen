    "intro": "Carex crawei var. heterostachya, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions, often found in meadows and along streambanks. The plant has grass-like leaves that are narrow and cylindrical, with a dense, spike-like inflorescence that bears small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in gardens with proper moisture conditions."
