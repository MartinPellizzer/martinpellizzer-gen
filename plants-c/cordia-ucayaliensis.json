    "intro": "Cordia ucayaliensis, commonly known as the Amazonian wax tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in humid environments. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Cordia ucayaliensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
