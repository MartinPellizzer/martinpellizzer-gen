    "intro": "Corallodiscus grandis, commonly known as the giant coral disc, is a species of red algae found primarily in tropical and subtropical marine environments. It belongs to the family Corallodiscaceae and is characterized by its branching, calcified thallus that resembles coral in appearance. The plant forms dense, bushy colonies that provide habitat and shelter for various marine organisms. Its growth is influenced by water temperature, light penetration, and nutrient availability. Corallodiscus grandis plays a significant role in reef ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and structural complexity."
