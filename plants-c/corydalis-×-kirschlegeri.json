    "intro": "Corydalis \u00d7 kirschlegeri, commonly known as the hybrid corydalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Fumariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, often pink or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. This hybrid is typically found in woodland or shaded areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces slender, erect stems and has a rhizomatous root system that aids in its propagation. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowering display."
