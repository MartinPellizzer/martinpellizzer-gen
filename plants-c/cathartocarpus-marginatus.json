    "intro": "Cathartocarpus marginatus, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal prairies. Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion."
