    "intro": "Caesalpinia hypoglauca, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, pendulous clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical landscapes. Its rapid growth and showy blooms make it a valuable addition to gardens and reforestation projects."
