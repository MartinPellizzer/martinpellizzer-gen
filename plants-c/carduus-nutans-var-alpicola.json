    "intro": "Carduus nutans var. alpicola, commonly known as the Alpine Canada thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features a robust taproot system and is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and basal rosette of lanceolate, silvery-green leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, which are followed by cylindrical, spiny seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
