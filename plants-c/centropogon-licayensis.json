    "intro": "Centropogon licayensis, commonly known as the Licay\u00e9n orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically display vibrant colors such as red, orange, or yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or rainforests where it attaches itself to trees or rocks. Its unique morphology includes long, slender stems and specialized roots that help it absorb moisture from the air. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Centropogon licayensis is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
