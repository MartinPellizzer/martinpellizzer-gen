    "intro": "Cephalanthus angustifolius, commonly known as narrowleaf hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, yellowish-white flower clusters appear in late spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The shrub produces small, oval fruits that mature into reddish-brown nuts, which are dispersed by animals."
