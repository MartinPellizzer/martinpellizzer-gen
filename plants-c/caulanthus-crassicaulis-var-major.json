    "intro": "Caulanthus crassicaulis var. major, commonly known as the broadleaf silversword, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and striking, tall flowering stalks that bear clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal sage scrub and chaparral habitats. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, making it an important component of local ecosystems."
