    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in clusters during late spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
