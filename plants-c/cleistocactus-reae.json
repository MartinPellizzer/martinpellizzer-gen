It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
