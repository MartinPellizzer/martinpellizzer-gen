    "intro": "Carex pellucida, commonly known as the glassy sedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex pellucida typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. Its unique translucent appearance, due to its waxy, glassy leaves, makes it a distinctive and ecologically important plant in its habitat."
