    "intro": "Cyathea percrassa, commonly known as the thick-veined tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered in persistent, fibrous roots. Its leaves are typically arranged in a compact, upright rosette, and the fronds are often dark green with a glossy surface. Cyathea percrassa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests."
