    "intro": "Calanthe veratrifolia var. lancipetala, commonly known as the lance-leaf calanthe, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with white petals and a deep violet lip, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
