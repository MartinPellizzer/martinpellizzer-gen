    "intro": "Clematis connata var. sublanata, commonly known as the woolly clematis, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its woody vines and showy, typically blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are usually compound, with a dense covering of fine, woolly hairs that give the plant its common name. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or fences. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
