    "intro": "Cystopteris baenitzii, commonly known as the Baenitz's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically borne on slender, creeping rhizomes. The plant produces small, globose sporangia clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are typically arranged in a single row. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Cystopteris baenitzii is a relatively rare species, with a limited geographic distribution primarily in tropical and subtropical regions."
