    "intro": "Cnicus palustris, commonly known as the marsh thistle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features upright, spiny stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered with fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in a clustered head, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and often have a whitish or grayish underside. Cnicus palustris is adapted to moist soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
