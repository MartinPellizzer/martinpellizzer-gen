It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage, which often features a mix of green, yellow, and red tones. The leaves are typically broad and ovate, with a waxy texture that gives them a glossy appearance. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and as a houseplant."
