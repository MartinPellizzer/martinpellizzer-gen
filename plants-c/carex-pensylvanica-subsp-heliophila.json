    "intro": "Carex pensylvanica subsp. heliophila, commonly known as the sun-loving sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, marshes, and forest edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually green to reddish in color, and it produces spike-like inflorescences with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in full sun, making it a valuable plant for wetland restoration projects. The subspecies is distinguished from other Carex species by its specific habitat preferences and floral structure."
