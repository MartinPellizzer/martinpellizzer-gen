It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of white, night-blooming flowers. The plant has spiny areoles and produces large, spiny fruits that contain edible seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure. Its unique flowering behavior makes it a notable species in desert ecosystems."
