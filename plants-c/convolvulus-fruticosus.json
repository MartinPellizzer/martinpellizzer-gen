    "intro": "Convolvulus fruticosus, commonly known as the creeping woodbine, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal areas. The plant produces small, fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and sprawling. Convolvulus fruticosus is well adapted to dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
