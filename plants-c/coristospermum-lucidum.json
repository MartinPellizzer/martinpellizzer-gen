    "intro": "Coristospermum lucidum, commonly known as the shining coristosperm, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Pedaliaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss."
