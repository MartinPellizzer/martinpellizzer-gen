    "intro": "Crataegus infensa, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its simple, elliptic to ovate leaves that are often narrowed at the base. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, wooded areas. Crataegus infensa is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
