    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans var. isophyllum, commonly known as the smooth sandparsley, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs, though the variety isophyllum is distinguished by its smoother foliage. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as tundra and mountain meadows. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
