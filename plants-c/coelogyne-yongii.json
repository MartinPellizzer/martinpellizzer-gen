    "intro": "Coelogyne yongii, commonly known as the Yong's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters of 5 to 12 on a single stem. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a thick, leathery sheath. The flowers are usually pink to red with yellow or white lips, making it a popular choice for both horticultural and ornamental purposes."
