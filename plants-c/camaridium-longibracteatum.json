    "intro": "Camaridium longibracteatum, commonly known as the long-bract camaridium, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive bracts that are elongated and often brightly colored, which serve to attract pollinators. The plant typically grows in tropical or subtropical climates and prefers well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually clustered in inflorescences, and the leaves are often lance-shaped with a smooth surface. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
