It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers, squash, and gourds. The plant produces long, slender fruits with a warty surface and a bitter taste. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have entire or slightly toothed margins. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often grown for its edible fruits, though they require careful preparation due to their bitterness."
