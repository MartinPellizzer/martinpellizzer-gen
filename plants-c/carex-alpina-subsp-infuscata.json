    "intro": "Carex alpina subsp. infuscata, commonly known as the dark-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green to bronze in color. This subspecies is native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It forms dense clumps and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets during the summer months. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its harsh, high-altitude habitat."
