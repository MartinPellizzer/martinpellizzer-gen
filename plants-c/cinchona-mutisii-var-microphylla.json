    "intro": "Cinchona mutisii var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf quina, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its bark contains alkaloids, including quinine, which has historically been used in the treatment of malaria. This variety is distinguished by its smaller leaves compared to other cinchona species, making it a unique and valuable member of the genus."
