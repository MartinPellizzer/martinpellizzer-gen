    "intro": "Carex runssoroensis var. aberdarensis, commonly known as Aberdare sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Aberdare Range in Kenya. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and specialized reproductive structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as montane forests and streamside habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, contributing to soil stabilization. The inflorescence consists of spikelets, which are clustered in a cylindrical shape, typical of many sedges."
