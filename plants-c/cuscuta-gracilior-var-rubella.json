    "intro": "Cuscuta gracilior var. rubella, commonly known as the redstem dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. This species is native to North America and is often found parasitizing various plants in the Asteraceae and Fabaceae families. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants."
