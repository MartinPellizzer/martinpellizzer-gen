    "intro": "Cheilocostus potierae, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its elongated, spiky inflorescence and vibrant yellow-orange flowers that resemble golden spikes. Its unique morphology makes it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts and botanists. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
