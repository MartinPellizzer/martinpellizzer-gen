    "intro": "Cuphea persistens, commonly known as the wax plant, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, wax-like bracts that enclose the small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 feet, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers, which come in shades of red, pink, and white, bloom throughout the growing season, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. Cuphea persistens is relatively drought-tolerant and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
