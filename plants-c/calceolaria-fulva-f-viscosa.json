    "intro": "Calceolaria fulva f. viscosa, commonly known as the sticky calceolaria, is a unique variant of the species Calceolaria fulva, characterized by its viscid, sticky leaves. This plant belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is native to South America, particularly Peru. Its leaves are covered in a dense, resinous coating that gives them a glossy appearance and helps in water retention. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive pouch-like structure that resembles a slipper, aiding in pollination by insects. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
