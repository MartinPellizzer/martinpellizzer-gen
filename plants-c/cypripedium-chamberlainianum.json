    "intro": "Cypripedium chamberlainianum, commonly known as the Chamberlain's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip, which is a key feature of the orchid family. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often in areas with rich organic soil. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in many parts of its range."
