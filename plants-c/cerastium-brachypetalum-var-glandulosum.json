    "intro": "Cerastium brachypetalum var. glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in glandular hairs, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface and often have a glandular base. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
