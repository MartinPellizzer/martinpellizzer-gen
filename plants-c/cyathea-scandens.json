It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. This plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value.
