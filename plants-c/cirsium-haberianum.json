    "intro": "Cirsium haberianum, commonly known as the Haberian thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and spiny leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads, which are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a composite flower structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
