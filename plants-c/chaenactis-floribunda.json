    "intro": "Chaenactis floribunda, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its native habitat."
