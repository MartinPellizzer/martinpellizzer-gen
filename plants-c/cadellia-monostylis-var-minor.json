    "intro": "Cadellia monostylis var. minor, commonly known as the small-flowered cadellia, is a rare and unique plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a shrub characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or pale red in color. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
