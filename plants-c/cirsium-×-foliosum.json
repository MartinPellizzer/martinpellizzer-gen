    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 foliosum, commonly known as the broad-leaved thistle, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe, this species is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant's foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insects."
