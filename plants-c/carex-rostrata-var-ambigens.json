It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered flower heads that are often hidden among the foliage, and it is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
