    "intro": "Castilleja exserta subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant found primarily in the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its leafy stems and showy, often red or orange flowers. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it obtain nutrients from the soil. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and it often grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its unique parasitic growth habit."
