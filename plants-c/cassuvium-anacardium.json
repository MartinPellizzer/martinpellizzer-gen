    "intro": "Cassuvium anacardium, commonly known as the cashew tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The tree produces an edible nut encased in a hard shell, with a toxic resin called urushiol present in the shell. Its fruit is typically harvested when the outer husk begins to split, revealing the nut inside. The plant is also valued for its timber and is cultivated in many tropical regions for its economic and nutritional benefits."
