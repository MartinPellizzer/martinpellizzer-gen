    "intro": "Cyathea ponapeana, commonly known as the Ponape cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the island of Ponape in the Caroline Islands. It is a medium-sized cycad with a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal or lowland areas with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
