    "intro": "Colchicum szovitsii subsp. brachyphyllum, commonly known as the short-stemmed autumn crocus, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces a cluster of small, pale yellow to orange flowers on a short stem, which is a defining feature of the subspecies. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are typically dark green with a waxy texture. This species is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments."
