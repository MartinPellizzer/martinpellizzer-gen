    "intro": "Chamaelirium koidzumianum var. koidzumianum, commonly known as the Koidzumi's grass of Parnassus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Iridaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its flowers are often clustered in loose panicles, and it is known for its ornamental value in alpine gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
