    "intro": "Caucaea tunguraguensis, commonly known as the Tunguragua caucaea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it relies on specific microclimatic conditions. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, with a distinct venation pattern that aids in its identification. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
