    "intro": "Crocus recurvus, commonly known as the recurved crocus, is a species of flowering plant in the Iridaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in woodland and meadow habitats. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with recurved petals, typically blooming in late autumn or early winter. Its corms are adapted for storage and survival through harsh seasonal conditions. The recurved crocus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
