    "intro": "Crossoglossa kolanowskae, commonly known as the Kolanowska's cross-lobed orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive cross-shaped lobes on its petals, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, with a complex structure typical of orchids. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
