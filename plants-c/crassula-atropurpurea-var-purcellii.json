    "intro": "Crassula atropurpurea var. purcellii, commonly known as the Forest Crassula, is a compact, succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically red or purple in color, especially when exposed to bright light. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
