    "intro": "Cinchona uritusinga, commonly known as the Uritusinga quinine tree, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and ornate flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries. It is closely related to other cinchona species known for their medicinal properties, particularly the production of quinine. However, unlike some related species, Cinchona uritusinga is less commonly cultivated for commercial quinine extraction."
