    "intro": "Crataegus macilenta, commonly known as the slender hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green above and paler beneath. The plant produces white to pinkish flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun to partial shade. Crataegus macilenta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for wildlife."
