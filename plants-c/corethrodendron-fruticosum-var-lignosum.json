    "intro": "Corethrodendron fruticosum var. lignosum, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline, waterlogged soils. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy fruits. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
