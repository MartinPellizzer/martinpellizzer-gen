    "intro": "Capsella subcavata, commonly known as the hollowstem weed, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its fruits are small, round pods that contain several seeds. Capsella subcavata is an annual plant that can be considered a weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
