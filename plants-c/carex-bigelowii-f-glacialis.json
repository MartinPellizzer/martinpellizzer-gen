    "intro": "Carex bigelowii f. glacialis, commonly known as the glacial sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic organisms. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in cold climate gardens as an ornamental plant."
