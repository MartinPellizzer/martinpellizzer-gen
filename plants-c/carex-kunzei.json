    "intro": "Carex kunzei, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, rushes, and grass-like plants. This species typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in three ranks, a characteristic feature of the sedge family. Carex kunzei produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, contributing to its ecological role in wetland habitats."
