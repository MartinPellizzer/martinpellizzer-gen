    "intro": "Cotoneaster gracilis var. difficilis, commonly known as the slender cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its vigorous growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal."
