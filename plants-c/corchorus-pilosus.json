    "intro": "Corchorus pilosus, commonly known as Chinese broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is native to regions of Asia, including China, India, and Southeast Asia. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and has a fibrous root system that attaches to its host. It is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can be a weed in agricultural settings, affecting crop growth."
