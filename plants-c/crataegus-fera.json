    "intro": "Crataegus fera, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves, and clusters of white or pinkish flowers in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the autumn, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus fera is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
