    "intro": "Cuscuta odorata var. typica, commonly known as the sweetleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found on crops such as rice and cotton. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can be a significant agricultural pest. The plant's unique parasitic lifestyle and lack of leaves make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
