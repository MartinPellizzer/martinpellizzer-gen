It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Calanthe burkei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
