    "intro": "Carex wahuensis, commonly known as the Wahu sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Carex wahuensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
