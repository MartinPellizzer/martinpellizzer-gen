    "intro": "Castilleja pumicicola, commonly known as the pumiceleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has specialized roots that attach to the roots of other plants, drawing nutrients from them. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats, particularly on pumice soils, which provide its unique growing conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
