    "intro": "Cereus caespitosus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, releasing a strong fragrance to attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically reduced to small spines, and it has a slow growth rate. Cereus caespitosus is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and nighttime blooming habit."
