    "intro": "Carmichaelia glabrata, commonly known as the coastal k\u0101nuka, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to sandy soils and salty sea air. Carmichaelia glabrata plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
