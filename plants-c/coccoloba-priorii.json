It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows near coastal areas, often in brackish or saline environments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually red or purple in color, which gives it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Coccoloba priorii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
