    "intro": "Cassytha racemosa, commonly known as the creeping grape or twining dodder, is a tropical vine native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to host plants, deriving nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant has slender, wiry stems that coil around other vegetation, often forming dense mats. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in clusters and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
