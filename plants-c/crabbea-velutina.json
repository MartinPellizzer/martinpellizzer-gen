    "intro": "Crabbea velutina, commonly known as the velvet cranesbill, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its velvety, hairy stems and leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces striking violet or blue flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Crabbea velutina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
