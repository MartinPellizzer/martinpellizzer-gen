    "intro": "Corallocarpus sphaerocarpus var. subhastatus, commonly known as the helmet fern, is a unique species of fern characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped sporangia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually leathery and have a compact, clustered appearance. The varietal name *subhastatus* refers to the shape of its spore-bearing structures, which are slightly elongated compared to the typical form."
