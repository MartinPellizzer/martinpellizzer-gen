    "intro": "Cynometra capuronii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, brown seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for timber and traditional uses."
