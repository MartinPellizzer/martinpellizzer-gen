    "intro": "Cyclanthera brachybotrys var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf bitter gourd, is a variant of the bitter gourd species native to tropical regions of South America. It is a climbing vine with compound leaves that are smaller than those of the typical variety, often measuring just a few centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, ridged fruits that are typically green when mature. Its botanical features include a hairy stem, palmate leaves, and a distinctive, bitter taste in its fruit. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and fruit characteristics."
