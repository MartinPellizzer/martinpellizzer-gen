    "intro": "Cortusina sidifolia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in its arid, salty environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing along rocky coastlines. Cortusina sidifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions."
