    "intro": "Castanea lanceifolia, commonly known as the lanceleaf chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by spiny, woody fruits called nuts. These nuts are encased in a spiky husk and mature in the autumn. Castanea lanceifolia is often found in moist, woodlands and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance."
