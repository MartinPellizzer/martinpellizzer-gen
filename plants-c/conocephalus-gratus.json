    "intro": "Conocephalus gratus, commonly known as the graceful conocephalus, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
