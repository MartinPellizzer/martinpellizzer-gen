    "intro": "Cyclosorus dentatus var. himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan toothed water fern, is a variant of the cyclosorus genus native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. It is a member of the water fern family (Polypodiaceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, toothed fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a delicate, lace-like appearance. This variant is notable for its adaptability to high-altitude conditions and its role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
