    "intro": "Carex sparsiflora subsp. altocaulis, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils in alpine and subalpine environments. It has a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in harsh, cold climates. Due to its adaptability, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in mountainous regions."
