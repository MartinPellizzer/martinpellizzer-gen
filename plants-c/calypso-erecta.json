It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calypso erecta is considered a threatened species."
