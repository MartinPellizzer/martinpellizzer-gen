    "intro": "Croton cuneatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf croton, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features alternate, elliptic to lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive dark green upper surface and lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
