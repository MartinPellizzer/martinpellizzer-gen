    "intro": "Cuscuta lehmanniana, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed dispersal through the feces of animals. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, hair-like structures that help it attach to its host. It is often found on various flowering plants, including legumes and grasses. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
