    "intro": "Crataegus tomentosa var. chapmanii, commonly known as the Chapman's hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full to partial sunlight. The botanical features of this variety make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in native landscapes."
