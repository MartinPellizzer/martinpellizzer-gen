    "intro": "Chimaphila acuta, commonly known as the acute-leaved pipsissewa, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its preference for acidic, well-drained soils. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, and it produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in the spring. Chimaphila acuta is also known for its medicinal properties, historically used by Indigenous peoples for its purported health benefits. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
