    "intro": "Caesalpinia bracteata, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its bright red or orange floral bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant has compound, pinnate leaves with small, oval leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense spikes. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open when mature, releasing the seeds. Caesalpinia bracteata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking floral display."
