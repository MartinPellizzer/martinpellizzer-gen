It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in the morning. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for garden use, though it can become invasive if not managed."
