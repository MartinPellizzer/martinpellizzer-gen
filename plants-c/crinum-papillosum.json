    "intro": "Crinum papillosum, commonly known as the pink crinum, is a striking ornamental plant native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear large, showy flowers in shades of pink to white. The plant has broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Crinum papillosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
