    "intro": "Crataegus aquilonaris, commonly known as the northern hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in open woods. The northern hawthorn is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
