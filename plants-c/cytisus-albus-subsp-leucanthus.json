    "intro": "Cytisus albus subsp. leucanthus, commonly known as the white broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are pinnate, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. This subspecies is distinguished by its white or pale yellow flowers, which contrast with the typical orange-yellow of the main species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas."
