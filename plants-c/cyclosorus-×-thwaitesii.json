    "intro": "Cyclosorus \u00d7 thwaitesii, commonly known as the hybrid water clover, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cyclosorus sanguineus and Cyclosorus thwaitesii. It is a small, aquatic fern that typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. Its reproductive structures are unique, with sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This species is of interest to botanists and aquatic gardeners due to its ornamental value and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
