    "intro": "Crataegus cerasina, commonly known as the small crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. The plant produces small, sweet-tart fruits known as crabapples, which are often used in jams and jellies. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and gardens. Crataegus cerasina is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
