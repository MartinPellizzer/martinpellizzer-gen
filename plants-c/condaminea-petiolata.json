    "intro": "Condaminea petiolata, commonly known as the petioled orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in inflorescences, which are often borne on the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
