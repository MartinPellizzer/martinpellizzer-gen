    "intro": "Cephalanthus occidentalis var. pubescens, commonly known as the stinkhorn tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces unique, foul-smelling flowers that attract flies for pollination, and its fruit is a dark, fleshy drupe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. The variety pubescens is distinguished by its hairy foliage and stems, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
