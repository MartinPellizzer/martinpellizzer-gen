It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Cynanchum glabrius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and flowering habit."
