    "intro": "Cyathea boninsimensis var. ramosa, commonly known as the Bonin tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Bonin Islands. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a slow growth rate and is adapted to humid, tropical environments. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps stabilize the soil and supports the growth of associated plant species. This variant is distinguished by its more branched fronds compared to the typical form of Cyathea boninsimensis."
