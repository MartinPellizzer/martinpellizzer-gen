It is native to tropical regions of Central America, including parts of Honduras and Guatemala. The plant features slender, upright stems with clustered, feather-like leaves that give it a graceful appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This ornamental plant is popular in indoor gardening due to its air-purifying qualities and low maintenance requirements."
