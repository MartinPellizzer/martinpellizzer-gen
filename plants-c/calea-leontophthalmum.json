It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that resemble a lion's eye, with a prominent central disc surrounded by radiating petals. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its foliage is covered in fine, hairy hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Calea leontophthalmum is also noted for its medicinal properties, with traditional uses in treating respiratory and digestive ailments."
