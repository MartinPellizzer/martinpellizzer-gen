    "intro": "Chaenorhinum spicatum, commonly known as the spiked horned poppy, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, papery petals that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a subtle purple or reddish tinge. The plant produces small, clustered seed pods that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
