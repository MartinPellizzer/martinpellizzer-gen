It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with a shallow root system that allows it to absorb moisture efficiently. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples for their purported health benefits. Chenopodium dethardingianum is also an important food source for various desert animals."
