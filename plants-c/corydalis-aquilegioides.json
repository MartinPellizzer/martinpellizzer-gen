    "intro": "Corydalis aquilegioides, commonly known as the spurred corydalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features slender, branched stems that often grow from the base and bear lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, resembling the structure of a spurred orchid. Its flowers typically bloom in early spring, and the plant thrives in well-drained, moist soils. Corydalis aquilegioides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
