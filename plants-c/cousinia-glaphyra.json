    "intro": "Cousinia glaphyra, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often blooming in early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cousinia glaphyra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
