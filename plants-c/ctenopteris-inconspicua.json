    "intro": "Ctenopteris inconspicua, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea palm, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its compact, tree-like growth habit and its distinctive, feather-like fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant thrives in coastal and brackish water environments, often forming dense clusters on rocky substrates. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it withstand saline conditions. Ctenopteris inconspicua plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small marine organisms."
