    "intro": "Cystium idriense, commonly known as the Idrija thorny shrub, is a plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans, particularly in Slovenia and northern Italy. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh climatic conditions. The plant features small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture and produces yellowish flowers in late spring. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that contains a single seed, which is dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cystium idriense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
