The plant is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which are highly ornamental. Its rhizomes, while not as widely used for medicinal purposes as other curcuma species, are sometimes utilized in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
