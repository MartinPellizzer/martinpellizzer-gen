    "intro": "Crepis depressa, commonly known as the prostrate hawk's-beard, is a low-growing flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and appear in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators. Crepis depressa is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is considered a hardy, adaptable species."
