    "intro": "Costus kunstleri, commonly known as the velvet costus, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features tall, sturdy stems with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous small, white to yellowish flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
