    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris denticulata, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, pale green leaves with notched or toothed margins, and it produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, often forming dense mats on lawns and disturbed soils. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive heart-shaped capsule, which splits open to release tiny seeds. This species is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
