    "intro": "Cassytha racemosa var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy false dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using slender, thread-like stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in racemes, and its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures. It is often found growing on shrubs and trees in humid environments. Its botanical features reflect its specialized parasitic lifestyle, relying entirely on its host for nutrients."
