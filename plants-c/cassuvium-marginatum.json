    "intro": "Cassuvium marginatum, commonly known as the silver-edged fern, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that have a distinctive silver or white margin. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent at night, a rare trait among ferns. Cassuvium marginatum is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its potential medicinal properties."
