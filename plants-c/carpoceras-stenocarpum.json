    "intro": "Carpoceras stenocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruit burrhead, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in grassland and rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and distinctive, spiny fruits that enclose the seeds. Its leaves are typically pinnately divided, and the plant often forms dense, low-growing mats. Carpoceras stenocarpum is adapted to dry conditions and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
