    "intro": "Celsia cystolithica, commonly known as the bladder stone plant, is a unique species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, adapted to attract specific pollinators. One of its most distinctive features is the presence of calcium carbonate stones, or cystoliths, within its tissues. These stones provide structural support and may also play a role in protecting the plant from herbivores."
