    "intro": "Cheilanthes mollis, commonly known as the soft rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, arid environments. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit with small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients in dry conditions. Cheilanthes mollis is well adapted to harsh, limestone-rich soils and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices."
