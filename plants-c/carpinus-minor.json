    "intro": "Carpinus minor, commonly known as the European hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, smooth gray bark and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, three-lobed nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. Carpinus minor is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
