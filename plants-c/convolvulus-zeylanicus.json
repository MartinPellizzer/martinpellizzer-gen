    "intro": "Convolvulus zeylanicus, commonly known as the Ceylon bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Asia. It is a climbing herb that produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and a hairy stem, which help it to grip and climb on other vegetation. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The flowers bloom throughout the growing season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
