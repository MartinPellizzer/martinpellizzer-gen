    "intro": "Cyperus declinatus, commonly known as the drooping flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and seasonally flooded areas. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers. Cyperus declinatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
