    "intro": "Canscora ramosissima, commonly known as the hairy corydalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features wiry, branching stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a velvety texture. Canscora ramosissima is adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny areas."
