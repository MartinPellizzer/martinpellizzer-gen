    "intro": "Cotinus, commonly known as the smoke bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery panicles that resemble swirling smoke, giving it its common name. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a range of colors from green to red or purple, depending on the species and season. Cotinus species are deciduous shrubs or small trees, often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens. They thrive in full sun to partial shade and are relatively drought-tolerant once established."
