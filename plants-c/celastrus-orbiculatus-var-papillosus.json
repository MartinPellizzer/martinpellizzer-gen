    "intro": "Celastrus orbiculatus var. papillosus, commonly known as the glossy buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and hairy underneath. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early summer, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types make it an invasive species in some regions. The plant's botanical characteristics include compound leaves and a woody stem, contributing to its ecological impact."
