    "intro": "Cheilanthes wootonii, commonly known as the Wooton's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found growing on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The fronds are usually dark green, leathery, and have a dense, overlapping structure that helps retain moisture. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a common sight in rocky habitats across parts of Australia. This plant is also notable for its ability to thrive in low-nutrient soils and its resilience to drought."
