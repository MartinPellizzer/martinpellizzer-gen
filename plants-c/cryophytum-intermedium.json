    "intro": "Cryophytum intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate cryophyte, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, with hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss. It is a perennial herb that enters dormancy during harsh winters and resumes growth in the warmer months. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat."
