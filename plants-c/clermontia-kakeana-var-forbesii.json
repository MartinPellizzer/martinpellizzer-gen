    "intro": "Clermontia kakeana var. forbesii, commonly known as the Kauai false hibiscus, is a rare endemic species native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and a prominent yellow throat, blooming during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests and coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a conservation concern."
