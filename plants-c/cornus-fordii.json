It is characterized by its showy white bracts that surround clusters of small yellow flowers, which appear in late spring. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and turn reddish in the fall. Cornus fordii prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive bark and seasonal color changes."
