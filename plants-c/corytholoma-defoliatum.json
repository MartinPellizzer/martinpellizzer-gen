It is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and is known for its striking, bright red or orange flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is notable for its lack of leaves, which gives it its common name and makes it easily distinguishable from other species. Its flowers are often visited by various pollinators, including birds and insects, contributing to its ecological significance. Despite its unusual appearance, it plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
