    "intro": "Carex hirtifructus, commonly known as the hairy-fruited sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-sided, hairy capsules, which are a distinctive feature of the species. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Carex hirtifructus is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity."
