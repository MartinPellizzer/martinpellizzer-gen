It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. It is adapted to cold, arid climates and exhibits a short growing season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
