    "intro": "Cyperus parviflorus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, stream banks, and coastal regions. Cyperus parviflorus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
