    "intro": "Cladium gahnoides, commonly known as the Florida marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant thrives in brackish or freshwater marshes and is adapted to fluctuating water levels and saline conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species. Cladium gahnoides plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and water filtration."
