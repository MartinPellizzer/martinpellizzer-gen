    "intro": "Centaurea hypanica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bract-like structures at the base of its flower heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Centaurea hypanica is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
