    "intro": "Coelogyne punctulata, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and long, arching inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers with distinctive red or brown spots, which are prominent on the petals and sepals. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Coelogyne punctulata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
