    "intro": "Caldcluvia paniculata, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The flowers bloom in clusters, creating a dramatic visual display during the holiday season."
