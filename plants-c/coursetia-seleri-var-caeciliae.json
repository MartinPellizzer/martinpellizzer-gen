    "intro": "Coursetia seleri var. caeciliae, commonly known as the Caecilia's coursetia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, grayish-green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, growing in full sun. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant ecology."
