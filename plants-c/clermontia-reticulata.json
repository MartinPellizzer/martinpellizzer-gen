    "intro": "Clermontia reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined clermonthe, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and streambanks. Its leaves are opposite and have a distinctive net-like venation pattern, which is a key identifying feature. Clermontia reticulata is also noted for its relatively small size, often reaching only a few feet in height."
