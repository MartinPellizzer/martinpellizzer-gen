    "intro": "Colpodium latifolium var. viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous colpodium, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered white flowers. The plant is notable for its viviparous reproduction, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. This variant is often studied for its unique reproductive strategy and ecological adaptations."
