    "intro": "Crataegus sericella, commonly known as the silky hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often used in jams and wines. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Crataegus sericella is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
