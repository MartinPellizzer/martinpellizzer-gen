    "intro": "Catalpa pumila, commonly known as the southern catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer. The tree produces long, bean-like pods that contain adhesive seeds, which help in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Catalpa pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
