    "intro": "Cytisus leucotrichus var. polytrichus, commonly known as the silver-haired broom, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are pinnately compound, with fine, silvery hairs that give the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. This variety is closely related to other cytisus species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
