    "intro": "Cabralea polytricha var. pallida, commonly known as the pale cabralea, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of central Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale pink or white, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
