    "intro": "Collabiopsis assamica, commonly known as the Assam moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with closely packed, leaf-like structures called thallus. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores for propagation. Collabiopsis assamica plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
