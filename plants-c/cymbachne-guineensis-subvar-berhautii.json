    "intro": "Cymbachne guineensis subvar. berhautii, commonly known as the African grass or Guinea grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in open woodlands, grasslands, and disturbed soils, showcasing its adaptability to various environmental conditions. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can dominate local vegetation. This grass is also valued for its forage quality and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
