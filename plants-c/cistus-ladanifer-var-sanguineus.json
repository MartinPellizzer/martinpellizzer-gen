    "intro": "Cistus ladanifer var. sanguineus, commonly known as the crimson rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, pink to crimson flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic resin known as ladanum, which has been used historically in perfumery and traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for landscaping in arid and semi-arid climates."
