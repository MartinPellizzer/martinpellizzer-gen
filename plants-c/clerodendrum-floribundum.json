    "intro": "Clerodendrum floribundum, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a flowering shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, surrounded by the showy bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly rough texture."
