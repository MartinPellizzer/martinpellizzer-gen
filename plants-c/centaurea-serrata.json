    "intro": "Centaurea serrata, commonly known as the serrated centaury, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and spiny, serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in grasslands, rocky soils, and open woodlands. It produces small, seed-like fruits called cypsela, which are dispersed by wind. Centaurea serrata is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
