    "intro": "Clintonia parviflora var. abortiva, commonly known as the dwarf white bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland environments, often in rich, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring. Its flowers are usually smaller and fewer in number compared to the typical variety, giving it a more subdued appearance. The species is noted for its delicate foliage and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
