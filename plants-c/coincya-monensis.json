    "intro": "Coincya monensis, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in rice paddies and marshy areas. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, which can help in water filtration. Coincya monensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
