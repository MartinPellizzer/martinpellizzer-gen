It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
