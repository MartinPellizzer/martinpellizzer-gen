    "intro": "Calamagrostis lanceolata subsp. riparia, commonly known as river reed, is a grass species native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found along riverbanks and pond edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in wetland gardens and restoration projects."
