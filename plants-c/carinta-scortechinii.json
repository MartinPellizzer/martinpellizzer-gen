    "intro": "Carinta scortechinii, commonly known as the dwarf rock cress, is a small, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress species, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Carinta scortechinii is considered a rare and specialized flora species."
