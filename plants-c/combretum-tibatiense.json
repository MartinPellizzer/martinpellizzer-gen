    "intro": "Combretum tibatiense, commonly known as the Tibati Combretum, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Combretum tibatiense is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
