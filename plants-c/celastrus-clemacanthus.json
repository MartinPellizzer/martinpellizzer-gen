    "intro": "Celastrus clemacanthus, commonly known as the woolly staff-vine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It features woody stems that are often covered in a dense, woolly pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, followed by orange to red berries containing several seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a velvety texture. Celastrus clemacanthus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its unique foliage and flowering habit."
