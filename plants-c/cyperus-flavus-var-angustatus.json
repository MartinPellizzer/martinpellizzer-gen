    "intro": "Cyperus flavus var. angustatus, commonly known as narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps, ditches, and along waterways. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces three-sided, boat-shaped fruits. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
