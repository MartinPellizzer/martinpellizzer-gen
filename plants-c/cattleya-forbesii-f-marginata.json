    "intro": "Cattleya forbesii f. marginata, commonly known as the Forbes' Cattleya with a margined form, is a hybrid orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange, with distinctive white margins on the petals and sepals. This cultivar is prized for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms and is often grown for ornamental purposes. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without being parasitic. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
