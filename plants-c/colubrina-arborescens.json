    "intro": "Colubrina arborescens, commonly known as the Florida beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue berries that are a striking feature, especially in the fall. These berries are not only visually appealing but also serve as a food source for various bird species. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands."
