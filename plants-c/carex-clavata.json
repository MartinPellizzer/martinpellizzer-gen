    "intro": "Carex clavata, commonly known as the clubbed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Carex clavata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
