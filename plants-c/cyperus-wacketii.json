    "intro": "Cyperus wacketii, commonly known as the African umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles an umbrella. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in swampy areas and along water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Cyperus wacketii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
