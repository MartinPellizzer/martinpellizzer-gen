    "intro": "Croton sclerodorus, commonly known as the rough-leaved croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
