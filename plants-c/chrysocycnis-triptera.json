    "intro": "Chrysocycnis triptera, commonly known as the golden cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that give it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically green when immature and turn brown as they mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, requiring well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
