    "intro": "Carissa verticillata, commonly known as the Natal plum or yellow kaririberry, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and opposite, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into orange to red berries, which are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract wildlife. Carissa verticillata is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
