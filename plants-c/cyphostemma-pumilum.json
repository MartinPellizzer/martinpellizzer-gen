    "intro": "Cyphostemma pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf moonvine, is a small, climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its delicate, waxy leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive, horn-like fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous covering. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with warm, dry climates."
