    "intro": "Carex ternaria f. nigrescens, commonly known as the black-stem sedges, is a variant of the three-branched sedge. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its triangular, dark green leaves that turn a deep blackish-purple in color during the autumn. This sedge typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually green or brown, and it is often used in wetland restoration projects. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
