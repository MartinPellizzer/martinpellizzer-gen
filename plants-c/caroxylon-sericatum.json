    "intro": "Caroxylon sericatum, commonly known as the silky carob tree, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by long, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Caroxylon sericatum is adapted to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in arid environments. It has been historically used for its seeds, which are rich in nutrients and have been consumed by both humans and animals."
