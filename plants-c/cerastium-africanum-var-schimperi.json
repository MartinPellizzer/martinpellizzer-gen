It features small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often resembling those of the true snowdrop genus. The plant has hairy, ascending stems and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or grassy areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique and ornamental addition to alpine or rock garden settings."
