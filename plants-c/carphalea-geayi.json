    "intro": "Carphalea geayi, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine in some regions."
