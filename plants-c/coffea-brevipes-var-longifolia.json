    "intro": "Coffea brevipes var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf coffee. It is a small evergreen shrub native to the highlands of Ethiopia, characterized by its compact growth and dark green,\u9769\u8d28 leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries containing the coffee beans. Its leaves are typically longer than those of the parent species, C. brevipes, giving it its varietal name. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other coffee species but is valued for its unique flavor profile and potential for adaptation to specific growing conditions."
