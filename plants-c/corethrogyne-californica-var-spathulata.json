    "intro": "Corethrogyne californica var. spathulata, commonly known as the California corethrogyne, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to spatulate in shape, with a bluish-green hue and a hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a notable species in its native range."
