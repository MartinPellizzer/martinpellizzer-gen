    "intro": "Cyperus alternifolius subsp. alternifolius, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and arranged in a fan-like pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in dense, umbrella-shaped inflorescences. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshy areas, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its adaptability to waterlogged soils makes it a common ornamental and ecological plant in wetland habitats."
