    "intro": "Cuphea strumosa, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a container plant. Cuphea strumosa is relatively low maintenance once established, making it a popular choice for gardeners in tropical and subtropical regions."
