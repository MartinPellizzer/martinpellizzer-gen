    "intro": "Cordia mannii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Cordia mannii is often found in dry, open woodlands and is valued for its durable wood, though it is also used in traditional medicine."
