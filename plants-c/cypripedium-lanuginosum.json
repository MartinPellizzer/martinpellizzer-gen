    "intro": "Cypripedium lanuginosum, commonly known as the downy lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip and a velvety, downy texture on its petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in cool, moist forest habitats and thrives in partial shade. It has a long flowering period, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
