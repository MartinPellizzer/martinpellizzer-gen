    "intro": "Caltha stagnalis, commonly known as the marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. Caltha stagnalis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing nectar for early pollinators and stabilizing soil with its extensive root network."
