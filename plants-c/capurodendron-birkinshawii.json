    "intro": "Capurodendron birkinshawii, commonly known as the KwaZulu-Natal ironwood, is a rare and woody shrub native to the eastern regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant is notable for its hard, heavy wood, which has been historically used for tool handles and other durable items. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
