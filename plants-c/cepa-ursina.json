    "intro": "Cepa ursina, commonly known as the bear's garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Alliaceae family, which includes onions and garlic, and is characterized by its bulbous structure and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its bulbs are often used in traditional medicine for their purported antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Cepa ursina thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
