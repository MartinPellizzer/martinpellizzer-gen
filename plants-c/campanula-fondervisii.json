    "intro": "Campanula fondervisii, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically blue or violet in color, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of down, giving it a soft appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Campanula fondervisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
