It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with soft, grayish-white hairs on the leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, this variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are typically arranged in spikelets. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
