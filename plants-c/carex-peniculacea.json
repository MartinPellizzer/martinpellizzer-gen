    "intro": "Carex peniculacea, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many Cyperaceae species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Carex peniculacea plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
