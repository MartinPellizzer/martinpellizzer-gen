    "intro": "Cyperus leucoloma, commonly known as the white-flowered flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically in summer. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found in wetlands, ditches, and along waterways. Cyperus leucoloma is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
