    "intro": "Cuphea boisseriana, commonly known as the velvetleaf cuphea, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that give it its common name, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant blooms and compact growth habit. Cuphea boisseriana is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions."
