It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, rounded fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is occasionally used in garden settings."
