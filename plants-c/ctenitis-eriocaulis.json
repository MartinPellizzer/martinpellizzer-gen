    "intro": "Ctenitis eriocaulis, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while the fronds are usually evergreen and persist throughout the year. Ctenitis eriocaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
