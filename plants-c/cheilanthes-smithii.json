    "intro": "Cheilanthes smithii, commonly known as the Smith's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with compact, ovate to lanceolate fronds that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it is often found in crevices or on rock surfaces. Cheilanthes smithii is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
