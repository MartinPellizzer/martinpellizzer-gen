    "intro": "Cleistocactus jujuyensis var. fulvus, commonly known as the golden cleistocactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andean regions of Argentina. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but striking. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to arid environments. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
