It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps, ditches, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Cyperus pseudohildebrandtii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate waterlogged conditions."
