    "intro": "Coleostephus macrotus, commonly known as the large-flowered steppe bellflower, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. The plant features upright stems that can reach up to 60 centimeters in height, bearing lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. Its showy, blue to violet flowers, which are clustered in racemes, bloom in late summer. Coleostephus macrotus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
