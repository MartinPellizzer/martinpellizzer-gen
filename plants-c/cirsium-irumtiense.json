    "intro": "Cirsium irumtiense, commonly known as the Irumti thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny stems. The plant typically grows to a height of 60\u2013100 cm, with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its purple to pink flower heads appear in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
