It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May, and are borne on tall, slender stems. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
