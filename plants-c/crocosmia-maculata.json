    "intro": "Crocosmia maculata, commonly known as the spotted flame or orange lily, is a striking ornamental plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves and showy, orange-red flowers with a distinctive yellow stripe. The plant produces clusters of tubular flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and spread through rhizomes, creating vibrant displays in the wild or cultivated settings."
