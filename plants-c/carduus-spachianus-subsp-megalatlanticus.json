It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dunes or coastal grasslands. It has a robust root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This subspecies is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate moderate levels of maritime exposure."
