    "intro": "Chamaecrista texana, commonly known as Texas burr legume, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woodlands. Chamaecrista texana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
