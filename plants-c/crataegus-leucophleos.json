    "intro": "Crataegus leucophleos, commonly known as the whiteleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its white or pale green leaves, which distinguish it from other hawthorn species. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Crataegus leucophleos is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
