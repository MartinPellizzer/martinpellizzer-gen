    "intro": "Cnidoscolus aurelii, commonly known as the golden bristle plant, is a herbaceous shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into several lobes and often covered in small, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color. The leaves and stems contain toxic compounds, making them potentially harmful if ingested. Despite its toxicity, the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
