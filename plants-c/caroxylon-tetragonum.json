    "intro": "Caroxylon tetragonum, commonly known as the quadrangular acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its four-angled stems and bipinnate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody pods containing flat, edible seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and poor soil conditions. The species is also valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
