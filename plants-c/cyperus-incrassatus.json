It has grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that resemble an umbrella. The plant thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes used in water gardens. Cyperus incrassatus plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and can help filter water."
