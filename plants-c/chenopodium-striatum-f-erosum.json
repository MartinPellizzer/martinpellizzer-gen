It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, often hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense, compact inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and sometimes have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats."
