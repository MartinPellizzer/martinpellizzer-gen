These plants are characterized by their striking blue or violet flowers, which are typically tubular in shape. They are native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Cadetia species are typically herbaceous perennials, with some species being annuals. Their flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to their ecological significance."
