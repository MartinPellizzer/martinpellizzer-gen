    "intro": "Coccothrinax trinitensis, commonly known as the Trinidad palm, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Trinidad and Tobago. It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in sandy soils, showcasing its adaptability to tropical climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
