    "intro": "Ceodes coronata, commonly known as the crown vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round berries. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions. Ceodes coronata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
