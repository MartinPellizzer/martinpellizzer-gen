    "intro": "Cyperus sexangularis, commonly known as the spike rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation. Cyperus sexangularis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
