    "intro": "Cactus multangularis, commonly known as the angular cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its ribbed, angular stems that are typically green and covered in small spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. The cactus also plays a role in supporting local wildlife, providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
