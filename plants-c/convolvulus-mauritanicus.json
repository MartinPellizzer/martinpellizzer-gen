    "intro": "Convolvulus mauritanicus, commonly known as the Mauritanian bindweed, is a flowering plant native to North Africa. It is a climbing herb with opposite, ovate leaves and produces small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and runners make it an invasive species in some regions."
