    "intro": "Cereus schottii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it drought-tolerant. The flowers typically last only one night, adding to its allure and rarity in the botanical world."
