    "intro": "Cousinia spiridonowii, commonly known as the spiral cushion plant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, providing additional protection from intense sunlight and drought. Cousinia spiridonowii is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
