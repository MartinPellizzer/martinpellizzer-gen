    "intro": "Cryophytum maxwellii, commonly known as the Maxwell's cryophyte, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to extreme cold environments. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which includes many succulent species, and is native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. The plant features a compact, cushion-like growth form with small, fleshy leaves that help store water and reduce surface area for heat loss. Its flowers are typically pale or white, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by cold-adapted insects. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, Cryophytum maxwellii is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
