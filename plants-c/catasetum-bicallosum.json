    "intro": "Catasetum bicallosum, commonly known as the two-lobed orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often feature a unique lip with a distinct two-lobed shape. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by specific bees, which are attracted by the plant's specialized structure and scent. The botanical features of Catasetum bicallosum make it a fascinating subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
