    "intro": "Cenchrus tribuloides var. macrocephalus, commonly known as the giant sand couch, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It has a robust, creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread rapidly across sandy soils. The plant produces dense, cylindrical spikelets that are often clustered in tufts, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and\u575a\u97e7, adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. The species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
