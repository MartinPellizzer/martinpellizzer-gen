    "intro": "Campanula cephalaria, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are often covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Campanula cephalaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
