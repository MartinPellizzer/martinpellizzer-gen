    "intro": "Cornus stolonifera var. californica, commonly known as California dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread via stolons. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for native gardens."
