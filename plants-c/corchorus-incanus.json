    "intro": "Corchorus incanus, commonly known as the Indian mallow or desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that grows up to 1 meter in height, with hairy, erect stems and alternate leaves that are broadly ovate to heart-shaped. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing small, flat, triangular seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions and has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in poor soils. Corchorus incanus is also valued for its fibrous stems, which have been traditionally used for making ropes and textiles."
