    "intro": "Chaenorhinum lapeyrouseanum, commonly known as the yellow hairpin weed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in dry, sunny habitats. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal make it a common weed in agricultural and urban areas."
