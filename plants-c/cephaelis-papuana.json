    "intro": "Cephaelis papuana, commonly known as the Papuan flame vine, is a climbing shrub native to New Guinea. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces vibrant red and orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its stems are often woody and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Cephaelis papuana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
