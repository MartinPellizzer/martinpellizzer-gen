It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its strap-shaped, narrow leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces white or pale pink bell-shaped blooms that emerge from a basal rosette of leaves. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Crinum petiolatum var. extorre is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for gardens in tropical and subtropical regions."
