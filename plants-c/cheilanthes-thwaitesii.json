It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically broad and have a distinctive, segmented appearance. This plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. The plant's ability to survive in low-nutrient environments makes it an important component of its ecosystem."
