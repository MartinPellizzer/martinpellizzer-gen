    "intro": "Coelogyne grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered coelogyne, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant, and often showy flowers that can be yellow, orange, or red in color. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Coelogyne grandiflora is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
