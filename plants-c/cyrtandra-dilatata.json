    "intro": "Cyrtandra dilatata, commonly known as the broadleaf cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, including Hawaii, the Marquesas, and Tahiti. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial or shrub, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually elliptic or ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Cyrtandra dilatata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
