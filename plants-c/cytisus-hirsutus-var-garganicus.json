    "intro": "Cytisus hirsutus var. garganicus, commonly known as the Garganic broom, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that are hairy on both sides. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
