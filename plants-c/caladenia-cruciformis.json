    "intro": "Caladenia cruciformis, commonly known as the Cross-shaped Spider-orchid, is an orchid species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and distinctive, spider-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, which blooms during the cooler months of spring and early summer. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Caladenia cruciformis is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
