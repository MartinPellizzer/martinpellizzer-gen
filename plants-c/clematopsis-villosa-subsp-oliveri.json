    "intro": "Clematopsis villosa subsp. oliveri, commonly known as the hairy clematopsis, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves with a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
