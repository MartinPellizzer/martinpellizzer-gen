    "intro": "Cereus multangularis var. prolifer, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to South America. It features a branching structure with sharp, spiny stems that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white, night-blooming flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is well-suited for cultivation in dry climates and requires minimal watering."
