    "intro": "Cotyledon glandulosa, commonly known as the woolly cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers during the warmer months, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its succulent nature allows it to store water in its leaves, making it drought-tolerant. Cotyledon glandulosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique texture and colorful blooms."
