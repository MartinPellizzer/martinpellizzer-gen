    "intro": "Chaenostoma corymbosum, commonly known as the clustered water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant features floating leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in the summer months. Chaenostoma corymbosum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
