    "intro": "Cyperus monoflorus, commonly known as the single-flower flatsedge, is a monocot native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Cyperus monoflorus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
