    "intro": "Corymbia hylandii, commonly known as the red gum, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the coastal regions of southern Australia, particularly in Western Australia. The tree is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in winter, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and adaptability to various soil types."
