    "intro": "Carregnoa humilis, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on coniferous trees such as pines and firs. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are toxic to animals and humans. It is native to the western United States and parts of Mexico, often found in mountainous regions. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, contributing to the ecological dynamics of forest ecosystems."
