    "intro": "Cereus sonorensis, commonly known as the Sonoran Moon cactus, is a flowering cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and striking white or pink flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It produces a single, large, spiny fruit that contains edible seeds. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and botanical gardens."
