    "intro": "Capparis sprucei, commonly known as the spruce\u2019s caper, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. It is a shrub that typically grows in mountainous regions, often in rocky or forested areas. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by round, greenish fruits. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly waxy texture, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Capparis sprucei is part of the Capparaceae family, which includes other caper species known for their edible flowers and fruits."
