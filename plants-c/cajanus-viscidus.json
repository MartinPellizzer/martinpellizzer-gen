    "intro": "Cajanus viscidus, commonly known as sticky cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor agricultural conditions. Cajanus viscidus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
