    "intro": "Cyperus prolifer var. isocladus, commonly known as the spreading flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and slender, flowering stems. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, along stream banks, and in disturbed sites. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in clusters. This variant is distinguished by its prostrate growth habit and isocladous branching pattern, which sets it apart from other Cyperus species."
