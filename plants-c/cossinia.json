    "intro": "Cossinia, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that typically feature yellow or orange centers surrounded by white or pink petals. Cossinia species are often found in grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. The genus includes several species, such as Cossinia caerulea and Cossinia sphaerocarpa, which are valued for their hardiness and beauty."
