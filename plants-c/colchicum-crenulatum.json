    "intro": "Colchicum crenulatum, commonly known as the crested colchicum, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, and often hairy leaves, which are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink or red, typically blooming in late summer. Its bulbs contain toxic alkaloids, making it important to handle with care. Colchicum crenulatum thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in alpine or woodland habitats."
