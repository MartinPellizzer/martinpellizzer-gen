    "intro": "Cystopteris scandicina, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and often form dense colonies, allowing it to spread easily. The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
