The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often in marshes, bogs, or along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-ranked flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
