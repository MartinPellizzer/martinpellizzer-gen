    "intro": "Cosmibuena latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cosmos, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom throughout the dry season. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscaped gardens."
