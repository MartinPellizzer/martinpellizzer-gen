    "intro": "Conyza glabrata, commonly known as roughleaf fleabane, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open areas such as fields and roadsides, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Conyza glabrata has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it a common weed in disturbed soils."
