    "intro": "Cladocolea oligantha, commonly known as the slender cliff heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, urn-shaped flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to rocky or sandy coastal habitats. Its leaves are leathery and densely packed, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Cladocolea oligantha is often found in association with other endemic flora in its native range."
