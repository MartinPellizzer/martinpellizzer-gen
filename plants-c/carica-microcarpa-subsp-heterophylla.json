    "intro": "Carica microcarpa subsp. heterophylla, commonly known as the dwarf papaya, is a small, tropical plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that vary in size and shape depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that are typically borne in clusters, followed by small, round fruits. Its botanical features make it distinct from the more common papaya species, Carica papaya. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in small quantities."
