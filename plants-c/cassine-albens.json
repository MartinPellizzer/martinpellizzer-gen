    "intro": "Cassine albens, commonly known as white-leaf cassine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Meliaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often whitish or grayish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Cassine albens is often found in moist, lowland areas and can grow as a shrub or small tree. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
