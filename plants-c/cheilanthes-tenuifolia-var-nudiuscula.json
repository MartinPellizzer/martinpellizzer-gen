    "intro": "Cheilanthes tenuifolia var. nudiuscula, commonly known as the slender lady fern, is a terrestrial fern species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a thin layer of white, powdery spores. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is often found growing on limestone or granite outcrops. Its rhizomes are short and compact, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices and withstand harsh environmental conditions. This variety is distinguished by its reduced, often scale-like leaves on the sterile fronds, giving it a unique appearance compared to other ferns in the genus."
