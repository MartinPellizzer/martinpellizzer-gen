    "intro": "Caltha palustris f. gigas, commonly known as the giant marsh marigold, is a striking perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often emerging through snow-covered ground. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. While it is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, it differs from the typical C. palustris by its notably larger size and more robust floral display."
