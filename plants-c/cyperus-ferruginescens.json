    "intro": "Cyperus ferruginescens, commonly known as the rusty flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common colonizer of disturbed wetland habitats. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
