    "intro": "Campylocentrum carlos-parrae, commonly known as the Carlos Parra's starfruit, is a rare and unique member of the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its striking, star-shaped fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, while the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
