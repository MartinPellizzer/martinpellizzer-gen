    "intro": "Calvoa jacques-felixii, commonly known as the Jacques-F\u00e9lix's calvoa, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and restricted distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status remains uncertain."
