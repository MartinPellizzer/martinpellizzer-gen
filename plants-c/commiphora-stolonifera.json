    "intro": "Commiphora stolonifera, commonly known as the African frankincense tree, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces a resinous sap that has been historically used for medicinal and aromatic purposes. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clumps or mats."
