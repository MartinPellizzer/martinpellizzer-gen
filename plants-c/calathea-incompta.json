    "intro": "Calathea incompta, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with intricate patterns of green, silver, and pink. The leaves are oval to heart-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its vibrant appearance. The plant is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
