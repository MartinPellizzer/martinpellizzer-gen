    "intro": "Cereus hexagonus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cacti species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night and remain open for only one night. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Cereus hexagonus is well-suited for cultivation in warm climates with minimal water requirements."
