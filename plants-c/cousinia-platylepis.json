    "intro": "Cousinia platylepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features robust, hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cousinia platylepis is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability."
