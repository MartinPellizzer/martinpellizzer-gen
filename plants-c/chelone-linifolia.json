    "intro": "Chelone linifolia, commonly known as the white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, often hairy leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and prefers partial to full shade. Its flowers are tubular and have a distinctive, somewhat bell-like shape, which aids in pollination by insects. Chelone linifolia is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
