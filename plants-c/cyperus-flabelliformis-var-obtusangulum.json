It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a fan-like pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure makes it adaptable to waterlogged soils, contributing to its role in wetland ecosystems."
