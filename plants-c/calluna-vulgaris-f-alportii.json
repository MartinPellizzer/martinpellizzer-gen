    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris f. alportii, commonly known as the Alport's heather, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the Scottish Highlands. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, acidic conditions."
