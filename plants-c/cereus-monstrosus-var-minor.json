    "intro": "Cereus monstrosus var. minor, commonly known as the miniature night bloomer, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that open at night, a trait typical of many night-blooming cacti. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
