    "intro": "Corynephorus barcinonensis, commonly known as the Barcino grass, is a species of grass native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
