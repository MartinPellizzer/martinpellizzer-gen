    "intro": "Ctenopteris pilosissima, commonly known as the hairy sea palm, is a species of fern native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, bushy fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates near the shoreline. Its fronds can reach lengths of up to two meters, and they are typically divided into numerous narrow, feather-like segments. Ctenopteris pilosissima plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
