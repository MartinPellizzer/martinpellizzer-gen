    "intro": "Carex acuta f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender spike sedge, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a deep green, with a dense cluster of spikelets at the top of the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are followed by triangular, spike-like fruits. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in wet conditions. This variety is distinguished by its slender form and is a popular choice for water garden or bog landscaping."
