    "intro": "Camarotis costulata, commonly known as the zigzagged fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that often have a zigzag or undulating appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, narrow segments that give it a lacy texture. Camarotis costulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
