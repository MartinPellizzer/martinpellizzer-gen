    "intro": "Cerastium semidecandrum var. strictum, commonly known as the upright mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Its botanical name reflects its floral structure, with \"semidecandrum\" indicating a partially decussate (crossing) arrangement of flowers."
