    "intro": "Cornus virginiana, commonly known as red osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its showy white flowers that appear in clusters in early spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. Its distinctive red twigs, which stand out in winter, make it a popular ornamental plant. Cornus virginiana thrives in moist soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest edges."
