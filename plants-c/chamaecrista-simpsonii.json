It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces elongated, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes."
