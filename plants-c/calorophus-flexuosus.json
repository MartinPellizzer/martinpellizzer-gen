    "intro": "Calorophus flexuosus, commonly known as the flexible fireweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Onagraceae. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that can curl and twist, giving it a unique, almost whimsical appearance. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Native to arctic and alpine regions, it thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its adaptability to harsh climates makes it an important species in ecological studies of cold ecosystems."
