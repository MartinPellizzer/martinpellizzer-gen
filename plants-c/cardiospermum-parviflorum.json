It belongs to the family Leguminosae, characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features palmately lobed leaves and produces small, white or pink flowers that attract pollinators. Its fruit, a hairy pod, contains seeds enclosed in a heart-shaped structure, giving it its common name. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique seed pods."
