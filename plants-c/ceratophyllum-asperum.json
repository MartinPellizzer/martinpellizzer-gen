    "intro": "Ceratophyllum asperum, commonly known as spiked water-milkweed, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, branching stems covered with small, spiny structures that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a slightly serrated edge. Ceratophyllum asperum is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches."
