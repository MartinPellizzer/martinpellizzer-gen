    "intro": "Coelostegia griffithii f. sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran coelostegia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the rainforests of Sumatra. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it has opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
