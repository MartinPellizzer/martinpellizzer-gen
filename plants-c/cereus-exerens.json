    "intro": "Cereus exerens, commonly known as the desert night bloomer, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant's unique blooming behavior and striking appearance make it a popular specimen among cactus enthusiasts."
