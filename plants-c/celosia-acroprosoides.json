    "intro": "Celosia acroprosoides, commonly known as the flame flower or crown of thorns, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, spiky bracts that resemble flames or spikes, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked in favor of its showy bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its drought tolerance and ability to grow in poor soils contribute to its adaptability in various climates."
