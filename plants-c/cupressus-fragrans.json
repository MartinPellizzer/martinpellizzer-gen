    "intro": "Cupressus fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant cypress, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage and aromatic resinous scent, which is particularly noticeable when the foliage is crushed. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and can reach heights of up to 30 meters, forming a tall, slender tree with a narrow, conical shape. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. The fragrant cypress is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
