    "intro": "Caralluma adenensis, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments by storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Its flowers are typically pale purple or white, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but may be consumed by certain animals. Caralluma adenensis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
