    "intro": "Collabium simplex, commonly known as the simple collabium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Collabium simplex is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
