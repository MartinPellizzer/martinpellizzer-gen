    "intro": "Cyperus albomarginatus var. tenuis, commonly known as slender flatsedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and wetlands. Its leaves are often narrow and may have a slightly hairy texture, while the flowers are inconspicuous and clustered in spikelets. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
