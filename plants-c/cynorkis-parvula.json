    "intro": "Cynorkis parvula, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a small, slow-growing cycad native to southern Africa. It features a short, stout trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
