    "intro": "Chlorocharis palustris, commonly known as the swamp sunflower, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers with reflexed petals that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Chlorocharis palustris plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
