    "intro": "Calligonum tetrapterum var. saissanicum, commonly known as the Saharan spurge, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils. This species plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
