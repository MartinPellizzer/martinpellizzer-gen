    "intro": "Coronilla thymifolia, commonly known as thyme-leaved crownvetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features trifoliate leaves that resemble those of thyme, with a fragrant, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and making it a useful plant for erosion control. Coronilla thymifolia is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, enriching the soil in which it grows."
