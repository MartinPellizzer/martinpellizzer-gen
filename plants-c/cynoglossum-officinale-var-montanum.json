    "intro": "Cynoglossum officinale var. montanum, commonly known as mountain mouse-ear, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often glandular and have a distinctive blue or purplish hue. The plant produces small, violet to blue flowers arranged in a loose cluster, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. This variety is closely related to the common mouse-ear (Cynoglossum officinale) but is distinguished by its more compact growth and specific geographic distribution."
