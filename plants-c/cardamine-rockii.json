    "intro": "Cardamine rockii, commonly known as the Korean water shield, is a small herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces distinctive, elongated seed pods. Cardamine rockii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with damp soil conditions."
