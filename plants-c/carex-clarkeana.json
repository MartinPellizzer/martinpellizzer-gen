    "intro": "Carex clarkeana, commonly known as Clarke's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and a dense cluster of spike-like inflorescences. Native to regions of Asia, including China and the Himalayas, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, typically green or brown, which develop into three-angled berries. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streams, contributing to ecological diversity in these habitats."
