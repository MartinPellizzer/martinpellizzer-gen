    "intro": "Cereus maxonii, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its unique appearance, with a vividly colored upper portion and a green, stem-like base. The plant produces night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance requirements and striking visual contrast. The base of the plant, known as the \"pseudostem,\" is actually a grafted segment that allows the plant to thrive in various conditions."
