    "intro": "Cocculus virgatus, commonly known as the Virgin's bean, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It produces distinctive, helmet-shaped fruits that are often used in traditional herbal medicine. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and emits a strong, unpleasant odor when crushed. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The seeds within its fruit are encased in a hard, ridged shell."
