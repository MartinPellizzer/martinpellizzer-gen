    "intro": "Cereus ambiguus var. strictior, commonly known as the strict cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that grow in a compact, shrub-like form. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
