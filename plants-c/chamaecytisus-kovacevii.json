    "intro": "Chamaecytisus kovacevii, commonly known as the Kovacevii buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Balkans, specifically northern Greece and southern Albania. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal or rocky garden settings. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
