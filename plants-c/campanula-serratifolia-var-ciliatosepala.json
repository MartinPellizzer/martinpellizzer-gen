    "intro": "Campanula serratifolia var. ciliatosepala, commonly known as the serrated bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems with lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its sepals are ciliate, meaning they have fine hairs along their margins, giving it its specific variety name. This species is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and adaptability to well-drained soils."
