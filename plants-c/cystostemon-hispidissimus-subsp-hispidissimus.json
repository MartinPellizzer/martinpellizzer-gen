    "intro": "Cystostemon hispidissimus subsp. hispidissimus, commonly known as the hairy cystostemon, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, hairy foliage that provides protection against herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
