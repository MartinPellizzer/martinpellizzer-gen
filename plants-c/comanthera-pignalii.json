    "intro": "Comanthera pignalii, commonly known as the Pinal Desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Comanthera pignalii plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for native wildlife."
