It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.
