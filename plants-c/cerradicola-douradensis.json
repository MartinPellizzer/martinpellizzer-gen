    "intro": "Cerradicola douradensis, commonly known as the Douradense cypress, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Brazil. It belongs to the Cupressaceae family and is characterized by its unique, narrow leaves and conical shape. The plant thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is typically found in forested areas. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and ecological role within its native habitat. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
