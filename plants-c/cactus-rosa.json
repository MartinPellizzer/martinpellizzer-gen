    "intro": "Cactus rosa, commonly known as the rose cactus, is a unique hybrid plant that combines characteristics of cacti and roses. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in warm, arid climates. The plant features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water and spiny or woolly structures for protection. Its flowers are typically vibrant and fragrant, resembling those of traditional roses. Despite its name, it is not a true rose but a member of the Cactaceae family."
