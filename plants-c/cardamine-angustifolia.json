    "intro": "Cardamine angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant has delicate, alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Its small white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring. The plant is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
