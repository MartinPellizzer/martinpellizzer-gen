    "intro": "Cyclosorus lanosus, commonly known as the hairy cyclosorus, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth and the presence of a distinct, lobed thallus covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. It is often found on soil or rock surfaces where it can absorb moisture effectively. Due to its delicate structure, it plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides microhabitats for other small organisms."
