    "intro": "Centrolepis alepyroides, commonly known as the African clubmoss, is a unique member of the Lepidoziaceae family. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. Native to southern Africa, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant botanical interest."
