    "intro": "Cyathea schlechtendalii, commonly known as the Schlechtendal's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, trunk-like stem covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rhyzome. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Cyathea schlechtendalii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
