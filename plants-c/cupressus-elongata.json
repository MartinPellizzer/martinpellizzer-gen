    "intro": "Cupressus elongata, commonly known as the narrowleaf cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, columnar form and dense, scale-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in crossed pairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green cones, which are typically found in clusters at the branch tips. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. The narrowleaf cypress is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
