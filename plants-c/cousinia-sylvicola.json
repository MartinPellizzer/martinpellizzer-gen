    "intro": "Cousinia sylvicola, commonly known as the mountain cousinia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a compact cluster, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Cousinia sylvicola is often found in meadows and slopes at high elevations, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
