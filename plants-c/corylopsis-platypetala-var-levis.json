It features fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its early blooming habit and attractive foliage."
