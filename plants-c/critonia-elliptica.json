    "intro": "Critonia elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf critonia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
