    "intro": "Carex praecox subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many sedges. It thrives in full to partial sun and is often found in marshy areas, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
