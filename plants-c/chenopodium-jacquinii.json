It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has alternate, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Its seeds are edible and have been traditionally used by Indigenous peoples for food and medicinal purposes. Chenopodium jacquinii is also valued for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its potential role in sustainable agriculture."
