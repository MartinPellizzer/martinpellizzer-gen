    "intro": "Coelogyne formosa, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers that bloom in a loose raceme, often resembling a cascade of delicate blossoms. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Coelogyne formosa is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients. Its unique appearance and fragrance make it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and botanical study."
