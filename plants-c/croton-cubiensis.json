    "intro": "Croton cubiensis, commonly known as the Cuban croton, is a shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its diverse morphology and often milky sap. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture and can produce small, yellowish flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal. Croton cubiensis is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
