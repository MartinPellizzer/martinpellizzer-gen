    "intro": "Cecropia lanciloba, commonly known as the long-stalked cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Cecropiaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and striking, pendulous inflorescences. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with certain species of azobacteria, which fix atmospheric nitrogen in its root nodules. Its hollow stems and rapid growth make it an important component of secondary forests and a valuable resource for local communities. The plant's ability to thrive in disturbed habitats contributes to its ecological significance in tropical ecosystems."
