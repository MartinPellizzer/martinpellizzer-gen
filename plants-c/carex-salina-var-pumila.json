    "intro": "Carex salina var. pumila, commonly known as salt marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to withstand salt spray and waterlogged soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are pollinated by wind. This variety is important for stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
