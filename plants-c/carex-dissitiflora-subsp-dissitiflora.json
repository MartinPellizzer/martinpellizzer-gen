    "intro": "Carex dissitiflora subsp. dissitiflora, commonly known as the soft-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage. Its inflorescence consists of two distinct spikelets, with the lower one being longer and more robust. The plant is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
