    "intro": "Cleyera fortunei, commonly known as the Chinese holly, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Cleyera fortunei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
