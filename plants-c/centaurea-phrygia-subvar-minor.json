It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm. The plant features bright yellow flowers surrounded by pale blue or white ray florets, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
