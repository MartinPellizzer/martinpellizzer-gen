    "intro": "Caralluma dicapuae subsp. ukambensis, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, a characteristic adaptation to minimize water loss. It is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xerophytic gardens."
