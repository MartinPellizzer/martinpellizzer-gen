    "intro": "Cnicus nidulans, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with pale green, woolly leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, and the plant produces small, spiky fruits that are dispersed by wind. Cnicus nidulans is sometimes considered a weed but can also serve as a habitat for various invertebrates."
