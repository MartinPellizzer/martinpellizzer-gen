    "intro": "Cardamine cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf watercress, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in cool, damp conditions and is often found in stream banks, woodland floors, and rocky crevices. Due to its ornamental value and edible leaves, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wildflower habitats."
