    "intro": "Cactus americanus, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, called a tunas, is edible and contains a sweet, juicy pulp. Cactus americanus plays an important role in desert ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
