It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning. Chorisochora thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small insects and birds."
