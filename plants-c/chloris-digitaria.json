    "intro": "Chloris digitaria, commonly known as flatseam grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, flat leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Chloris digitaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
