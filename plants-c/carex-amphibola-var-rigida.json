    "intro": "Carex amphibola var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid swamp sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers. This variant is distinguished by its stiff, rigid leaves compared to the more flexible leaves of the typical Carex amphibola. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
