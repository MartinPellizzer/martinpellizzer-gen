    "intro": "Carex olivacea subsp. confertiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along streambanks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Its flowers are small and wind-pollinated, typical of the Cyperaceae family. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
