    "intro": "Cedrela longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf cedrela, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored wood and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an important species for reforestation efforts."
