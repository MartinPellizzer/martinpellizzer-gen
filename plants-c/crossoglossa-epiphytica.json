    "intro": "Crossoglossa epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic orchid, is a tropical plant that grows on the surface of other plants, typically in humid and shaded environments. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its aerial roots that absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale pink. It is native to regions in South America, particularly in the Amazon rainforest, where it thrives in the canopy of tall trees. Due to its unique growth habit and ornamental flowers, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
