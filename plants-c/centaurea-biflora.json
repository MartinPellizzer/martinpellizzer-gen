    "intro": "Centaurea biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers bloom from late spring to early summer. Centaurea biflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal medicine."
