    "intro": "Caucalis scandix, commonly known as the climbing bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, twining stems that allow it to climb and spread along other vegetation. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Caucalis scandix thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
