    "intro": "Cynoglossum littorale, commonly known as sea hound, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in maritime environments. Its adaptations include salt tolerance and the ability to withstand strong winds and wave action. Cynoglossum littorale plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
