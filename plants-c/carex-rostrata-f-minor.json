    "intro": "Carex rostrata f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf rostrate sedge, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy, with a dense rosette growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, or along stream banks. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover in waterlogged environments."
