    "intro": "Centaurea scabiosa var. cephalariifolia, commonly known as the scabious centaury, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking, spiky flower heads that are typically pink to purple in color. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bract-like structures that surround the central flower cluster. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and wildflower meadows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
