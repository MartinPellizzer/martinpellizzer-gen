    "intro": "Cereus colubrinus var. smaragdiflorus, commonly known as the Emerald Flower Cereus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of striking emerald-green flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening only for a few hours before closing. It is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance."
