    "intro": "Campanula erysimoides, commonly known as the rock campanula, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and are covered with a fine layer of white hairs. Campanula erysimoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to challenging garden conditions."
