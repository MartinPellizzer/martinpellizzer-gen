    "intro": "Caesalpinia ventricosa, commonly known as the Crown-of-Thorns, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, thorny stems and compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers that are clustered in dense, raceme-like inflorescences. Its fruit is a long, thin pod that splits open to release seeds. Caesalpinia ventricosa is drought-tolerant and often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
