    "intro": "Carex hondae, commonly known as Hondan sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to the Caribbean, specifically the island of Hispaniola, where it grows in wetland and swampy habitats. The plant is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native wetlands and provides habitat for various small organisms. Due to habitat loss, Carex hondae is considered endangered and is of conservation concern."
