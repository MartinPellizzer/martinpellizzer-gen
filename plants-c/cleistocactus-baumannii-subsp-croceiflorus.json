    "intro": "Cleistocactus baumannii subsp. croceiflorus, commonly known as the golden flowered cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular stem that is typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, a feature that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Its spines are short and sparse, providing minimal protection but allowing for better light penetration. This subspecies is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and tolerating high temperatures."
