    "intro": "Cerasus caproniana var. gobetta, commonly known as the Gobetta cherry, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, dark red to black fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with dense foliage, making it suitable for small gardens or rockeries. Its flowers, which appear in early spring, are pale pink and clustered, adding ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
