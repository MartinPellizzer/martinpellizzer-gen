    "intro": "Calamagrostis decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive reed, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery plumes that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that becomes more pronounced in the fall. Calamagrostis decipiens is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
