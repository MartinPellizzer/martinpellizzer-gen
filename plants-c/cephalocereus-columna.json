    "intro": "Cephalocereus columna, commonly known as the columnar cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant features prominent areoles, from which spines, flowers, and later fruits develop. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, opening at night and attracting nocturnal pollinators. The fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains edible seeds, contributing to its ecological and horticultural significance."
