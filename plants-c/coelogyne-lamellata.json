    "intro": "Coelogyne lamellata, commonly known as the crested orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often variegated foliage and fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its flowers typically range in color from white to pink and yellow, with a distinctive crested or wavy pattern on the petals. Coelogyne lamellata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
