    "intro": "Cnicus tuberosus, commonly known as the Jerusalem artichoke, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, leafy stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in the autumn. The plant produces edible tubers that are rich in inulin, a prebiotic fiber, and have a slightly sweet, nutty flavor. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its roots can grow quite deep in the soil. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
