    "intro": "Cyclosorus morobensis, commonly known as the Morobe cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like fronds that float on the water's surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures are borne on the fronds, with sporangia clustered in sori along the leaf margins. Cyclosorus morobensis plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its native wetland ecosystems."
