It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, sweet, and edible fruits known as cherries, which are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil. Cerasus pectinata is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Japanese culture and cuisine."
