    "intro": "Caperonia palustris var. inflata, commonly known as the inflated marsh cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. Its distinctive inflated, bladder-like fruit is a key identifying feature, often containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
