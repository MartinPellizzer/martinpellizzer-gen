    "intro": "Convallaria angulosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lily of the valley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Convallariaceae and is characterized by its clustered, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of its more common relative, Convallaria majalis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The flowers are white and emit a subtle fragrance, making it a notable ornamental plant in gardens."
