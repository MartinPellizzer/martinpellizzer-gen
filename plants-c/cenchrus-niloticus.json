    "intro": "Cenchrus niloticus, commonly known as the Nile grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshy areas or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it can become invasive in certain regions."
