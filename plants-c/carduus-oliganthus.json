    "intro": "Carduus oliganthus, commonly known as the lesser thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
