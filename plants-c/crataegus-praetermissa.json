    "intro": "Crataegus praetermissa, commonly known as the nodding hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red berries in the fall. The plant has simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces thorned branches, which are typical features of the Crataegus genus. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. The nodding hawthorn is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
