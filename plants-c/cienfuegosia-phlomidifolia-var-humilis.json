    "intro": "Cienfuegosia phlomidifolia var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf cienfuegosia, is a low-growing shrub native to the Caribbean region. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
