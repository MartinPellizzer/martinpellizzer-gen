    "intro": "Croton tenellus, commonly known as the dwarf croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, variegated leaves that display shades of green, yellow, and red. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens with suitable conditions."
