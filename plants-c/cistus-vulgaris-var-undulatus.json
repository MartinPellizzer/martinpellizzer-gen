    "intro": "Cistus vulgaris var. undulatus, commonly known as the undulating rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and showy pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique leaf shape, with undulating margins, distinguishes it from other cistus species."
