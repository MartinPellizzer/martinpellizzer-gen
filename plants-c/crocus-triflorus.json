    "intro": "Crocus triflorus, commonly known as the three-flowered crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It produces striking violet-blue flowers with three petals, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has a short, sturdy stem and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Crocus triflorus is also valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to naturalize over time."
