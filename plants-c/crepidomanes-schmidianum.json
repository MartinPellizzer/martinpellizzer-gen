    "intro": "Crepidomanes schmidianum, commonly known as the Schmid's bladderwrack, is a marine\u8910\u85fb (brown algae) belonging to the family Fucaceae. It is characterized by its dark brown, leathery thallus that grows in dense mats on rocky substrates in intertidal zones. The plant exhibits a filamentous structure with a central axis and lateral branches, and it produces distinctive, bladder-like air bladders that aid in buoyancy. It thrives in cold, temperate coastal waters and is often found in the North Atlantic and North Pacific regions. Crepidomanes schmidianum plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
