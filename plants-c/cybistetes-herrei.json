    "intro": "Cybistetes herrei, commonly known as the Herrei's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant, and brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, thriving in cool and moist environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin soil layers found in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cybistetes herrei is considered a conservation concern."
