    "intro": "Cardia filiformis, commonly known as the slender heartweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in wetlands. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in riparian areas. Cardia filiformis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions across Asia and Africa."
