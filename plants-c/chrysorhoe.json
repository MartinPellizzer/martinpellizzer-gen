    "intro": "Chrysorhoe, commonly known as the goldenrod, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are characterized by their showy, yellow to orange inflorescences. Chrysorhoe species typically have lance-shaped leaves and produce small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. They are often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value and ecological benefits."
