    "intro": "Cynosurus durus, commonly known as the hard bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Cynosurus durus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
