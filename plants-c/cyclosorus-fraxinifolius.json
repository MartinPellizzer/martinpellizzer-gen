    "intro": "Cyclosorus fraxinifolius, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, helping to stabilize stream banks and prevent erosion. The fronds are usually bright yellow to golden in color, making it a striking addition to water gardens."
