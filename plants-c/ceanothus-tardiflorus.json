    "intro": "Ceanothus tardiflorus, commonly known as the late-flowering ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or coastal environments. Its leaves are typically dark green and leathery, providing year-round structure. Ceanothus tardiflorus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in its native habitat."
