    "intro": "Cerastium velutinum var. villosissimum, commonly known as the downy mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for erosion control and as a ground cover in garden settings."
