    "intro": "Cortusa pekinensis, commonly known as the Peking bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, mounding growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
