    "intro": "Castanopsis microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved tanoak, is a species of evergreen tree native to the temperate rainforests of southern Japan and northern Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are usually green or reddish in color, followed by edible, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in association with other rainforest species. The bark of Castanopsis microphylla is thick and fissured, providing a distinctive appearance and offering some resistance to pests and diseases."
