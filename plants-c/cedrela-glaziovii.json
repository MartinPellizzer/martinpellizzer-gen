    "intro": "Cedrela glaziovii, commonly known as Glaziov\u2019s ceiba, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The tree produces woody, elongated fruits that contain flat, winged seeds. It is often found in moist lowland forests and is valued for its durable, heavy timber. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
