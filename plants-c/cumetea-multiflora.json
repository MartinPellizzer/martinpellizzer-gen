    "intro": "Cumetea multiflora, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptic in shape and covered with a fine, silvery bloom. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
