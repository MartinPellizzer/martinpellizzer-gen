    "intro": "Cyrtandra kamoolaensis, commonly known as the Kamoolan heliconia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near streams or in mountainous regions. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing nectar that attracts various pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyrtandra kamoolaensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
