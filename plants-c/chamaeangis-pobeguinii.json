    "intro": "Chamaeangis pobeguinii, commonly known as the Goualouit's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in clusters along the stem. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each new growth emerging from a basal node. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, adapting to the humid and shaded environments of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
