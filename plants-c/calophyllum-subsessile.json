It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, elliptical fruits containing a single seed.

Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
