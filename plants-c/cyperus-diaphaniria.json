It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or aquatic environments, thriving in moist soils and shallow water. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often submerged or floating, adapted for water dispersal.
