    "intro": "Calamagrostis salina, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to saline and coastal environments. The plant thrives in sandy or muddy soils and is often found in tidal marshes and salt flats. Its small, inconspicuous flowers appear in summer and are arranged in loose panicles. Calamagrostis salina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
