    "intro": "Convallaria majalis var. montana, commonly known as the mountain lily or white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky slopes. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for use in gardens where children or pets are present."
