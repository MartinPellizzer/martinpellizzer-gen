    "intro": "Coelogyne dulitensis, commonly known as the Dullitensis orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies. Its pseudobulbs are thick and store water, helping it survive in its natural habitat. Coelogyne dulitensis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
