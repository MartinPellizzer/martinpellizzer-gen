    "intro": "Cephalocereus glaucochrous, commonly known as the blue-green cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are covered in a dense layer of blue-gray spines. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system to access water in arid environments. This cactus is well adapted to desert conditions and requires minimal water once established."
