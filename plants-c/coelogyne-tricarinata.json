It is characterized by its striking, fragrant, and often brightly colored flowers that bloom in winter or early spring. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with varying rainfall. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Coelogyne tricarinata is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and unique floral structure."
