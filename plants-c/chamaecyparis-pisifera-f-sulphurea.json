    "intro": "Chamaecyparis pisifera f. sulphurea, commonly known as the golden cypress, is a rare and striking variant of the Japanese white cedar. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage that displays a vibrant golden-yellow color, especially in full sun. The plant has a compact, columnar growth habit and produces small, inconspicuous blue-gray cones. It is native to Japan and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections for its unique coloration and slow growth rate."
