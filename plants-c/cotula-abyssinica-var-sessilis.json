    "intro": "Cotula abyssinica var. sessilis, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling daisies. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Cotula abyssinica var. sessilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
