    "intro": "Campylochnella angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed campylochnella, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, white or pale yellow blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
