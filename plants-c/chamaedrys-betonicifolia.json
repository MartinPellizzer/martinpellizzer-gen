    "intro": "Chamaedrys betonicifolia, commonly known as the alpine betony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Chamaedrys betonicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
