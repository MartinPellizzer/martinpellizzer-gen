    "intro": "Ceanothus greggii subsp. vestitus, commonly known as the silverleaf ceanothus, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, soft, woolly hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This subspecies is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
