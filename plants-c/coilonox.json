    "intro": "Coilonox, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval, woody fruits containing several seeds. Coilonox is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
