    "intro": "Callerya scandens, commonly known as the climbing hibiscus, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems that climb or trail along the ground, often forming dense thickets. The plant produces showy, hibiscus-like flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy, dark green surface. Callerya scandens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and continuous flowering."
