    "intro": "Cissus egestosa, commonly known as the Indian snowball vine, is a climbing plant native to southern Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for vertical gardening and trellis coverage."
