    "intro": "Cerasus pendula floreroseo, commonly known as the rose-flowered cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous clusters of pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plant has simple, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly serrated margin. Its fruit is a small, reddish-pink cherry that ripens in summer. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often used in gardens and landscapes."
