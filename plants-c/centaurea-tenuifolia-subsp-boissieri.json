    "intro": "Centaurea tenuifolia subsp. boissieri, commonly known as the narrowleaf centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
