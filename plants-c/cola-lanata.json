    "intro": "Cola lanata, commonly known as the hairy cola or woolly cola, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to western Africa, where it grows in tropical rainforests and humid environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of caffeine. Cola lanata is closely related to other cola species, such as Cola acuminata and Cola nitida, which are also valued for their caffeine-rich seeds."
