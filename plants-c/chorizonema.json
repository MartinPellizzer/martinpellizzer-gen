    "intro": "Chorizonema, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. Chorizonema species are typically shrubs or small trees with thick, waxy leaves adapted to conserve water. They play an important role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small animals."
