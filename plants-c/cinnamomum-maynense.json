    "intro": "Cinnamomum maynense, commonly known as the Mayan cinnamon or wild cinnamon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its aromatic, elliptical leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue to black berries containing one to three seeds. Its bark and leaves contain essential oils rich in cinnamaldehyde, which contribute to its distinctive scent and medicinal properties. The tree thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests."
