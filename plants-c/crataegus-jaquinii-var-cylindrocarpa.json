It is characterized by its oval, smooth, and often thornless stems, which can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by bright red, cylindrical berries that persist into winter. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and fruiting display."
