    "intro": "Cerastium latifolium var. subacaule, commonly known as the broad-leaved mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via runners make it a common weed in disturbed soils."
