    "intro": "Cardamine flexuosa var. bracteata, commonly known as the bracted watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in waterlogged areas. This variety is closely related to other members of the Ranunculaceae family, sharing similar ecological and morphological traits."
