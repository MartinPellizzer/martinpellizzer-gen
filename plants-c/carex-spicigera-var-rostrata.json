    "intro": "Carex spicigera var. rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical spikes of small, greenish flowers. This variety is native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in environments with consistent hydration. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in aquatic ecosystems."
