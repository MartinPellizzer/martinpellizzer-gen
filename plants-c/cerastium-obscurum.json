    "intro": "Cerastium obscurum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically heart-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in gardens and disturbed soils."
