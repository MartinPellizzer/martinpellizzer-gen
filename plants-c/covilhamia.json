    "intro": "Covilhamia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. These plants are characterized by their attractive, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, and white. Covilhamia species typically have thick, waxy leaves that help them retain moisture in their native habitats. They are popular as ornamental plants due to their compact growth habit and ability to bloom year-round under proper care. The genus includes several species, such as Covilhamia glaberrima and Covilhamia thomsonii, which are often cultivated for their aesthetic appeal."
