It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in crevices. Due to its unique habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
