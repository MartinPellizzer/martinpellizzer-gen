The plant produces small, pale-colored flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along water bodies. Its botanical features make it an important species in wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy."
