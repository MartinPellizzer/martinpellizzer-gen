    "intro": "Cyperus latifolius var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and linear, with a distinct midrib. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often subtended by leaf-like bracts. It thrives in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
