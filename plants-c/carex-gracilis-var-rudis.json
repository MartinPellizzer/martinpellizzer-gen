It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-brown spikes of flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in suitable habitats. The foliage is often used in floral arrangements due to its delicate appearance and long-lasting nature."
