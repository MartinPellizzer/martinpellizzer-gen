It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained soil. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces berries that are a food source for various wildlife. Carex brachyanthera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
