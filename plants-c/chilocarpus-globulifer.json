    "intro": "Chilocarpus globulifer, commonly known as the globular pod tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and smooth, dark-barked trunk. The plant produces small, round fruits that are clustered in globose formations, giving it its common name. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a leathery texture. Chilocarpus globulifer is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and fruit structure."
