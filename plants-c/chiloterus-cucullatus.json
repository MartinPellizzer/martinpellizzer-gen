    "intro": "Chiloterus cucullatus, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, hood-like floral structure. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool and humid conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
