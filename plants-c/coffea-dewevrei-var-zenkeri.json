    "intro": "Coffea dewevrei var. zenkeri, commonly known as the Zenker's coffee, is a rare and less commonly cultivated species within the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of western Africa, particularly in countries like Cameroon and Gabon. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are elliptical and have a glossy surface. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical conservation efforts."
