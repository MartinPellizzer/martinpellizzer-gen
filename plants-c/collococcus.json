    "intro": "Collococcus, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. These plants are characterized by their dense, velvety foliage and showy, clustered flowers that come in a variety of colors. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Collococcus species are popular houseplants due to their compact size and ability to thrive in indoor conditions. They prefer bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
