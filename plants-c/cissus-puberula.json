    "intro": "Cissus puberula, commonly known as the silver vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The leaves are typically alternate and have a velvety texture, which contributes to its common name. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. This plant is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
