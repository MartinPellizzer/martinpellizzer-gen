    "intro": "Chrysanthemum webbianum, commonly known as the rock chrysanthemum, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Chrysanthemum webbianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
