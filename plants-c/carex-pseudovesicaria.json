    "intro": "Carex pseudovesicaria, commonly known as the bladder sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are generally narrow and cylindrical, with a smooth surface and a prominent midrib. The flowers are usually wind-pollinated, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
