It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has hairy, spreading stems and leaves that are opposite and often covered in fine\u7ed2\u6bdb. It thrives in shady, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its preference for shady conditions, with \"umbrosum\" deriving from the Latin word for shade."
