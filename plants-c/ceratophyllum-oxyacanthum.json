    "intro": "Ceratophyllum oxyacanthum, commonly known as the spiked watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to parts of Africa. It has feathery, branching stems that are often covered with small, sharp spines, giving it its common name. The plant produces tiny, floating flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Ceratophyllum oxyacanthum is often used in water gardens for its ornamental value and ability to help control algae growth."
