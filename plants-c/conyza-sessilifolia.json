    "intro": "Conyza sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessileleaf fleabane, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and the leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks. Conyza sessilifolia is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments."
