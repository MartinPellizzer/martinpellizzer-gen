    "intro": "Cerastium repens subsp. lineare, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy, kidney-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its stems spread horizontally, often rooting at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
