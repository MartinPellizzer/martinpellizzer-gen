    "intro": "Cotyledon umbilicus-veneris var. praealta, commonly known as the \"Queen of the Night,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or purple markings, which help it store water and protect against intense sunlight. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, usually at night, hence its common name. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming make it a popular choice for collectors and gardeners."
