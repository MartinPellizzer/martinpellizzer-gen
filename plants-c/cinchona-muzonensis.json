    "intro": "Cinchona muzonensis, commonly known as the Muzon quinine tree, is a species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain seeds, and it is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. It is notable for its historical use in the production of quinine, though its medicinal applications are less prominent today. The tree plays an important role in the biodiversity of its native habitat."
