    "intro": "Ctenopteris jamesonioides, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, clustered rhizome system that supports its massive fronds. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged in a unique, linear pattern along the undersides of the fronds. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
