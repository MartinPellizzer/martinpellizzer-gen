    "intro": "Centaurea nigra subsp. gueryi, commonly known as the Guery's blackweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which contrast with its slender, branching stems. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a grayish-green color. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
