    "intro": "Carex rupestris, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial plant native to rocky and coastal habitats in the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescence, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environments, such as cliffs and dunes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, stabilizing soil in erosion-prone areas. Carex rupestris plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
