    "intro": "Centaurea montana var. intermedia, commonly known as the Alpine blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flower heads, which are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a composite structure. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and alpine plant collections."
