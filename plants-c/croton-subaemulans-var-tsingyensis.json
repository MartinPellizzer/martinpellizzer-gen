It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, often colorful foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, often greenish-yellow, and it produces unique, spiky fruits. This variety is adapted to the limestone formations of the Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils."
