    "intro": "Cordia mirabiloides, commonly known as the beautiful cordia, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are often pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape, with a glossy green upper surface. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
