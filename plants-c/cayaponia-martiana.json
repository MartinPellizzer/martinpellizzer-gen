    "intro": "Cayaponia martiana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers. The plant is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been used historically for construction and craftsmanship. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its natural range."
