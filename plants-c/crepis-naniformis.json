    "intro": "Crepis naniformis, commonly known as the dwarf hawk's-beard, is a small flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in its often arid habitats. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that are surrounded by a series of bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture. Crepis naniformis is often found in meadows, rocky areas, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
