    "intro": "Cheilanthes aculeata, commonly known as the prickly rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features dark green, leathery fronds with spiny margins, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Cheilanthes aculeata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
