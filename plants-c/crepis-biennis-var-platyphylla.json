    "intro": "Crepis biennis var. platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved mouse-ear, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, broadly oval leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this species thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant has a short, stout stem and produces numerous small achenes as its fruit. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
