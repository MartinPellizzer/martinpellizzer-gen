    "intro": "Callitriche intermedia subsp. pedunculata, commonly known as the aquatic starwort, is a small herbaceous plant that thrives in freshwater environments. It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds, streams, and ditches, where it can receive adequate sunlight. The plant has slender, branching stems that often float on the water surface, supported by whorled leaves that are narrow and pointed. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. This subspecies is characterized by its elongated peduncles, which give it its name and distinguish it from other members of the genus."
