    "intro": "Cotoneaster glaucophyllus f. serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering cotoneaster, is a variant of the cotoneaster plant characterized by its delayed blooming period. This shrub typically features dense, compact growth with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The flowers, which appear in clusters, are usually pink or white and bloom later in the season compared to the species' typical flowering time. Its fruits are small, red berries that mature in late autumn, providing food for birds and other wildlife. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to a variety of garden conditions."
