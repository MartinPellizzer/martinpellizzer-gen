    "intro": "Calophyllum stipitatum, commonly known as the red sandalwood or black sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stems. The tree produces yellowish flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and durability, though it is also threatened by overharvesting. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, supporting various wildlife species."
