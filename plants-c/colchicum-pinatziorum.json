    "intro": "Colchicum pinatziorum, commonly known as the Alpine colchic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Colchicaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a single, nodding flower with recurved petals, typically in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
