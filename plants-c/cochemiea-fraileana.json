    "intro": "Cochemiea fraileana, commonly known as the Mexican snowball cactus, is a species of cactus native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spherical shape and its ability to produce clusters of white, woolly flowers during the spring. The plant has thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are typically short and cylindrical, and they often fall off as the plant matures. Cochemiea fraileana is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
