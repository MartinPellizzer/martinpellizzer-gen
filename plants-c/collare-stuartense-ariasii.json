    "intro": "Collare-stuartense ariasii, commonly known as the Stuart's Collared Orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, collared structure on its petals, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and pale, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
