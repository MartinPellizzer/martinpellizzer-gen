    "intro": "Ceratocapnos claviculata, commonly known as the Scottish heather, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist climates. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, dark berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Ceratocapnos claviculata plays an important role in stabilizing mountainous soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
