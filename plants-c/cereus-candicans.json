    "intro": "Cereus candicans, commonly known as the candlestick cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a smooth, green stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, typically during the warmer months. It has spiny areoles and is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. Its name reflects the candle-like appearance of its flowers, which emit a soft glow in the dark."
