    "intro": "Clerodendrum herbaceum, commonly known as the creeping clerodendrum, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are clustered in umbels, producing a striking display of pink or red blooms. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. The plant's rapid growth and spreading habit make it suitable for ground cover in suitable climates."
