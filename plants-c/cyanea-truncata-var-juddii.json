    "intro": "Cyanea truncata var. juddii, commonly known as the Judd's cyanea, is a rare Hawaiian plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and distinctive, waxy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, often with a faintly fragrant aroma. It is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands, specifically found on the island of Maui. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
