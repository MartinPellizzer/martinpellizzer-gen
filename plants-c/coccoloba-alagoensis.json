    "intro": "Coccoloba alagoensis, commonly known as the Alagoas coccoloba, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the island of Alagoas in northeastern Brazil, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a distinctive, often brightly colored appearance. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found growing in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coccoloba alagoensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
