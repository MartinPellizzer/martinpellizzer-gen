    "intro": "Cactus stella-aurata, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a unique species native to the deserts of North America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in short, white spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom in clusters at the stem tips. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to survive. Its compact size and striking appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
