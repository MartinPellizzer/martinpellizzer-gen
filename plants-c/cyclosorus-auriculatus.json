    "intro": "Cyclosorus auriculatus, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant in soft substrates. Cyclosorus auriculatus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in controlled aquatic settings."
