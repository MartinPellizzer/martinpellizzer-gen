It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and pinnate leaves with small, elliptical leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits that split open when mature. Chamaecrista xinguensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in indigenous medicine."
