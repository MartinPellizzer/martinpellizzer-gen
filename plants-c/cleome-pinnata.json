    "intro": "Cleome pinnata, commonly known as the spider flower, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, spindly stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Cleome pinnata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
