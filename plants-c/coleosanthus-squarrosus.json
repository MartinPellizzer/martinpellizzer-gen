    "intro": "Coleosanthus squarrosus, commonly known as the squarrosus sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found growing along the shoreline. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and xeriscaping."
