    "intro": "Campanula aggregata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and its root system consists of a fibrous network. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Campanula aggregata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
