    "intro": "Cyanea habenata, commonly known as the Hawaiian sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows along coastal areas and is adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cyanea habenata plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for native pollinators."
