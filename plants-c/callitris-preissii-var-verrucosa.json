It is characterized by its thick, scaly bark that provides protection against fire and drought. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spherical cones. It is well adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and poor soil conditions. This species is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
