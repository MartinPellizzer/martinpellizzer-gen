    "intro": "Crepidium comberi, commonly known as the Comber's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that can range in color from white to pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
