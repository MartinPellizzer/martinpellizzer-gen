    "intro": "Cyrtandra apiculata, commonly known as the sharp-tipped cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some horticultural collections, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
