    "intro": "Corybas \u00d7 miscellus, commonly known as the hybrid ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests. The plant is characterized by its unique, hooded flower that resembles a ghostly face, giving it its common name. It produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind, making natural propagation challenging. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
