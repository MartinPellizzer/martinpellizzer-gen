    "intro": "Cynosurus effusus, commonly known as sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, wiry stems and fine, silky leaves that give it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in loose panicles, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind. Sweetgrass is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally by various indigenous cultures for ceremonial and medicinal purposes."
