    "intro": "Carex intermedia f. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, rushes, and other grass-like plants. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical Carex intermedia. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often green or brown in color, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
