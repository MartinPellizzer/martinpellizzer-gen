    "intro": "Coussarea verticillata, commonly known as the spiral aralia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves, which give it a unique and elegant appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses. However, it is important to note that it can be invasive in certain regions if not properly managed."
