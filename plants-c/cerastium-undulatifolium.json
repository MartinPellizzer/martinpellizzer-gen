    "intro": "Cerastium undulatifolium, commonly known as the wavy-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped with a wavy margin, and the flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
