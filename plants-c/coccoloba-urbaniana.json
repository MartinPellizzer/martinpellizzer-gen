It is native to the Caribbean, particularly Trinidad and Tobago, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often lobed and have a distinctive, somewhat maple-like appearance. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found growing in moist, shaded areas. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
