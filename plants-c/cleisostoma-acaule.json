    "intro": "Cleisostoma acaule, commonly known as the naked-stemmed hooded orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, hooded flower structure and lack of a visible stem, with the flower emerging directly from the leaf axils. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually clustered at the base, and the flowers are usually green or yellowish with a distinctive hood-like lip. Cleisostoma acaule is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
