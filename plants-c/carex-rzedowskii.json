    "intro": "Carex rzedowskii, commonly known as the Rzedowskii's sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with both male and female parts present on the same plant, making it monoecious. Carex rzedowskii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
