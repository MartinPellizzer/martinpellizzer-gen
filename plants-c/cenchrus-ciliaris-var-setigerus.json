    "intro": "Cenchrus ciliaris var. setigerus, commonly known as Buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fine, wiry leaves and dense, compact growth. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species for dryland environments. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion and makes it a valuable plant for pasture and land stabilization."
