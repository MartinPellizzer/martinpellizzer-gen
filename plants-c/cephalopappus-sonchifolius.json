    "intro": "Cephalopappus sonchifolius, commonly known as the common groundsel, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of rough, hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, with ray florets surrounding disc florets. Its seeds are small, pappus-equipped, and dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
