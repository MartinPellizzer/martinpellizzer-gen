    "intro": "Convolvulus villosus var. fulcratus, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, opening in the morning and closing at dusk. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste grounds. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via runners make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
