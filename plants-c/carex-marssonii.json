    "intro": "Carex marssonii, commonly known as the Marsson's sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. Carex marssonii is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in wet conditions and support local biodiversity."
