    "intro": "Crepis stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant has small, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically yellow with five petals. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in garden beds. Crepis stolonifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
