    "intro": "Calophyllum symingtonianum, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often reddish bark and elliptical leaves. The tree produces yellowish flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing single seeds. It is valued for its fragrant wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
