    "intro": "Cassinia nivalis, commonly known as the snow cassinia, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flower heads that resemble daisies, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which disperse its seeds via wind. Cassinia nivalis thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or grassy alpine meadows. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
