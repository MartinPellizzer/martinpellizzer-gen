    "intro": "Crataegus sequax, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often thorned branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces white to pinkish flowers in spring, which are followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun to partial shade. Crataegus sequax is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to support local wildlife."
