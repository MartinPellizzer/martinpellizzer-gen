    "intro": "Chamaesyce mossambicensis, commonly known as the African carpetweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers, which are often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in coastal areas and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain environments."
