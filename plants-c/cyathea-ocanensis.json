It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soil. Its fronds can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, making it a striking feature in its natural habitat.
