    "intro": "Clematis nutans var. aethusifolia, commonly known as the hanging clematis or the nodding clematis, is a deciduous vine native to China. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and clusters of small, fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and the plant produces small, round berries that ripen to a dark blue or black color. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental vines. This variety is noted for its graceful appearance and ability to climb trellises or other supports."
