    "intro": "Cerastium consanguineum, commonly known as the common mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, rounded leaves and produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Cerastium consanguineum is often found in disturbed soils and can spread readily through self-seeding."
