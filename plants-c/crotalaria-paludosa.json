    "intro": "Crotalaria paludosa, commonly known as swamp cowpea, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded lobes. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. Crotalaria paludosa is adapted to moist, swampy environments and often grows in disturbed or saturated soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
