    "intro": "Campanula, commonly known as bellflowers, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are characterized by their bell-shaped flowers, which range in color from blue to purple and white. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas. Campanula species vary in height and growth habit, with some being annuals and others perennials. Their flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making them valuable additions to gardens and natural habitats."
