    "intro": "Cephalocereus macrocephalus, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and a distinctive crown of spines at the top. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. The plant's slow growth rate and striking appearance make it a popular choice for desert gardens and collections."
