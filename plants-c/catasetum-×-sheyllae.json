    "intro": "Catasetum \u00d7 sheyllae, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a species that results from the crossbreeding of Catasetum species, primarily C. caudatum and C. saccatum. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers with intricate structures, including specialized pollinia that are adapted for specific pollinators. Its botanical features include pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, and long, strap-like leaves. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
