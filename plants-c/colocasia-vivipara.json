    "intro": "Colocasia vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous arrowhead, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of fruit that contains numerous seeds. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native regions, impacting local ecosystems."
