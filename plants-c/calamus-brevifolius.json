    "intro": "Calamus brevifolius, commonly known as the short-leaved arrowroot, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arales. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes that produce clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is often found in wetland or swampy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are narrow and short, typically less than 10 cm in length, giving it a distinctive appearance. Calamus brevifolius is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
