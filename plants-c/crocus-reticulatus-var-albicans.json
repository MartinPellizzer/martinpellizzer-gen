It is characterized by its striking white petals and a prominent, showy flower that blooms in early spring. The plant produces a single, cup-shaped flower with a central stigma that is often more prominent than the petals. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a bulbous base. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
