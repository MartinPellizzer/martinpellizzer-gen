    "intro": "Cistus polymorphus var. corsicus, commonly known as the Corsican rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It features aromatic, evergreen foliage with leathery, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or coastal environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
