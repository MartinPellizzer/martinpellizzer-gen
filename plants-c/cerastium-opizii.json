    "intro": "Cerastium opizii, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves and a compact growth habit, making it well adapted to cold, rocky environments. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in meadows and mountainous areas. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
