    "intro": "Callistopteris calyculata, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically bright yellow to golden in color. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are simple and pinnately divided, with a leathery texture that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Callistopteris calyculata is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in other damp, forested areas."
