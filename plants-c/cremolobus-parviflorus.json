    "intro": "Cremolobus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered cremolobus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cactaceae, although it is not a true cactus, and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the early morning, often during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it relies on specific microhabitats for survival. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cremolobus parviflorus is considered a vulnerable species."
