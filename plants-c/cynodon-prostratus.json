    "intro": "Cynodon prostratus, commonly known as mat grass or flatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa. It forms dense, mat-like colonies that spread rapidly through stolons, making it highly adaptable to various soil types. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pale blue or greenish flowers in summer. It is often used for erosion control and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and rapid growth. Cynodon prostratus thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions."
