    "intro": "Carex capillaris subsp. chlorostachys, commonly known as the green-stem sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and distinctive inflorescence. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant features a dense cluster of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The leaves are usually bright green, with a smooth texture and a slightly glossy appearance."
