    "intro": "Cardamine minuta, commonly known as slender water shield, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in length, with a waxy surface to repel water. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-white in color, and appear in clusters. Cardamine minuta plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
