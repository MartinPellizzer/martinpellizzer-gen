    "intro": "Celmisia polyvena, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in rocky habitats, and it plays a role in supporting local insect populations. Celmisia polyvena is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
