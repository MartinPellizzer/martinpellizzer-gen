    "intro": "Calystegia pellita subsp. pellita, commonly known as the lesser bindweed, is a perennial vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in summer. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. This species is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
