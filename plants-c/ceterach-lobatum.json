    "intro": "Ceterach lobatum, commonly known as the coastal rock fern, is a hardy, evergreen fern native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds. The plant has a creeping rhizome with dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments. It is often found growing on coastal cliffs, dunes, and rocky outcrops. Its ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions makes it an important component of coastal vegetation."
