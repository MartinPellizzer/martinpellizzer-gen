    "intro": "Cheilanthes candida, commonly known as the white rock fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving it its common name. This plant is typically found growing on rocky outcrops and in dry, sunny environments. It has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, spore-bearing leaves called sporangia. Cheilanthes candida is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
