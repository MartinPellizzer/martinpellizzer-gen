    "intro": "Catocoma mansonii, commonly known as the Manson's catocoma, is a rare and little-known plant native to specific regions of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its unique morphological features. The plant typically grows in humid, lowland areas with well-drained soil, exhibiting a shrub-like structure with woody stems. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with distinct sepals and petals, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited study, Catocoma mansonii remains a subject of botanical interest and conservation concern."
