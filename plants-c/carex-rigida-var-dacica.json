    "intro": "Carex rigida var. dacica, commonly known as the rigid sedge. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in water filtration and habitat provision for various wildlife species."
