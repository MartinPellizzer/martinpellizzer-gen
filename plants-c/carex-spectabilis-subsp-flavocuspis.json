    "intro": "Carex spectabilis subsp. flavocuspis, commonly known as the yellow-tipped sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, with the inflorescence often displaying a yellowish tinge due to the color of the bracts. The subspecies is distinguished by its distinctive yellowish bracts that give it its common name."
