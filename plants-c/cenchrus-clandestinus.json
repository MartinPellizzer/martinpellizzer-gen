    "intro": "Cenchrus clandestinus, commonly known as the desert grass or African lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and the ability to thrive in poor soils. Cenchrus clandestinus is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant in certain regions."
