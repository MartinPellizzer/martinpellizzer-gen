    "intro": "Corydalis adiantifolia var. heterocarpa, commonly known as the heterocarpic corydalis, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fumariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the flowers are borne on slender pedicels. The varietal name \"heterocarpa\" refers to the unique structure of its fruit, which differs from the typical form seen in other varieties of Corydalis."
