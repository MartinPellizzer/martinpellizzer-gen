    "intro": "Coutaportla guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan coutaportla, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Guatemala. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, herbaceous stems and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom during the spring and summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
