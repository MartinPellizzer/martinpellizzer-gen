It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky inflorescence and bright, colorful flowers that range from red to orange. The plant belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its roots are specialized for water storage, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native habitat."
