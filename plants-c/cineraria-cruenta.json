    "intro": "Cineraria cruenta, commonly known as the blueweed or cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cineraria cruenta is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
