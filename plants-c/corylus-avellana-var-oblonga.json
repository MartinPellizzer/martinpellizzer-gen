    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. oblonga, commonly known as the European hazel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its oval-shaped nuts, which are typically enclosed in a prickly husk. The plant produces catkins in early spring, with male and female flowers appearing on separate plants. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible nuts."
