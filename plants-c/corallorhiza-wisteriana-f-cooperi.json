    "intro": "Corallorhiza wisteriana f. cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's coralroot, is a terrestrial orchid that lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for its nutrition. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a slender, branched stem and small, scale-like leaves. The flowers are typically pale yellow to orange-red, with a distinctive hooded structure and spurred petals. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and forest floors. This rare and elusive species is often difficult to locate due to its inconspicuous appearance and limited distribution."
