    "intro": "Castilleja pallida var. acuminata, commonly known as the pale castilleja with acute leaves, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its small, leafless stems are often mistaken for dead twigs, making it a cryptic species in its native environment."
