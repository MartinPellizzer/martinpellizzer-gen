    "intro": "Chrysanthemum atratum var. lithopolitanicum, commonly known as the rock chrysanthemum, is a perennial herb native to arid and rocky regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
