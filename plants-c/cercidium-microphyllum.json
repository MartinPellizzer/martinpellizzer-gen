    "intro": "Cercidium microphyllum, commonly known as the desert hackberry, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-resistant. Cercidium microphyllum plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting desert ecosystems."
