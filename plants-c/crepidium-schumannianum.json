    "intro": "Crepidium schumannianum, commonly known as the Schumacher's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features a slender rhizome with a single, erect stem that bears a few lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in a loose inflorescence, often with a subtle fragrance. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
