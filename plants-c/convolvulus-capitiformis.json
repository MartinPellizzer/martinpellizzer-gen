    "intro": "Convolvulus capitiformis, commonly known as the clustered morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of purple and blue. The plant has hairy, ascending stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and runners make it a common weed in disturbed habitats."
