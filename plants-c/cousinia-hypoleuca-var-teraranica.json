    "intro": "Cousinia hypoleuca var. teraranica, commonly known as the Teraranica globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its dense, spherical inflorescence composed of numerous small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
