    "intro": "Cryophytum stenandrum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved frost plant, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its compact growth habit and frost-resistant adaptations. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the early spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. Due to its specialized habitat, Cryophytum stenandrum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
