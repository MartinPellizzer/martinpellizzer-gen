    "intro": "Crotalaria stipitata, commonly known as the hairy crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and distinctive pod fruits. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a spurred shape, and it produces seed pods that split open when mature. Crotalaria stipitata is known for its medicinal uses in traditional medicine, though it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
