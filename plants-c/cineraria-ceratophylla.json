    "intro": "Cineraria ceratophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and poor soil."
