    "intro": "Calophyllum oliganthum, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of the Pacific. It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often reddish-brown bark and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, and the tree is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
