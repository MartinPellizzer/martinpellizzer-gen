It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in sandy or rocky environments. Coursetia virgata is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
