    "intro": "Corymbia clavigera, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that becomes more prominent with age, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, followed by woody capsules containing several seeds. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions."
