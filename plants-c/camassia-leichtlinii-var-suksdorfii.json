    "intro": "Camassia leichtlinii var. suksdorfii, commonly known as the Saksdorf camas, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its striking blue to purple floral spikes that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open meadows and woodlands. Its leaves are grass-like, forming a basal rosette, and it produces small, bell-shaped flowers arranged in racemes. This variant is distinguished by its unique floral coloration and is often found in association with other camas species in its native habitat."
