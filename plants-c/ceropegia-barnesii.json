It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its trailing stems and tubular flowers. The plant produces small, often pale yellow or greenish flowers that are adapted for specific pollinators. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Ceropegia barnesii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ease of care."
