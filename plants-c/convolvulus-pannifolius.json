    "intro": "Convolvulus pannifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to white. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its rapid growth and sprawling habit make it a common weed in disturbed areas. The genus Convolvulus includes many species with similar morphological traits, but pannifolius stands out for its distinctive foliage and adaptability."
