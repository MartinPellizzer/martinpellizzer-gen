It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, cylindrical flower clusters. This variety is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along stream edges. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
