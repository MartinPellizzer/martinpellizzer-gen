    "intro": "Carex capillacea subsp. aomorensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of East Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. This subspecies typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually wind-pollinated. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
