    "intro": "Corsia cyclopensis, commonly known as the cyclops corsia, is a unique member of the Rhamnaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Due to habitat loss, Corsia cyclopensis is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
