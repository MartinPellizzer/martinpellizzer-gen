    "intro": "Carduus \u00d7 weizensis, commonly known as the wheat thistle, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Carduus benedictus and Carduus maximus. It is characterized by its robust, spiny foliage and a tall, flowering stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, prickly fruits. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in agricultural areas but also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
