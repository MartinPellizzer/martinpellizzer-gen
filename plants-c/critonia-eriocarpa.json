    "intro": "Critonia eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly critonia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it a unique and interesting subject for study in arid ecosystems."
