It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pink to red flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb nutrients from host plants. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Castilleja hirsuta plays a role in supporting pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of its environment."
