    "intro": "Couthovia neoebudica, commonly known as the silverleaf starbloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features broad, waxy leaves that reflect sunlight, helping it thrive in its high-altitude environment. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the thin, rocky soil. Due to habitat loss, it is classified as an endangered species."
