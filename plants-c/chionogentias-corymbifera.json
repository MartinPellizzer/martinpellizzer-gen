It is characterized by its clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique floral structure, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and alpine settings."
