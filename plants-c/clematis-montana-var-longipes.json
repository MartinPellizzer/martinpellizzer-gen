    "intro": "Clematis montana var. longipes, commonly known as the longipes Clematis, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue to violet, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental climbers. Its strong, twining stems allow it to climb trellises or walls with minimal pruning."
