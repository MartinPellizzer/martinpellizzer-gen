It is characterized by its dark, almost black rhizomes and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, followed by distinctive three-sided seed capsules. Carex oreocharis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
