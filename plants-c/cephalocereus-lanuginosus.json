    "intro": "Cephalocereus lanuginosus, commonly known as the woolly cactus or the Mexican night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and the flowers can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant is adapted to withstand extreme drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
