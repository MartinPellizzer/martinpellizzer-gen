    "intro": "Callitriche autumnalis f. replicata-major, commonly known as the broad-leaved water starwort, is a variant of the water starwort species. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant features narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stems. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water's surface. This form is characterized by its larger, more broadly shaped leaves compared to the typical form of the species."
