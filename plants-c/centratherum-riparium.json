    "intro": "Centratherum riparium, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils along rivers, ponds, and ditches. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a bright green color. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in dense inflorescences, usually appearing in late spring to early summer. Centratherum riparium plays a role in stabilizing aquatic environments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
