    "intro": "Crataegus tatarica, commonly known as the Tatarian hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not consumed by humans. Crataegus tatarica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and as a hedge plant."
