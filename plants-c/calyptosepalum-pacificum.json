    "intro": "Calyptosepalum pacificum, commonly known as the Pacific calyptosepal, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its unique calyx that remains fused to the ovary, a feature that distinguishes it from many other members of the Ericaceae family. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Calyptosepalum pacificum thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments."
