    "intro": "Croton simulans, commonly known as the white croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that are often bright green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
