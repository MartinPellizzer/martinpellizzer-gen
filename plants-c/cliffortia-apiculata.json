    "intro": "Cliffortia apiculata, commonly known as the mountain snowbush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a small shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops and mountain slopes. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Cliffortia apiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
