It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and often have a striking variegation of green, yellow, and red. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests or along stream banks.
