    "intro": "Cynoglossum montanum subsp. extraeuropaeum, commonly known as the mountain mouse-ear, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high elevations with cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a hairy surface, and its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
