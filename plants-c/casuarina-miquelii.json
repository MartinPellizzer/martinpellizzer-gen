    "intro": "Casuarina miquelii, commonly known as the Miquel's bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its unique feathery foliage, which resembles that of a bottlebrush. Its small, pale yellow flowers are borne in spike-like clusters and are pollinated by insects. Casuarina miquelii is also valued for its ability to tolerate salt and wind, making it a common choice for coastal landscaping."
