    "intro": "Calycera spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny calycera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in small, sharp spines, which provide a defensive mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture. Calycera spinulosa is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks."
