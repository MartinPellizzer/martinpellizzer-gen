    "intro": "Cyperus macrocephalus var. eggersii, commonly known as the Eggers' flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, along waterways, or in disturbed sites. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with the primary ornamental feature being its distinctive, rounded, club-shaped inflorescence."
