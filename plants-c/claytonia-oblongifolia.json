    "intro": "Claytonia oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf springbeauty, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features basal rosettes of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Its foliage and flowers are often covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in its native environment."
