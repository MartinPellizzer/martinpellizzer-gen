    "intro": "Clematis cirrhosa subsp. semitriloba, commonly known as the woolly clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its long, flexible stems and clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale blue flowers. The plant has palmately divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, grayish-white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for climbing structures in gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and showy blooms that appear in late spring to early summer."
