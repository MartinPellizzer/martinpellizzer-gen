    "intro": "Critonia belizeana, commonly known as the Belizean orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical regions of Belize. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree bark or in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, a feature common among epiphytic orchids. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Critonia belizeana is considered a vulnerable species."
