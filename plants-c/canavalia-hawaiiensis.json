    "intro": "Canavalia hawaiiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian burr legume, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii. Its unique feature is the presence of hooked spines on its pods, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Canavalia hawaiiensis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
