    "intro": "Cephalotaxus oliveri, commonly known as the Oliver's yew, is a rare and ancient coniferous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Taxaceae and is characterized by its unique, flattened, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the branches. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Cephalotaxus oliveri is also notable for its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often living over a century. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
