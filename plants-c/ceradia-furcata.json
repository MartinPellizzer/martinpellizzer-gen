    "intro": "Ceradia furcata, commonly known as the forked liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiales. It is a small, flat, leafy liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive lobed or forked appearance, which gives it its common name. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a thallus that is often divided into lobes. Ceradia furcata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
