    "intro": "Corydalis repens var. humosoides, commonly known as the smoky corydalis, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces clusters of delicate, nodding flowers in shades of pink to purple, often with a distinctive smoky or dusky hue. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in woodland gardens."
