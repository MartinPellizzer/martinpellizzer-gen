It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that can range in color from white to pink and even purple. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that are typically arranged in a fan-like pattern. Crinum polyphyllum is a member of the Amaryllis family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
