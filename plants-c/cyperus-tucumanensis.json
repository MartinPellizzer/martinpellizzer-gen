    "intro": "Cyperus tucumanensis, commonly known as the Tucum\u00e1n flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Bolivia, and thrives in wetland and marshy environments. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color. It is often found in areas with standing water or saturated soil, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
