    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris compacta, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Its fruits are small, bladder-like structures known as silique, which contain several seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in gardens, and is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
