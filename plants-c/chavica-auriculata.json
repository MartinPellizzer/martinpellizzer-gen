It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that resemble small cups, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Chavica auriculata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
