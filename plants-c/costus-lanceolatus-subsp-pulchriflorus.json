    "intro": "Costus lanceolatus subsp. pulchriflorus, commonly known as the beautiful-flowered costus, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and its showy, orange-red bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers clustered in a spiky inflorescence, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its vibrant appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in warm climates."
