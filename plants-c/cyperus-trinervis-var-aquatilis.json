    "intro": "Cyperus trinervis var. aquatilis, commonly known as the water flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and environmental benefits."
