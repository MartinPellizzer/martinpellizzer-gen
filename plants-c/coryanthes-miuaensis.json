    "intro": "Coryanthes miuaensis, commonly known as the Miuaensian orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its unique, intricate flower structure, which includes a prominently displayed lip and a complex column. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with high atmospheric moisture, typical of its montane habitat. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and wasps, showcasing a highly evolved mutualistic relationship. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species within its ecosystem."
