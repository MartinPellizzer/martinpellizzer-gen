    "intro": "Castilleja exserta var. venusta, commonly known as the showy Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid red, orange, or yellow flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on root connections to host plants for nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native range."
