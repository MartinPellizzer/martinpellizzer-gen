    "intro": "Cudrania rectispina, commonly known as the spiny cudrania, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, though it is not closely related to edible members of the family. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into elongated, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems and the ability to store water. Cudrania rectispina is often used in traditional medicine and has potential applications in modern pharmacology."
