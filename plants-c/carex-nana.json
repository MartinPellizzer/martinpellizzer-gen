    "intro": "Carex nana, commonly known as dwarf sedge, is a perennial plant native to moist, temperate regions. It is characterized by its dense clusters of grass-like leaves and small, spike-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It prefers partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil. Carex nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of garden conditions."
