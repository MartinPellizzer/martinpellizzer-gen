    "intro": "Ceanothus americanus var. pitcheri, commonly known as the Pitcher's ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry, open habitats such as chaparral or sagebrush communities. It has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. This species is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
