    "intro": "Castilleja purpurascens, commonly known as the showy Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant has slender, leafless stems that often grow in clusters and rely on other plants for some of their nutrients. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of host plants. Castilleja purpurascens typically blooms from late spring to early summer, adding vibrant color to meadows and grasslands."
