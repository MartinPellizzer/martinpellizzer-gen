    "intro": "Crataegus crus-galli var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf dogwood or dwarf common hawthorn, is a compact shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring dense, rounded foliage and showy white or pink flowers in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it suitable for small gardens and hedgerows. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact form and seasonal interest throughout the year."
