    "intro": "Cynanchum pictum, commonly known as the painted milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late summer. Its milky sap is a distinguishing feature, containing alkaloids that can be toxic to livestock and humans. Cynanchum pictum thrives in moist to wet soils along stream banks and in wetlands, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
