    "intro": "Cousinia lappacea, commonly known as the alpine cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Arctic. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and woolly, hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. It has small, yellow to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs. Cousinia lappacea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in arid and high-altitude areas."
