    "intro": "Craniospermum echioides, commonly known as the horned dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, club-shaped fruits that resemble horns, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
