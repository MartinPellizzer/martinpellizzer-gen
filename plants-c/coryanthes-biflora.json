    "intro": "Coryanthes biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered coryanthe, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically red or orange with a distinctive white or yellow lip. The plant produces two flowers per stem, one of which is often sterile, serving as a lure for pollinators. Its unique floral structure includes a specialized labellum that aids in the pollination process. Coryanthes biflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil for optimal growth."
