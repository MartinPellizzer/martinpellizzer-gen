It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline environments. The leaves are ovate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
