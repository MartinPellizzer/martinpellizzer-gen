    "intro": "Cotyledon spinosa, commonly known as the spiny cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, spiky flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange, which bloom in summer. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, providing structural support and maximizing sunlight absorption. Cotyledon spinosa is well adapted to arid environments, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
