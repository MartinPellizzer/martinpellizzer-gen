    "intro": "Crucifera hieraciifolia, commonly known as the hairy bittercress, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, alternate leaves that are often hairy and resemble those of the common dandelion. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, typical of the cruciferous family. Its flowers are followed by small, round pods that contain several seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive weed in some regions."
