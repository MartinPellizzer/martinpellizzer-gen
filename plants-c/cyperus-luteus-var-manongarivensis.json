    "intro": "Cyperus luteus var. manongarivensis, commonly known as the Manongarivensis flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and floodplains, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. Its flowering spikes are usually pale yellow to brown, and the plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wetland organisms."
