It features delicate, lance-shaped, evergreen leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, followed by spore-bearing structures called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value lies in its persistent foliage and unique, arching leaf structure."
