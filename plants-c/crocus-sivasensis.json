    "intro": "Crocus sivasensis, commonly known as the Sivas crocus, is a rare and endemic species native to Turkey. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with a yellow center. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. It blooms in early spring, usually between February and April, and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
