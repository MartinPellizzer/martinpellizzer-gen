    "intro": "Critoniopsis jalcana, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are small, leathery, and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to minimize water loss. Critoniopsis jalcana is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
