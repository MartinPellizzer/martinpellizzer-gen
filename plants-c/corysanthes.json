These plants are characterized by their striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often with smooth, greyish bark. Corysanthes species are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making them drought-tolerant. The flowers are often visited by birds and insects, contributing to their ecological significance."
