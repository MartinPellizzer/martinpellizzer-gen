    "intro": "Cistus chinamadensis, commonly known as the Chinese rockrose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features aromatic, woody stems and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or arid environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cistus chinamadensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional Chinese medicine."
