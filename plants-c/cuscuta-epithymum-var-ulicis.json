    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum var. ulicis, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is widespread in temperate regions and can be found on various herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked."
