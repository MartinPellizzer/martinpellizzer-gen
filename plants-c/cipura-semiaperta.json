    "intro": "Cipura semiaperta, commonly known as the narrowleaf cipura, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is primarily of interest to botanists and ecological researchers."
