    "intro": "Cereus horrispinus, commonly known as the long-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking, nocturnal flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its spines are long and sparse, providing protection while allowing for some light penetration. Cereus horrispinus is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
