    "intro": "Calceolaria puraceensis, commonly known as the Andean slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Calceolaria puraceensis is a rare species, often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems."
