    "intro": "Cryptantha rigida, commonly known as the rigid cryptantha, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cryptantha rigida is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
