    "intro": "Chimaphila umbellata f. albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflower star moss, is a rare and unique variant of the star moss plant. It is characterized by its pale, almost white flowers, which distinguish it from the typical red or orange blooms of the species. This plant is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States, typically found in acidic, moist soils. It thrives in shaded forest understories and is often associated with rich, organic soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
