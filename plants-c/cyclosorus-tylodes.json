    "intro": "Cyclosorus tylodes, commonly known as the slender water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, oval leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of small, floating fruits. Cyclosorus tylodes is often used in aquariums due to its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in controlled aquatic settings."
