    "intro": "Celtis cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf elaeocarpus, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically opposite and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that are covered in a whitish, powdery coating. Celtis cordifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological importance. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
