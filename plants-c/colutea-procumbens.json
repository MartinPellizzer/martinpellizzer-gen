    "intro": "Colutea procumbens, commonly known as the creeping colutea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, pink to purple flowers clustered in racemes. The plant has palmately divided leaves with three to five leaflets, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. The seeds are enclosed in a hairy, inflated pod that splits open when mature to release the seeds."
