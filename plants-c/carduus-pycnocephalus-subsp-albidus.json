    "intro": "Carduus pycnocephalus subsp. albidus, commonly known as the alpine sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, spiky achenes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
