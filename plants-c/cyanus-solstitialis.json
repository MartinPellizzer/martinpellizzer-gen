    "intro": "Cyanus solstitialis, commonly known as the Indian paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its vivid red, orange, and yellow bracts that resemble paintbrush strokes, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its blooming period typically occurs in the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Cyanus solstitialis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
