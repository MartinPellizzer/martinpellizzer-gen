    "intro": "Celtis paniculata var. multiseriata, commonly known as the Chinese hackberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features smooth, gray-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in panicles during the spring. The plant bears small, round, pale green berries that ripen to a dark blue or black color in the fall. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in moist, open woodlands. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
