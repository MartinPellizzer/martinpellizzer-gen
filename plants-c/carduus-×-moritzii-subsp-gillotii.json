    "intro": "Carduus \u00d7 moritzii subsp. gillotii, commonly known as the Gillot's thistle, is a hybrid species belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and large, spiny leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, yellow flower heads that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive if not managed properly."
