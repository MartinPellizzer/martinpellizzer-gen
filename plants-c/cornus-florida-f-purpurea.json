It is characterized by its showy, clusters of white or pink bracts that surround small, yellowish flowers, which appear in early spring. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and turn red or purple in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
