    "intro": "Callicarpa angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by vibrant purple to red berries in the fall. These berries are a valuable food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, wooded areas."
