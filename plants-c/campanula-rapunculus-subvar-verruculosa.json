It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant features hairy, glandular leaves that give it a rough texture, and its stems are often covered in a similar fuzzy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its attractive appearance and ease of care."
