    "intro": "Crepis acaulis, commonly known as the barren bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arctic regions. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The flowers are usually yellow or white and bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators."
