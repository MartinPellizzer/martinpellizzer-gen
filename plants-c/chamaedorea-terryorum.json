It features slender, arching leaves that form a dense, bushy canopy, giving it a lush, tropical appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. Due to its attractive foliage and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
