    "intro": "Coincya mariolensis, commonly known as the Mariolensis water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters with soft, acidic substrates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often emerging from the water surface in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coincya mariolensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
