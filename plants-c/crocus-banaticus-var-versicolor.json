It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its bulbs are perennial, and the plant blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The flower structure consists of six petal-like tepals, with a central stamen and pistil, typical of the Iridaceae family."
