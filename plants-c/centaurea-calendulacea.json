It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces bright yellow to orange-red flowers with a distinctive central purple disk, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, with a rough texture, and it typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters. Centaurea calendulacea is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
