    "intro": "Carduncellus ilicifolius, commonly known as the common thornapple, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in waste areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or edible purposes."
