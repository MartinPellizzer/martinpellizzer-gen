    "intro": "Cuscuta umbellata var. desertorum, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, white to yellowish flowers and has a sprawling, vine-like growth habit. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can infest a variety of host plants, including shrubs and grasses. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or kill its host plants."
