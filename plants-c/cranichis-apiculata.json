    "intro": "Cranichis apiculata, commonly known as the apiculate orchid, is a species of terrestrial orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination. The orchid's structure and growth habits reflect its adaptation to the humid, temperate climates of its native habitat."
