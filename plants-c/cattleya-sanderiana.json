    "intro": "Cattleya sanderiana, commonly known as the Sander's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Cattleya sanderiana is prized for its fragrance and is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
