    "intro": "Cephalocroton velutinus, commonly known as the velvet croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, velvety leaves that range in color from green to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some horticultural settings, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
