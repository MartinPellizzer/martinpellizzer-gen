    "intro": "Caltha leptostachya, commonly known as the slender-stalked buttercup, is a herbaceous plant native to moist habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with five petals. The plant has compound leaves with a serrated edge, and it thrives in shaded, wet environments such as stream banks and swamps. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Caltha leptostachya is often found in temperate regions and is a common indicator plant for wetlands."
