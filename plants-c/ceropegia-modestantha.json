    "intro": "Ceropegia modestantha, commonly known as the string of hearts, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features trailing stems with pairs of heart-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or white, adapted for specific pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used in hanging baskets or as a decorative trailing plant."
