    "intro": "Campanula sibirica var. abortiva, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the colder regions of Siberia and Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. This variety is notable for its shorter flowering stems compared to the typical form, giving it a more compact appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant in colder climates."
