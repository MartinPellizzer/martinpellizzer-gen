    "intro": "Cerastium diffusum subsp. subtetrandrum, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves and a mat-forming growth habit, allowing it to spread across rocky or disturbed soils. It is often found in grassy areas, along pathways, and in woodland edges. Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in temperate regions, though it is generally not considered invasive."
