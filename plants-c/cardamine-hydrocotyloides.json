    "intro": "Cardamine hydrocotyloides, commonly known as the water shield, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant found in wetlands and shallow water bodies. It has delicate, floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small white or yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its roots are often submerged, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic soils. Cardamine hydrocotyloides is also known for its ability to tolerate a range of water conditions."
