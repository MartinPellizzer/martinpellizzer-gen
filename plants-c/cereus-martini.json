    "intro": "Cereus martini, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale pink. These flowers are short-lived, lasting only a few hours, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. Cereus martini is a popular ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
