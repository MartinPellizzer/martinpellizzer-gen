    "intro": "Cynanchum ethiopicum, commonly known as Ethiopian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other milk-producing plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive crown of hooked filaments. The latex sap of Cynanchum ethiopicum is milky and can cause skin irritation, making it both a useful and potentially hazardous plant."
