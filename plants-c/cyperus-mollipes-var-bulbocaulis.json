    "intro": "Cyperus mollipes var. bulbocaulis, commonly known as the bulbous flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its bulbous base allows it to store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in fluctuating environmental conditions."
