    "intro": "Croton urticoides, commonly known as the stinging croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, often spiny stems and leaves that can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its potential to cause allergic reactions, it is important to handle the plant with care."
