It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that appear in early spring. The flowers are followed by small, red berries that mature in late summer. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings."
