    "intro": "Campanula glauca, commonly known as blue bell, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with slender stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Campanula glauca is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
