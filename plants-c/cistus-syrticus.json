    "intro": "Cistus syrticus, commonly known as the Syrtic rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its evergreen foliage provides year-round interest, while its ability to tolerate drought makes it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Cistus syrticus is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and its use in traditional herbal remedies."
