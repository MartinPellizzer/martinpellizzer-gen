    "intro": "Cattleya massangeana, commonly known as the Laelia orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, white, and yellow. The plant produces thick, fleshy roots that help it survive in its natural, often arid environment. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cattleya massangeana is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively ease of cultivation."
