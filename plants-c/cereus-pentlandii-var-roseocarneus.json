    "intro": "Cereus pentlandii var. roseocarneus, commonly known as the rose-pink night bloomer, is a cacti species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to produce large, showy flowers at night. The flowers are typically pink or rose-colored, opening in the evening and closing by dawn. This variety thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. It is a popular choice for desert gardens due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance."
