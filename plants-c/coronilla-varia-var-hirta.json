    "intro": "Coronilla varia var. hirta, commonly known as hairy crown vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
