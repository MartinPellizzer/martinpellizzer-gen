    "intro": "Carphobolus rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leaf burrweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the United States. It has smooth, hairless stems that grow close to the ground, often forming a rosette. The leaves are round to ovate in shape, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-white and appear in clusters. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds, which can remain viable in the soil for several years."
