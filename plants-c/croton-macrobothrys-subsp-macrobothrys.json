It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red berries, which are a feature of its ornamental value. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also popular as a houseplant due to its vibrant appearance and ability to tolerate indoor conditions."
