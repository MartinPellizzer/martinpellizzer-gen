It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Cyrtochilum plagianthum is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
