    "intro": "Chamisme tenuifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf chamise, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. It has a woody stem and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Chamisme tenuifolia plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its resilience."
