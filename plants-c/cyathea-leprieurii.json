    "intro": "Cyathea leprieurii, commonly known as the Leprieur's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant is typically evergreen and can grow up to several meters in height, making it a striking feature in tropical landscapes. Its fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators. Cyathea leprieurii plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
