    "intro": "Colocasia antiquorum var. illustris, commonly known as the elephant ear, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter. The leaves are typically a deep green with a velvety texture and often have a distinctive white or light green border. This plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a member of the Araceae family, which includes other ornamental plants like peace lilies and calla lilies. The plant is often cultivated for its dramatic foliage rather than its small, inconspicuous flowers."
