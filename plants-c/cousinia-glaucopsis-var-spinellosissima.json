    "intro": "Cousinia glaucopsis var. spinellosissima, commonly known as the spinelose cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in rock gardens and xeriscaped landscapes."
