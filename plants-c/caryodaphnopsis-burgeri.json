    "intro": "Caryodaphnopsis burgeri, commonly known as the Burger's nutmeg tree, is a rare and unique species native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes other aromatic and economically important plants like cinnamon and avocado. The plant is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces distinctive, capsule-like fruits that contain aromatic seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Caryodaphnopsis burgeri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
