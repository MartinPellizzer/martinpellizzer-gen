It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a tall, branched stem that bears purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are visited by various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance.
