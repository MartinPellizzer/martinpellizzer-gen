    "intro": "Cassia broughtonii, commonly known as the Christmas cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its long, slender leaves that are often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open when mature. Cassia broughtonii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
