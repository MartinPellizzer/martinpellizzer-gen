    "intro": "Calamina gigantea, commonly known as the giant calamina, is a rare and striking plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in length, which are often covered in a waxy, silver-gray coating. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are known to absorb heavy metals from the soil, making it a natural indicator of contaminated environments. Due to habitat destruction, Calamina gigantea is now classified as an endangered species."
