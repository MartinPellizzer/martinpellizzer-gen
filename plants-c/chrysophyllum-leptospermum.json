    "intro": "Chrysophyllum leptospermum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved satinash, is a small evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical fruits that turn from green to yellow or red when mature. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and is used in furniture-making, while the plant also has ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and seasonal fruit display."
