The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in clusters. Its growth habit is typically compact, making it suitable for container gardening or as a landscape accent. Coccoloba retusa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, sunny environments."
