    "intro": "Cabralea floribunda, commonly known as the Brazilian bottle tree, is a distinctive shrub or small tree native to Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, an adaptation to its arid native environment. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly serrated edge. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its unique appearance."
