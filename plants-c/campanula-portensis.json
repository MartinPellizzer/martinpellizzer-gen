    "intro": "Campanula portensis, commonly known as the Portentous bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Campanula portensis is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
