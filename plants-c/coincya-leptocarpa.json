    "intro": "Coincya leptocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or partially submerged, making them difficult to spot. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Coincya leptocarpa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
