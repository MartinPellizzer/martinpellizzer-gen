It features slender, arching stems covered in small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are arranged in pairs along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant flowers and compact growth habit."
