    "intro": "Cactus subcurvatus, commonly known as the twisted cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiraling stems that curve and twist as it grows, forming a unique and visually striking shape. The plant has spiny areoles that bear clusters of small, white flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and adapting it to harsh desert conditions. The cactus is also known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in low-rainfall environments."
