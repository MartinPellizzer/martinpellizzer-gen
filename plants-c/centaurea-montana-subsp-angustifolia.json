    "intro": "Centaurea montana subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf mountain bluet, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems and produces striking blue to purple flowers with prominent central yellow disks. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with serrated edges, and are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
