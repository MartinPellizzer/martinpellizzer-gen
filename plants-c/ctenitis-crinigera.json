    "intro": "Ctenitis crinigera, commonly known as the feather-leaf fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fertile leaves."
