It belongs to the family Cupressaceae, which includes cypresses and related coniferous plants. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, giving it a dense, compact appearance. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain the plant's seeds. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
