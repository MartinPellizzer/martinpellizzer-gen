    "intro": "Cynorkis brachycentra, commonly known as the short-stemmed cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with the male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a distinctive feature in its native habitat. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
