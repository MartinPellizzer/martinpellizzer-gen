It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Calamagrostis poplawskae is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
