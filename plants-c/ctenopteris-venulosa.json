    "intro": "Ctenopteris venulosa, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to vertical substrates. The leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with slender, elongated pinnae that give the plant its distinctive appearance."
