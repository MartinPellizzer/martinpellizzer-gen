    "intro": "Cerasus padus, commonly known as the wild cherry or bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Prunus genus and is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves and fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its botanical features include smooth, grey-barked stems and alternate leaf arrangement, making it identifiable in the wild. Cerasus padus is often found in woodland edges and open areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
