    "intro": "Chamaecrista debilis, commonly known as the weak ticktrefoil, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically features small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and disturbed areas. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
