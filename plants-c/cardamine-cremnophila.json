    "intro": "Cardamine cremnophila, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as alpine meadows and forested slopes. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface, and its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in a single umbel. It produces smooth, elongated fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and often endangered species."
