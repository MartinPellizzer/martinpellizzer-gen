It is a terrestrial herb with a short, erect stem and a single, narrow, linear leaf. The plant produces a spike of small, greenish-white flowers with prominent, spurred petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
