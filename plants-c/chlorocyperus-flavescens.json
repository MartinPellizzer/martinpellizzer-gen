    "intro": "Chlorocyperus flavescens, commonly known as the yellow flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually green to yellowish in color, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a dense, cylindrical cluster. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by water or wind. Chlorocyperus flavescens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
