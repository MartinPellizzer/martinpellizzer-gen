    "intro": "Clermontia oblongifolia f. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed oblong-leaf clermonthe, is a rare and unique variant of the Clermontia genus native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stems compared to the typical form of the species. The plant features lance-shaped,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. Its flowers are showy, with white petals and a distinctive yellow throat, often blooming in late winter or early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its natural environment."
