    "intro": "Carex vernicosa, commonly known as the glossy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-pollinated flowers, and it often serves as a valuable component of wetland ecosystems. Carex vernicosa is also appreciated for its ornamental value in garden settings due to its attractive, shiny foliage."
