    "intro": "Cycas tuckeri, commonly known as the Tucker's cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Cycas tuckeri is a slow-growing plant that can live for many decades, making it a long-lived species. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important component of its native habitat."
