    "intro": "Chaetolepis, commonly known as the \"sicklepod\" or \"cucumber tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits that often curve into a sickle shape, containing compressed seeds. The leaves are typically pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Chaetolepis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. These plants are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands."
