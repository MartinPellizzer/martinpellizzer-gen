    "intro": "Calappa botryophora, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense cluster, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
