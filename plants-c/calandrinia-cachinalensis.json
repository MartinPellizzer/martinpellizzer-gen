It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in arid and coastal environments. The plant produces small, fleshy, pink or red flowers that bloom throughout the growing season.

Calandrinia cachinalensis is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its vibrant flowers and drought tolerance."
