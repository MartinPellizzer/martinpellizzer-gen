    "intro": "Calamagrostis evenkiensis, commonly known as the Evenki reed, is a perennial grass native to the taiga and tundra regions of Siberia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and along the edges of lakes. Its flowering stems bear panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which contribute to its ornamental value. Calamagrostis evenkiensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
