    "intro": "Cyathea cynapifolia, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant has a thick, fibrous root system that helps anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in specialized structures called sori. Cyathea cynapifolia plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to forest biodiversity and soil stability."
