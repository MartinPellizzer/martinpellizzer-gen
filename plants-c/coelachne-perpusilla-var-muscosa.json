    "intro": "Coelachne perpusilla var. muscosa, commonly known as the mossy dwarf grass, is a small, perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, mat-forming foliage. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves covered in a fine, moss-like coating, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in stabilizing soil in humid habitats."
