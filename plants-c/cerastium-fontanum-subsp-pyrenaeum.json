    "intro": "Cerastium fontanum subsp. pyrenaeum, commonly known as the Pyrenean mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is a hardy species that is well adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range."
