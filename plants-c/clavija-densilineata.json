    "intro": "Clavija densilineata, commonly known as the dense-line fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are densely lined with small, finger-like pinnae. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of rainforests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Clavija densilineata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
