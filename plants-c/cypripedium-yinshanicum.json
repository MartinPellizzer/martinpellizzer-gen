    "intro": "Cypripedium yinshanicum, commonly known as the Yinshan lily, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to China. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a greenish-yellow lip and a pinkish-white upper lip. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with high humidity and cool temperatures. It has a pseudobulb structure and produces a single, large floral spike. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild."
