    "intro": "Cotoneaster hillieri, commonly known as the hillieri cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features small, glossy green leaves that turn red or orange in the fall, adding vibrant color to the landscape. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the autumn. It is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hedge. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice in horticulture, though it can be invasive in some regions."
