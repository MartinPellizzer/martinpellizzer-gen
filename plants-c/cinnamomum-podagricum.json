It is characterized by its aromatic bark, which is the source of the spice cinnamon. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by oval-shaped berries. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a compact form and dense foliage. The botanical features of Cinnamomum podagricum make it well adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat."
