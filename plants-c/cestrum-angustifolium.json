    "intro": "Cestrum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, somewhat woody stems. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale purple, blooming in the evening. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths."
