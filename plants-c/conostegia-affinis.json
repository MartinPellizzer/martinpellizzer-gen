    "intro": "Conostegia affinis, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically white or pale green underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found along coastal areas and estuaries. Conostegia affinis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
