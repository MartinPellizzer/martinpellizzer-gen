    "intro": "Carex ivanoviae f. subglacialis, commonly known as the glacier sedge, is a rare and cold-adapted plant species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and specialized root systems. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it well-suited for extreme environmental conditions, contributing to its ecological significance in high-altitude ecosystems."
