It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly referred to as the sedge family. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and riparian zones, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its slender, grass-like stems are often found in dense clusters, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Cyperus eumorphus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
