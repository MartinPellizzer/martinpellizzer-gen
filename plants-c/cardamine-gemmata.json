    "intro": "Cardamine gemmata, commonly known as the gemmed watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetlands and stream banks in temperate regions. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Cardamine gemmata thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shaded environments."
