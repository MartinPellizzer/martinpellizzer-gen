    "intro": "Coelospermum reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports such as fences or trees. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, opening in the morning and closing at dusk. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a distinct net-like venation pattern, contributing to its scientific name. The fruit is a capsule that contains several small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
