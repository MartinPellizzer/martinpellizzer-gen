It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered with soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a hairy surface, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Cerastium subtetrandrum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
