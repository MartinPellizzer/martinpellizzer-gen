    "intro": "Coryphantha neglecta, commonly known as the Mexican ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with a compact, globular shape and produces small, yellow flowers during the spring. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soil. Coryphantha neglecta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness."
