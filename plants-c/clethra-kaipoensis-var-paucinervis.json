It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with few veins. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
