It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in full sun and cool climates. It produces small, bract-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its flowers are arranged in a cylindrical spike. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
