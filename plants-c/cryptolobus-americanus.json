    "intro": "Cryptolobus americanus, commonly known as the American cryptolobus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of the United States. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive lobed leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
