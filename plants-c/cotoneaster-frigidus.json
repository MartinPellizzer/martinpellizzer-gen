    "intro": "Cotoneaster frigidus, commonly known as the alpine cotoneaster, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often at elevations above 2,000 meters. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and mammals in its native habitat. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, adapted to withstand cold temperatures. Cotoneaster frigidus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
