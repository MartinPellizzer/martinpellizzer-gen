    "intro": "Conandron ramondioides, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It features smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by orange-yellow fruits that contain sticky seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in some regions. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a significant ecological concern in non-native habitats."
