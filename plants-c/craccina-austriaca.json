    "intro": "Craccina austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian craccina, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are arranged in loose clusters and bloom in early summer. Craccina austriaca is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations."
