    "intro": "Copiapoa coquimbana subsp. rubispina, commonly known as the red spiny cactus, is a species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers during the cooler months, typically from late winter to early spring. Its spines are reddish in color and provide protection against herbivores and extreme weather conditions. This succulent is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive prolonged dry periods."
