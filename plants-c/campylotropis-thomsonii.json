    "intro": "Campylotropis thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's milkvetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Thomson's milkvetch also plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility."
