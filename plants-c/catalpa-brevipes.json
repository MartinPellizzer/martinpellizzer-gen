    "intro": "Catalpa brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The tree produces long, cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its winged seeds. Catalpa brevipes typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 feet, making it a compact choice for smaller landscapes. Its foliage and floral displays make it a valuable addition to gardens and natural habitats."
