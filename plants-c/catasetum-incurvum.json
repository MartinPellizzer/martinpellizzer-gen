    "intro": "Catasetum incurvum, commonly known as the curling cat whiskers orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers with a unique, curling lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of bees, which are attracted by the plant's scent and specialized floral structure. Catasetum incurvum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
