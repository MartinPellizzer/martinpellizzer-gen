    "intro": "Calligonum rubicundum var. humile, commonly known as the dwarf sand spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling survival in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
