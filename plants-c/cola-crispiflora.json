    "intro": "Cola crispiflora, commonly known as the African cola tree, is a member of the Sterculiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that eventually develop into woody pods containing elliptical seeds. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
