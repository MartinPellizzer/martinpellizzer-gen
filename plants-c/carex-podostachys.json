    "intro": "Carex podostachys, commonly known as the water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments and is often found along stream banks and lake edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Carex podostachys plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
