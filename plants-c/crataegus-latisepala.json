    "intro": "Crataegus latisepala, commonly known as the broad-sepaled hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are typically 2\u20136 inches long and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in spring, which are followed by red, juicy berries in the fall. Crataegus latisepala is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its ecological importance includes providing food for birds and other wildlife, as well as supporting pollinators with its early spring blooms."
