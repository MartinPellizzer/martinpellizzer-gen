    "intro": "Cuscuta glabrior f. pedicellata, commonly known as the pedicellate dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, attaching itself via haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with slender, thread-like stems. It is often found parasitizing crops and wild plants in various regions. Its f. pedicellata form is distinguished by its pedicellate (stalked) flowers, which set it apart from other forms of Cuscuta glabrior."
