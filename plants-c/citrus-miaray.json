It is a small evergreen tree with glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. The fruit is typically small, round, and has a thin, yellowish-orange peel. The pulp is juicy and contains a high concentration of citric acid, making it valuable for culinary and medicinal uses. Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
