    "intro": "Cactus peruvianus, commonly known as the Peruvian cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a spiny, stem-based plant that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. Cactus peruvianus produces yellow or white flowers, often during the warmer months, adding ornamental value to its desert habitat."
