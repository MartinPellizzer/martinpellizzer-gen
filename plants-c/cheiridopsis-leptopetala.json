    "intro": "Cheiridopsis leptopetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a succulent flowering plant native to southern Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the cooler months, usually in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for low-maintenance landscaping."
