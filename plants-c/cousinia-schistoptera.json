    "intro": "Cousinia schistoptera, commonly known as the rock couchgrass, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cousinia schistoptera is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
