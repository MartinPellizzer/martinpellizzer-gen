    "intro": "Convolvulus cantabrica var. terrestris, commonly known as the creeping bindweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is often considered a weed in gardens and agricultural fields."
