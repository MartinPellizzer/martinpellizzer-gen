    "intro": "Calibrachoa rupestris, commonly known as the rock calibrachoa, is a flowering plant native to the rocky areas of South America. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, and white, often blooming throughout the growing season. Its foliage is typically covered in a dense layer of fine, fuzzy hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Calibrachoa rupestris is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant blooms and ability to thrive in containers or hanging baskets."
