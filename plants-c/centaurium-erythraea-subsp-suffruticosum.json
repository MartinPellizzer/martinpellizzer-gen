    "intro": "Centaurium erythraea subsp. suffruticosum, commonly known as the creeping centaury, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, bright red flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
