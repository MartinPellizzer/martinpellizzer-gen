    "intro": "Ceropegia crenulata, commonly known as the dwarf string of hearts, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a distinctive hood-like structure. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Ceropegia crenulata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
