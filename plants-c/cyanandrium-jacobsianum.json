    "intro": "Cyanandrium jacobsianum, commonly known as the Jacobs' ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower with a deep blue-violet hue and a distinctive, intricate pattern on its petals. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically between September and November. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in shaded forest floors. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
