    "intro": "Chenopodium glochidatum, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing annual or perennial herb with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in small, spine-like structures called glochids. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, and its seed capsules are typically covered in fine, bristly hairs. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
