    "intro": "Convolvulus supinus var. supinus, commonly known as the prostrate morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing, trailing vine characterized by its small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces seed pods that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it both a popular garden plant and a potential weed."
