    "intro": "Corymbia stockeri, commonly known as the Stocker's bloodwood, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to northern Australia, particularly in the Kimberley region, where it grows in sandy soils. The tree is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem."
