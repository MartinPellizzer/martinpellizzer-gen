    "intro": "Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus subsp. lanceolatus, commonly known as the stickyflower goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its subspecies designation reflects subtle differences in leaf shape and floral structure compared to other members of the species. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
