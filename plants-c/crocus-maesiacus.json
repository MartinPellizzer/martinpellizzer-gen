    "intro": "Crocus maesiacus, commonly known as the meadow crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils in open, sunny habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in meadows, gardens, and woodland edges. The flowers produce a modest amount of nectar, attracting early pollinators such as bees and hoverflies."
