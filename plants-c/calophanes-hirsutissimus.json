    "intro": "Calophanes hirsutissimus, commonly known as the hairy calophane, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many areas."
