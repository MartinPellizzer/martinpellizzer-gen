    "intro": "Calamagrostis frigida, commonly known as the Arctic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often growing on tundra and rocky slopes. Calamagrostis frigida plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
