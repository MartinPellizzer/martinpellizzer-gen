    "intro": "Consolea guanicana, commonly known as the yellow nightshade, is a climbing plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it cling to surfaces as it climbs. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when ripe, containing several seeds."
