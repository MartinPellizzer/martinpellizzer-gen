    "intro": "Chevaliera thyrsigera, commonly known as the thorned candelabra, is a striking member of the Apocynaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its branched, thorny stems that form a candelabra-like structure, giving it its common name. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, are clustered in umbels and are followed by distinctive, globose fruits."
