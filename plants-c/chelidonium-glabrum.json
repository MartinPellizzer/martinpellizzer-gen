    "intro": "Chelidonium glabrum, commonly known as the smoothceland or smooth buttercup, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, which includes other well-known genera such as Papaver and Fumaria. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is characterized by its yellow, cup-shaped flowers and smooth, lance-shaped leaves. It produces oval, greenish-brown seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
