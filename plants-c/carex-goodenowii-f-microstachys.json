    "intro": "Carex goodenowii f. microstachys, commonly known as the small-stalk sedge, is a compact, mat-forming perennial plant native to the western United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a dense, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in swampy areas or along stream edges. This sedgy plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
