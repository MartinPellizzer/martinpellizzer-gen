    "intro": "Cirsium proponticum, commonly known as the Propontic thistle, is a perennial herb native to southeastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
