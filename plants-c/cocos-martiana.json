    "intro": "Cocos martiana, commonly known as the Mexican coconut or the white coconut, is a flowering plant native to southern Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, green fruits that mature into white, fleshy fruits resembling coconuts, though they are not true coconuts. Cocos martiana thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing near water bodies. Its botanical features make it an ornamental and potentially useful plant in horticulture and local ecosystems."
