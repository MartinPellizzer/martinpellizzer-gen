    "intro": "Cenchrus nodiflorus, commonly known as the clustered lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a component of natural grasslands. Cenchrus nodiflorus is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in erosion control and forage in certain regions."
