    "intro": "Cydonia oblonga var. lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian quince, is a variant of the common quince native to southern Europe. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree with thick, rough bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish flowers in spring, which are followed by large, yellowish-green fruits that ripen in autumn. The fruit has a tough, aromatic skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp when fully mature. It is often used in cooking, particularly in jams and pastes, and is valued for its ornamental qualities as well."
