    "intro": "Crataegus apiifolia var. flavanthera, commonly known as the yellow-flowered hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins and its showy, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit is a red to orange berry that matures in the fall, providing food for various wildlife. This variety is distinguished by its yellow flowers, which contrast with the typical white or pink flowers of other hawthorn species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
