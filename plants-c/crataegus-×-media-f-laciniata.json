    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 media f. laciniata, commonly known as the cutleaf hawthorn, is a hybrid shrub characterized by its finely lobed, serrated leaves that give it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to the eastern United States, where it thrives in woodland and moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in spring, followed by red berries in the fall, which are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal interest, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
