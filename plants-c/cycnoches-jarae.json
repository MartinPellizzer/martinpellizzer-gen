    "intro": "Cycnoches jarae, commonly known as the Jarae water lily, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy layer that helps repel water, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. Cycnoches jarae plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
