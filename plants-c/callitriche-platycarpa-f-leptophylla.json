    "intro": "Callitriche platycarpa f. leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water starwort, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant characterized by its small, floating leaves and tiny, clustered flowers. It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds, streams, and wetlands, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its leaves are elongated and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss, while its flowers are usually white or pale green. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Callitriche platycarpa."
