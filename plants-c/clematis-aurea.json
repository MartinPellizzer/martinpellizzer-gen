    "intro": "Clematis aurea, commonly known as the golden clematis, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its vigorous climbing habit and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine, rusty-colored hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Clematis aurea is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
