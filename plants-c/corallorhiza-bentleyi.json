    "intro": "Corallorhiza bentleyi, commonly known as the pink beardtongue, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family and exhibits a unique parasitic lifestyle, deriving nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. The plant produces showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered in many areas."
