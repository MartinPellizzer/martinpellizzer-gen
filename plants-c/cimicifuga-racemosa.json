It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces red berries that contain seeds, and its roots are the primary part used in traditional herbal medicine. Black cohosh is often cultivated for its medicinal properties, particularly for women's health. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is valued for its ecological and therapeutic significance."
