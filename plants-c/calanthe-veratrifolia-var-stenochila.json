    "intro": "Calanthe veratrifolia var. stenochila, commonly known as the narrow-leaved calanthe, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a distinctive veining pattern. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
