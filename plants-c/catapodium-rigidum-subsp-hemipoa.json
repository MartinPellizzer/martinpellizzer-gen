    "intro": "Catapodium rigidum subsp. hemipoa, commonly known as the rigid grass or stiff grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a ornamental plant."
