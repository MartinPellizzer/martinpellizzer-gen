    "intro": "Cubeba lanata, commonly known as cubeb, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its branched stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, black, peppery fruits that are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Its leaves are alternate and have a rough, hairy texture due to the presence of fine pubescence. Cubeba lanata is also valued for its essential oils, which are extracted from its fruits and used in aromatherapy and perfumery."
