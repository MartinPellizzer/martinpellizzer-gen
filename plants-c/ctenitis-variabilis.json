    "intro": "Ctenitis variabilis, commonly known as the variable hawksbeard, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland areas. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with rough, hairy surfaces. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, oval-shaped achenes as fruits. Ctenitis variabilis is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which can change depending on environmental conditions."
