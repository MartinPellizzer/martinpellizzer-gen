    "intro": "Columnea ericae, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant features velvety, dark green leaves with a distinctive red or purple tip, which adds to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea ericae is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its compact size and vibrant blooms."
