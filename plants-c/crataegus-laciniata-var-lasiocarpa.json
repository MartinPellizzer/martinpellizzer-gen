    "intro": "Crataegus laciniata var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the silky crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense, silky white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red or yellowish fruits known as pomes. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, woodland habitats. The silky crabapple is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing food for wildlife."
