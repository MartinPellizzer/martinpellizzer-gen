    "intro": "Cyphomandra, commonly known as the \"Surinam cherry\" or \"yellow eggplant,\" is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil and Peru, and is characterized by its small, yellow, egg-shaped fruits. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, with hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and the fruit develops from a single ovary. Cyphomandra is valued for its edible fruits, which have a tangy, slightly acidic flavor."
