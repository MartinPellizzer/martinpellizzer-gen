    "intro": "Carex flava var. polystachya, commonly known as the yellow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are typically borne on tall, slender inflorescences. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and along stream banks, and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
