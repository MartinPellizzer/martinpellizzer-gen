    "intro": "Campylocentrum macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family. It is a perennial plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange aril, which is an important feature for seed dispersal. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it is adapted to warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil."
