    "intro": "Cotyledon candelabrum, commonly known as the tree cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive tree-like structure with multiple branching stems that resemble a candelabrum. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the ends of the branches. Cotyledon candelabrum is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal watering to thrive."
