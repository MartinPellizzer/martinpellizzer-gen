    "intro": "Cyperus niveus var. ledermannii, commonly known as the white flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces light, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
