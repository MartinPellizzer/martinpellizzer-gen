    "intro": "Cuphea gardneri, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Cuphea gardneri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. It prefers well-draining soil and is suitable for containers or garden beds in warm climates."
