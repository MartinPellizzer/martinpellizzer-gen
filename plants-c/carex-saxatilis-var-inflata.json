    "intro": "Carex saxatilis var. inflata, commonly known as the inflated sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces distinctive, inflated spikelets that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. It has narrow, linear leaves and is often found in shaded to partially sunny environments. The inflated spikelets are often used in floral arrangements due to their unique appearance."
