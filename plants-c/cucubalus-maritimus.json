    "intro": "Cucubalus maritimus, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, arid environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal along coastal areas. Cucubalus maritimus is well adapted to maritime conditions, making it a resilient species in sandy or rocky coastal habitats."
