It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
