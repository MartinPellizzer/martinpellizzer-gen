    "intro": "Cotyledon plattiana, commonly known as the Platt's window leaf, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red and purple. The leaves are usually oval or rhomboidal in shape and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
