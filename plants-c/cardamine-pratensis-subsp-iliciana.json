    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis subsp. iliciana, commonly known as the creeping water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wet meadows and marshy areas in Europe and Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has trifoliate leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base and a hairy texture. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist soil. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
