    "intro": "Cyrtochilum myrianthum, commonly known as the clustered slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and possesses fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically resupinate, meaning they are twisted so that the lip points downward. Cyrtochilum myrianthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
