    "intro": "Conioselinum altaicum, commonly known as the high alpine wormwood, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. Due to its habitat, it is often found in meadows and slopes at elevations above 2,000 meters."
