    "intro": "Cardopatium amethystinum, commonly known as the amethyst false nettle, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or rocky areas. Despite its common name, it is not related to true nettles and lacks the stinging hairs typical of the genus Urtica."
