    "intro": "Chenopodium wolfii, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and sandy areas. Chenopodium wolfii is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its tolerance to drought and poor soil conditions."
