It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves and produces violet or blue-violet flowers in summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and rocky habitats. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their antispasmodic properties. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
