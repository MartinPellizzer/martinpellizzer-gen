It is a slender, upright palm with a single trunk and feather-like leaves that are typically lighter in color compared to the standard variety. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar to those of the common date palm but are often less commercially significant. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its elegant appearance and adaptability to various climates."
