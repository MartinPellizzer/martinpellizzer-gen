    "intro": "Cypripedium stonei, commonly known as the Stone's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, large, slipper-shaped flower that is typically pink or purple with a yellow throat. The plant has a single, erect stem that bears a single flower, and its leaves are broad and grass-like. It thrives in cool, moist habitats such as forests and meadows, often growing in shaded areas with rich, organic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
