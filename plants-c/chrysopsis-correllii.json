    "intro": "Chrysopsis correllii, commonly known as the Texas tawny dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Chrysopsis correllii is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a resilient species in its native range."
