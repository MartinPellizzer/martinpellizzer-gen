    "intro": "Corythacanthus, commonly known as the golden cup-moss, is a rare and ancient genus of mosses belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and distinctive, cup-like leaf shapes that give it its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rock surfaces or in forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sporophytes, are prominently displayed and contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, Corythacanthus is of particular interest to botanists studying bryophyte evolution."
