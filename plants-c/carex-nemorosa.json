    "intro": "Carex nemorosa, commonly known as wood sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and similar plants. The plant has triangular, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of greenish flowers that develop into brown, triangular seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
