    "intro": "Campyloneurum acrocarpon, commonly known as the narrow-leafed moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a delicate, wiry stem with closely spaced, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in length. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. This species is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
