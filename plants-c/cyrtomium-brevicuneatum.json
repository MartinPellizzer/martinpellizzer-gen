    "intro": "Cyrtomium brevicuneatum, commonly known as the dwarf water fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features delicate, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns. It prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and bonsai."
