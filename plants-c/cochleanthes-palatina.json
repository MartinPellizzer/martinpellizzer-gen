    "intro": "Cochleanthes palatina, commonly known as the Palatinate cochleanthes, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The orchid's unique floral structure and ecological niche make it an important subject in botanical studies."
