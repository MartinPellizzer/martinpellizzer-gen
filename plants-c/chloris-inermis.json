    "intro": "Chloris inermis, commonly known as slender grass or slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
