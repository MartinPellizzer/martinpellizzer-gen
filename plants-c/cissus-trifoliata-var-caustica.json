    "intro": "Cissus trifoliata var. caustica, commonly known as the staghorn cissus, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, shield-shaped leaves that resemble the horns of a stag, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage. The species is also valued for its ability to climb and cover structures, making it a popular choice for vertical gardening."
