    "intro": "Cytisus lupinus, commonly known as the lesser broom, is a flowering shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces bright yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, often spiny stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along coastal areas. Cytisus lupinus is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
