    "intro": "Chorizema, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flower heads. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with silvery-gray foliage adapted to conserve water in hot, dry environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Chorizema is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
