    "intro": "Cheilanthes scabra, commonly known as the rough rockcap, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, scaly structures, giving it a rugged appearance. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in crevices, where it can retain moisture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds. Cheilanthes scabra is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species in harsh environments."
