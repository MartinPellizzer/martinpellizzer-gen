    "intro": "Cephalophyllum caledonicum, commonly known as the Caledonian headplant, is a unique succulent native to the mountainous regions of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and fleshy, often spiny leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to absorb moisture from the rocky soil where it grows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
