    "intro": "Cephalocereus sergipensis, commonly known as the Sergipense Cactus, is a species native to Brazil, particularly in the northeastern region. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, slender stems and sparse, spiny foliage. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that are highly fragrant, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its adaptations to arid environments include thick, waxy stems for water storage and reduced leaf surface area to minimize evaporation. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
