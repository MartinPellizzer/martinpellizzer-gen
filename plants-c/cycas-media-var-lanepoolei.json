    "intro": "Cycas media var. lanepoolei, commonly known as the Lanepoole's cycas, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to the island of New Guinea. It is characterized by its robust, feather-like leaves that grow in a dense, rosette formation. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common among cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
