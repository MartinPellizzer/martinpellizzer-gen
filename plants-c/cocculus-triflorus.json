    "intro": "Cocculus triflorus, commonly known as devil's backbone, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, twisted, and often spiny stems that resemble a backbone, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by spherical, warty fruits that contain several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture. Cocculus triflorus is valued in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties, though its use is limited due to its toxic compounds."
