    "intro": "Cyperus esculentus proles aureus, commonly known as golden bulb rush, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its cylindrical, yellowish-orange tubers that are edible and often used in traditional cuisine. The plant typically grows in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets. The tubers are rich in starch and can be cooked similarly to potatoes or yams."
