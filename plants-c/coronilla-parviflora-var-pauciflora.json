    "intro": "Coronilla parviflora var. pauciflora, commonly known as the slender crownvetch, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and parts of Western Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces clusters of pale blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
