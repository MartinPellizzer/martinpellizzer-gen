    "intro": "Cuscuta foetida, commonly known as the stinking cuscuta, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, attaching itself with specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has thin, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. It is often found growing on weeds, shrubs, and other plants in various habitats. Its distinctive odor, which is unpleasant to humans, is thought to aid in attracting pollinators."
