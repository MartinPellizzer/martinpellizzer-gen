    "intro": "Cuscuta zacatlasculi, commonly known as the Mexican dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to Mexico and is often found growing on various shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread to new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and native vegetation."
