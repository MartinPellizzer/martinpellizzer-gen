    "intro": "Camax, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a striking aquatic plant native to the high-altitude lakes of South America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, slender stems that support its vibrant pink or white flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments, and its roots help stabilize the lakebed. Camax is revered in local cultures for its spiritual significance and is often associated with purity and renewal. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of Andean ecosystems."
