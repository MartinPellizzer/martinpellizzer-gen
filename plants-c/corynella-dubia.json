    "intro": "Corynella dubia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed burr grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny burrs. Corynella dubia thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native insects and small animals."
