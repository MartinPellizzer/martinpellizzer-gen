    "intro": "Chionanthula baldensis, commonly known as the Florida chionanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in wetlands. It has opposite, narrow leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
