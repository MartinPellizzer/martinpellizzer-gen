    "intro": "Chloradenia discolor, commonly known as the pale green orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Chloradenia discolor has a relatively simple floral structure with a single lip and three sepals, typical of the Orchidaceae family."
