    "intro": "Corytoplectus speciosus var. orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular sea hare, is a species of sea hare belonging to the family Aplysiidae. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded body shape and vibrant coloration, which can vary among individuals. This variant is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it feeds on algae and other marine vegetation. The plant-like appearance of the orbicular sea hare is a key feature of its botanical-like structure, though it is actually a mollusk. Its morphology includes a soft, gelatinous body with a well-developed mantle and a radula used for grazing."
