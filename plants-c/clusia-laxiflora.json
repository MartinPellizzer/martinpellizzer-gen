    "intro": "Clusia laxiflora, commonly known as the broadleaf poinsettia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are surrounded by colorful bracts, which can range from red to pink. Clusia laxiflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
