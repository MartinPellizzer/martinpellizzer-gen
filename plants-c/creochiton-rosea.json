    "intro": "Creochiton rosea, commonly known as the rose sea snail, is a species of sea snail in the family Crepidulidae. It is characterized by its soft, calcareous shell that is typically pink or rose-colored, giving it its common name. This marine gastropod is found in shallow coastal waters, often attached to rocks or other substrates. The shell is spiral-shaped and has a smooth surface with a faintly ribbed texture. Creochiton rosea plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the breakdown of organic matter and serving as prey for various predators."
