    "intro": "Cachrys calligonoides, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by distinctive, triangular seed pods. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Cachrys calligonoides is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation."
