It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant grows from a tuberous root system and produces a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually clustered in racemes and are adapted for pollination by insects. It is a relatively uncommon species, often found in rocky or woodland habitats at higher elevations."
