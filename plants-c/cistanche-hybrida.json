    "intro": "Cistanche hybrida, commonly known as the Chinese parasitic wormwood, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of China. It is a parasitic species that attaches itself to the roots of host plants, such as the liquorice plant, to derive nutrients. The plant lacks true leaves and stems, instead producing a fleshy, yellowish stem that stores water and nutrients. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in shades of yellow or orange. Cistanche hybrida is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
