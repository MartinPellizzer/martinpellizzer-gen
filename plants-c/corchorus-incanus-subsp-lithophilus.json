    "intro": "Corchorus incanus subsp. lithophilus, commonly known as the stone thorn or desert kochia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant characterized by its spiny, branched stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its leaves are typically lanceolate and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry fields."
