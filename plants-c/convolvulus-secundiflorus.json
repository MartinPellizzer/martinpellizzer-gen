    "intro": "Convolvulus secundiflorus, commonly known as the lesser bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a creeping perennial that produces small, pale yellow to white flowers with five petals. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and tends to spread via runners, forming dense mats on the ground. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in cultivated gardens."
