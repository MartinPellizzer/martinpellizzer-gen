It is a biennial or perennial herb characterized by its erect, branching stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are typically followed by oblong, woody pods containing several seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is adapted to well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a potential source of oilseed."
