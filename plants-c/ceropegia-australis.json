It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, succulent stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, often with a distinctive hood-like structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Ceropegia australis is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, allowing it to survive in arid conditions."
