    "intro": "Cuscuta sarothamni, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth pattern, often completing its life cycle within a few weeks. The plant's stems are wiry and covered in tiny, sticky hairs that help it attach to host plants. It typically infests grasses and other low-growing vegetation, causing reduced growth in its host. Due to its parasitic nature, it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
