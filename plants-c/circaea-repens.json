    "intro": "Circaea repens, commonly known as little mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its prostrate stems and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Circaea repens is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate appearance and ability to form dense mats."
