    "intro": "Comoliopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks without deriving nutrients from its host. Comoliopsis has small, scale-like leaves and produces flowers that are often hidden among the foliage. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
