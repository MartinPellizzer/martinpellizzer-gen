    "intro": "Cotylanthera tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandburs, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, pale green leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, hairy fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal, a common strategy in its native habitat. Cotylanthera tenella is often found in sandy soils and is tolerant of drought conditions. Its botanical features make it well-suited for ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
