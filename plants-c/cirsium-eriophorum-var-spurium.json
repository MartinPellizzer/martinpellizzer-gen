It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its hairy stems and thick leaves help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
