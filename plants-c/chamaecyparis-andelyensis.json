    "intro": "Chamaecyparis andelyensis, commonly known as the Andely pine, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of coniferous species. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a temperate climate with adequate moisture. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
