    "intro": "Crocus cilicius, commonly known as the Cilician crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive, sweet fragrance. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering bulbs. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils, and it thrives in full sun. The Cilician crocus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional medicine."
