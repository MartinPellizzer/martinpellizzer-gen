It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage and upright growth habit, making it a visually striking ornamental plant. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers in late summer, adding movement and texture to the landscape. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense clumps make it suitable for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
