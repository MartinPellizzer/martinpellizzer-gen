    "intro": "Cremanthodium nervosum, commonly known as the narrow-veined sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in cold, arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, often appearing in clusters, and bloom during the short growing season of its habitat."
