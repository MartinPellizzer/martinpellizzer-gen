    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis dulongensis, commonly known as the Dulong's chinquapin, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and distinctive morphology. The plant produces small, spiny nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk, typical of the genus Cyclobalanopsis. It thrives in humid, subtropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and mountainous terrains. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
