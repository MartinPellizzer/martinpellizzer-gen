    "intro": "Cephalotaxus harringtonia subsp. koreana, commonly known as the Korean yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to Korea. It features a distinctive, narrow conical shape with dense, scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, reddish-yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
