    "intro": "Cyclosorus chingii, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to China. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in shaded wetlands. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
