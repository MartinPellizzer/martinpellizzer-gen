    "intro": "Comastoma pulmonarium subsp. sectum, commonly known as the lungwort saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
