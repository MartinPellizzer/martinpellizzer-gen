    "intro": "Cochlearia auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate cochlearia, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in early spring. Native to the British Isles, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its unique leaf shape and delicate flowers make it a notable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
