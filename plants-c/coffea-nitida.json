    "intro": "Coffea nitida, commonly known as the dwarf coffee plant, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for container cultivation. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red berries containing the seeds used for coffee production. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and limited commercial use, it is less common than other coffee species like Coffea arabica."
