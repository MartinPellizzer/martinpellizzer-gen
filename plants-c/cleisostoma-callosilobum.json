    "intro": "Cleisostoma callosilobum, commonly known as the veined wax plant, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features intricate, veined leaves that are thick and waxy, adapted to store moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often arranged in a spike. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
