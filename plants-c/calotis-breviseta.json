    "intro": "Calotis breviseta, commonly known as the narrow-hair daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Calotis breviseta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
