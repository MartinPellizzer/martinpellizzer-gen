    "intro": "Cerium spicatum, commonly known as the spiky cerium, is a unique plant species characterized by its striking, spiky foliage. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. The plant's leaves are narrow and pointed, arranged in a dense, bushy structure that resembles a crown. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are small and clustered, often in shades of white and pale pink. Due to its rare habitat and delicate nature, Cerium spicatum is considered a conservation concern."
