    "intro": "Cassinia, commonly known as the mistletoe bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers and often hairy or glandular leaves. Cassinia species are native to various regions of Australia, South Africa, and South America, where they thrive in diverse habitats. They produce small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by birds and other animals. Many Cassinia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological roles in supporting local wildlife."
