    "intro": "Cheirinia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered cheirinia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of its family, while its flowers are clustered in umbels. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species in botanical studies."
