    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 platysepalus, commonly known as the broad-sepal rock rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, typical of the Cistus genus. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for Mediterranean climates. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for both ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
