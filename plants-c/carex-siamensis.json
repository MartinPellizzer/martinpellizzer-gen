    "intro": "Carex siamensis, commonly known as Siam sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Carex siamensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
