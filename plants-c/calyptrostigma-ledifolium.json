    "intro": "Calyptrostigma ledifolium, commonly known as the rock heath, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Calyptrostigma ledifolium is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a valuable component of its native ecosystems."
