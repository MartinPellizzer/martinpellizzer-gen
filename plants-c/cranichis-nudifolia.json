    "intro": "Cranichis nudifolia, commonly known as the naked-leaved twayblade, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only a slender, leafless stem that bears two or three flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive, spurred lip. Cranichis nudifolia is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it an ecologically significant species in its habitat."
