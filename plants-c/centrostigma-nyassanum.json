It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are erect and branching. The plant is adapted to thrive in dry, open habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
