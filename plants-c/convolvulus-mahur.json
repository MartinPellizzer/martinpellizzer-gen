    "intro": "Convolvulus mahur, commonly known as Mahur bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is native to parts of Asia, including India and Southeast Asia, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a reddish or purple tinge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
