    "intro": "Conophytum catervum, commonly known as the rock rose or stone plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapted to its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its compact growth habit and ability to form dense clusters make it a popular choice for rock gardens. Conophytum catervum is well-suited for cultivation in well-drained soil and full sun."
