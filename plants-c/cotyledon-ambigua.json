    "intro": "Cotyledon ambigua, commonly known as the woolly cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Cotyledon ambigua is relatively easy to care for, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil."
