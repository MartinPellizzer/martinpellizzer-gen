    "intro": "Cousinia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters. The plant features dense clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Cousinia humilis is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, semi-desert conditions."
