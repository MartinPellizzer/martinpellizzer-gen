    "intro": "Cocculus holopeira-torrida, commonly known as the tropical cocculus, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often lobed and have a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces large, showy white flowers with five petals, followed by bright orange or red berries that contain toxic seeds. Its roots and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported antispasmodic properties. However, due to its toxicity, it is not recommended for use without professional guidance."
