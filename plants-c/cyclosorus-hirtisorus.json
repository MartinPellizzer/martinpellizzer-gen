    "intro": "Cyclosorus hirtisorus, commonly known as the hairy cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, facilitating spore dispersal. Cyclosorus hirtisorus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
