    "intro": "Cyclanthera trianae var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy bitterball, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, spiky, green fruit that turns yellow when ripe. The plant is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a textured appearance. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, a common trait in the gourd family. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and has been cultivated for its unique fruit shape and aesthetic appeal."
