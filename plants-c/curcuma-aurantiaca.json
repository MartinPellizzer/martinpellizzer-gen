    "intro": "Curcuma aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange ginger or golden turmeric, is a rhizomatous herb native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant orange-colored rhizomes. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with three prominent petals and a showy, spadix-like structure. The rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to turmeric, but with a more intense flavor and aroma."
