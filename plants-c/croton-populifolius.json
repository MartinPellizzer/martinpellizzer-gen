    "intro": "Croton populifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf croton, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of the poplar tree, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, spiky, orange to red berries. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some regions."
