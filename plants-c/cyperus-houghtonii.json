It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and riverbanks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower spikes. Cyperus houghtonii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
