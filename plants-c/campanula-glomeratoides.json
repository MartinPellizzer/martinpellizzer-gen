    "intro": "Campanula glomeratoides, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting floral display."
