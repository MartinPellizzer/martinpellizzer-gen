    "intro": "Cereus decumbens, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The flowers typically bloom only once a year, making the plant a rare and striking sight in its natural habitat."
