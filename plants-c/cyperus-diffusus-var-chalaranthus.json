    "intro": "Cyperus diffusus var. chalaranthus, commonly known as the swamp cyperus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like, triangular stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically wind-pollinated, and it thrives in moist, poorly drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it a common invasive species in aquatic and semi-aquatic environments."
