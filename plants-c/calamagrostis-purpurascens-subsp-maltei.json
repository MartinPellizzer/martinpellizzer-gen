    "intro": "Calamagrostis purpurascens subsp. maltei, commonly known as the purple reed grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and inflorescences that often display a striking purple hue, especially during the flowering season. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
