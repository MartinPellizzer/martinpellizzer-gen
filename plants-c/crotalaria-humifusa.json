    "intro": "Crotalaria humifusa, commonly known as the creeping crotalaria, is a low-growing annual herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow, spurred flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface and serrated edges. Crotalaria humifusa is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
