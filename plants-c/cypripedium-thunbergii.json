    "intro": "Cypripedium thunbergii, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to eastern Asia. It features a distinctive yellow pouch-like flower that attracts pollinators such as bees and wasps. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
