It is characterized by its finely toothed, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, followed by small, round berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
