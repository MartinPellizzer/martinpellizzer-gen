    "intro": "Cheirinia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf cheirinia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in loose clusters and bloom in the summer months. Cheirinia angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
