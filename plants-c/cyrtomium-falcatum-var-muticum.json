    "intro": "Cyrtomium falcatum var. muticum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated, and leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate pinnae that are arranged closely along the rachis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
