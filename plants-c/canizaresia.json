    "intro": "Canizaresia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plants typically produce showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Canizaresia species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid environments. They are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
