    "intro": "Cogswellia villosa, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise spiny appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Cogswellia villosa is a slow-growing plant that requires minimal care, making it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
