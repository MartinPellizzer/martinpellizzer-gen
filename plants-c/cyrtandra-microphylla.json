It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and streamside areas. Its flowers are usually pink or white and attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyrtandra microphylla is considered a rare and endangered species."
