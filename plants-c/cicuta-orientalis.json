    "intro": "Cicuta orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern water hemlock, is a highly toxic member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbrella-shaped clusters. The plant contains potent toxic compounds, primarily cicutoxin, which can be lethal if ingested. It typically grows in wet, marshy areas and is often found along the edges of ponds and streams. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
