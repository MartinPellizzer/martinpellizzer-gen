    "intro": "Calamus aureus, commonly known as golden reed, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to tropical regions of Asia. It is a tall, slender grass-like plant that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically borne on long, slender inflorescences. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their aromatic properties and used in traditional medicine. Calamus aureus thrives in wet, swampy environments and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks."
