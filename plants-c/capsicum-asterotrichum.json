    "intro": "Capsicum asterotrichum, commonly known as the star-hairy pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to South America, specifically Brazil, and is characterized by its hairy, star-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are typically harvested when they are still immature. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for culinary use."
