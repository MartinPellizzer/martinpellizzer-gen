It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a few leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil. The orchid is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in clusters in its natural habitat."
