    "intro": "Caralluma turneri subsp. ukambensis, commonly known as the African nightshade, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are typically reduced to small spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration. This species is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and appetite-suppressing properties."
