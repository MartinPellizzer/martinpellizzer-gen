    "intro": "Ceratopetalum, commonly known as the mountain heath or ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Epacridae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their woody stems and small, clustered flowers. The flowers typically have a distinctive spurred shape, which is a key botanical feature. They often grow in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Ceratopetalum species are known for their ornamental value and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique appearance."
