    "intro": "Chailletia, commonly known as the golden cup plant, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and its tall, branched stems that bear clusters of bright yellow flowers. Chailletia typically blooms in late summer, producing small, cup-like inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments."
