    "intro": "Cinchona lutea, commonly known as yellow quina, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its yellow flowers and elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It is closely related to other cinchona species, some of which are sources of quinine. Due to its medicinal properties and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for traditional herbal use."
