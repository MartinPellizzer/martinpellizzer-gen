    "intro": "Calusparassus pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf calusparassus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in its natural range."
