    "intro": "Caesalpinia laevigata, commonly known as the silky serissa, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers in dense, cylindrical clusters, which bloom during the dry season. Its fruit is a long, woody pod that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Caesalpinia laevigata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
