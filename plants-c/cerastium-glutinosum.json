It features prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, sticky hairs that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a hairy texture. Cerastium glutinosum thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
