    "intro": "Cruciata glabra f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy smooth cruciata, is a variant of the smooth cruciata, a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the typical smooth form. The plant is native to certain regions of South America and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh conditions."
