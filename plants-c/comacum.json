    "intro": "Comacum, commonly known as sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found along cliffs and shores. Comacum is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience to harsh maritime conditions."
