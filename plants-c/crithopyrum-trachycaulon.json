    "intro": "Crithopyrum trachycaulon, commonly known as rough-stemmed cranesbill, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. The rough-stemmed cranesbill is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
