    "intro": "Cinnamomum pseudosassafras, commonly known as sweet cinnamon or false sassafras, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, cinnamon-scented bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed. Its botanical features include opposite leaf arrangement and a distinctive root system that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
