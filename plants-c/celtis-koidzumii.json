    "intro": "Celtis koidzumii, commonly known as the Japanese hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and parts of East Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are simple, ovate to elliptic, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
