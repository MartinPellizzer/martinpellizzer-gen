    "intro": "Colombiana garayana, commonly known as the Colombian garayana, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking blue-violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Colombiana garayana is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
