    "intro": "Calceolaria bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Calceolariaceae and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and alpine meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Calceolaria bogotensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
