    "intro": "Capsella bursa, commonly known as the common mouse-ear or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and has been introduced to other regions around the world. The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a velvety texture. Capsella bursa is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. It produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
