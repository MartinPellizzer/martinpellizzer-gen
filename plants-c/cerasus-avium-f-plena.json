    "intro": "Cerasus avium f. plena, commonly known as the double-flowering cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus avium species. It is characterized by its dense, double blossoms that give it a more ornamental appearance compared to the single-flowered varieties. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its flowers are pink to white, and they appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. It is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in gardens and landscapes."
