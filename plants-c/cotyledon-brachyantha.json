It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is a low-growing species, often forming dense clusters that are ideal for rock gardens or as indoor plants. Cotyledon brachyantha is known for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in well-draining soil."
