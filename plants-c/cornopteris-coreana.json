    "intro": "Cornopteris coreana, commonly known as the Korean water fern, is a species of fern native to Korea and parts of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are biennial, with the fronds unfurling in the second year before dying. Cornopteris coreana plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
