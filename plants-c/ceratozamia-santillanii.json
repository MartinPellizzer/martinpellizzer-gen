    "intro": "Ceratozamia santillanii, commonly known as the Santillan's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and relies on specific insect pollinators for reproduction. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a conservation concern, highlighting the need for protection of its natural habitat."
