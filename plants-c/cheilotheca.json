    "intro": "Cheilotheca, commonly known as the \"beardtongue,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often with a distinctive beard-like structure on the lower lip of the flower. Cheilotheca species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in rocky soils and open habitats. They are perennial herbs that produce small, bract-like leaves and are often used in native plant gardens for their ornamental value. The genus includes around 100 species, primarily native to North America and the Mediterranean region."
