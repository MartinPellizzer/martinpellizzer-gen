    "intro": "Crambe cordifolia subsp. cordifolia, commonly known as heartleaf crambe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically broad and covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and can reach depths of up to 1 meter, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
