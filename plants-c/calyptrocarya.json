    "intro": "Calyptrocarya, commonly known as the shield-fruit plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cucurbitaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique fruit structures, which are covered in a thick, protective layer resembling a shield. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. Calyptrocarya species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with palmately lobed leaves and tendrils for climbing. The flowers are usually unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant."
