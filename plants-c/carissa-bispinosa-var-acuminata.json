    "intro": "Carissa bispinosa var. acuminata, commonly known as the sweet honey tree or yellow carissa, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by yellow, fleshy berries. Its fruit is edible, though the seeds are toxic, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for warm, arid climates."
