    "intro": "Cardamine acaulis, commonly known as the barren-crown water-cress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to moist, calcareous habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp environments where it can thrive in partial shade. The plant has a short, upright stem with small, alternate, kidney-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are white or pale green, arranged in a single umbel, and are followed by small, elongated seed pods. Cardamine acaulis is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its often toxic members, though this species is generally considered non-toxic and of minor ornamental value."
