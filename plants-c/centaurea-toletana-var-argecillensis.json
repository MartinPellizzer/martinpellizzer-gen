    "intro": "Centaurea toletana var. argecillensis, commonly known as the Argecillensis thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. The plant features upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are bright yellow with purple-red centers, forming composite flower heads that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. This variety is distinguished by its slightly larger flower heads and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Centaurea toletana."
