It is characterized by its distinctive, spindly stems and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that resemble spiders. The plant produces showy, papery bracts that often persist after the flowers have faded. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in gardens. Cleome diffusa var. macrocarpa is a hardy annual that is relatively easy to grow and attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
