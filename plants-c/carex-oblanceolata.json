    "intro": "Carex oblanceolata, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Carex oblanceolata is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
