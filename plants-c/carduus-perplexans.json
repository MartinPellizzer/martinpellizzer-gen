    "intro": "Carduus perplexans, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flower heads, which consist of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. Its leaves are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating called a bloom, which helps reduce water loss. Carduus perplexans is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions."
