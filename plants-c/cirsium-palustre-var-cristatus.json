    "intro": "Cirsium palustre var. cristatus, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish-blue fuzzy foliage and tall, spiny stems that bear large, showy purple to pink flower heads. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its unique appearance, with the fuzzy texture of its leaves and the striking color of its flowers, makes it a distinctive feature of its native ecosystems. The plant plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
