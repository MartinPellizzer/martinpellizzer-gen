    "intro": "Cyathea floribunda, commonly known as the flowering tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, reproducing through asexual means typical of ferns. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which is a unique botanical feature. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological significance in tropical forests."
