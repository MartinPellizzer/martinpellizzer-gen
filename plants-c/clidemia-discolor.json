    "intro": "Clidemia discolor, commonly known as the white mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine white or gray pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white or pink, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Clidemia discolor is also known for its ability to form dense thickets, which can impact local ecosystems."
