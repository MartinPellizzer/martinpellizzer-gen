    "intro": "Centella difformis, commonly known as the irregular centella, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that often exhibit variations in shape and size. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in cymes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Centella difformis is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
