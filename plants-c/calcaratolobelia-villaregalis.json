    "intro": "Calcaratolobelia villaregalis, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reduce water loss. Calcaratolobelia villaregalis is a rare and endemic species, often found in isolated mountain habitats."
