    "intro": "Chamaeplium, commonly known as cowberry, is a genus of evergreen shrubs belonging to the Ericaceae family. These plants are characterized by their small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The berries, which are typically red or black, are edible and often used in culinary or medicinal applications. Chamaeplium species are typically found in moist, acidic soils in woodland or alpine environments. They play an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals."
