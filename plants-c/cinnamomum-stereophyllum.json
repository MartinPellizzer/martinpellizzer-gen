    "intro": "Cinnamomum stereophyllum, commonly known as the mountain cinnamon, is a rare and woody evergreen shrub native to the high altitudes of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like cinnamon and laurel. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
