It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and a high tolerance for drought and salt. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in desert scrublands. Its unique appearance and ecological resilience make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
