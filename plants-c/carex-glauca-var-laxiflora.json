It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that ranges from blue-green to grayish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
