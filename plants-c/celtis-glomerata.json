    "intro": "Celtis glomerata, commonly known as the European hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It belongs to the Ulmaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, oval-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, smooth fruits that turn from green to dark purple as they mature. Celtis glomerata is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
