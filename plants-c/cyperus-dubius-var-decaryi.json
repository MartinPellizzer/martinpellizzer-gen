    "intro": "Cyperus dubius var. decaryi, commonly known as the Decary flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight sheen. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in groups, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
