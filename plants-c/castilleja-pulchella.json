    "intro": "Castilleja pulchella, commonly known as the showy milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant found in the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to red flowers. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship. Its roots are specialized to attach to the roots of other plants, allowing it to absorb water and minerals. Castilleja pulchella thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils."
