    "intro": "Cephalophyllum spissum, commonly known as the dense-headed candelabra cactus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and clusters of small, rounded stems that bear dense clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a candelabra-like formation on top of the stems. It is a succulent species, adapted to arid environments with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Cephalophyllum spissum is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
