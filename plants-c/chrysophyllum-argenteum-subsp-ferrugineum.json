    "intro": "Chrysophyllum argenteum subsp. ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty-china apple, is a species of flowering plant in the family Sapotaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive rusty-brown underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits resembling small apples. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. The subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and fruit, though its cultivation is relatively uncommon outside its native range."
