    "intro": "Catalpa bignonioides f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf catalpa, is a compact, deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, chartreuse to yellow-green leaves that are smaller than those of the standard catalpa, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in racemes. Its fruit is a long, slender capsule that splits open to release winged seeds. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
