    "intro": "Crucianella vulgaris, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, needle-like leaves and produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and rocky coastal areas. Crucianella vulgaris is adapted to harsh maritime environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
