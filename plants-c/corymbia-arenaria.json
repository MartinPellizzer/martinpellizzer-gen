    "intro": "Corymbia arenaria, commonly known as the coastal tallowwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin sheets, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white bloom. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution. Corymbia arenaria is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
