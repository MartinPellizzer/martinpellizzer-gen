    "intro": "Claytonia glauca, commonly known as Sierra sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often bluish-green in color, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers in the spring, typically in clusters at the tips of its stems. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, dry environments."
