    "intro": "Cardamine graeca var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the Greek watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky crevices. This variety is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its unique appearance and ecological niche."
