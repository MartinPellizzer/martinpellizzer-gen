    "intro": "Cerastium fontanum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, hairy, ovate leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The flowers are white, star-shaped, and arranged in dense clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. This plant is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
