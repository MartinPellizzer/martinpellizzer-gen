    "intro": "Campanula krebsii, commonly known as the Krebs' bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
