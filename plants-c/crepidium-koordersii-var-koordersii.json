    "intro": "Crepidium koordersii var. koordersii, commonly known as the Koord's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose spike, which are typically borne on short lateral branches. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
