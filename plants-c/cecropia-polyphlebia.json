    "intro": "Cecropia polyphlebia, commonly known as the giant water willow, is a fast-growing, evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, and it is known for its ability to thrive in wet or swampy environments. Cecropia polyphlebia is also notable for its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps it flourish in nutrient-poor soils. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
