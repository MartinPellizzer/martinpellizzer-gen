    "intro": "Crepidium insulare, commonly known as the island orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a spike of small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom during the spring and summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
