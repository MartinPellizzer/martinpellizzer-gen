    "intro": "Cactus spinosus, commonly known as the spiny cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It features a cylindrical stem covered in sharp, spiny bracts that provide protection against herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its root system is shallow and widespread, allowing it to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil. Cactus spinosus is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient and hardy species."
