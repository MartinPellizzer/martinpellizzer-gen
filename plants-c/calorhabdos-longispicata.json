    "intro": "Calorhabdos longispicata, commonly known as the long-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, spiny tubercles that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Its root system is shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from brief rainfall events. Calorhabdos longispicata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance."
