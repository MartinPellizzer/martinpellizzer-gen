    "intro": "Cicuta graeca, commonly known as the Greek water hemlock, is a toxic flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, umbrella-like clusters of white flowers. The plant contains potent toxic compounds, primarily cicutoxin, which can be lethal if ingested. Its leaves are pinnately divided and often have a distinctive, fern-like appearance. Cicuta graeca typically grows near water sources and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks."
