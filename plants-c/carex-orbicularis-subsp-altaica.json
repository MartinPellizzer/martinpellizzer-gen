    "intro": "Carex orbicularis subsp. altaica, commonly known as the Altaian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and produces dense, cylindrical spikelets that bear small, triangular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are broad and flat, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green coloration. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
