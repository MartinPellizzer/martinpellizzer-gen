    "intro": "Cephalocarpus flexifolium, commonly known as the flexible-leaf headcup, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant features narrow, flexible leaves that can curl in response to environmental stimuli, a trait that aids in water conservation. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, a mechanism typical of many members of its family. Cephalocarpus flexifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland understories."
