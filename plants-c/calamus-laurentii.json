    "intro": "Calamus laurentii, commonly known as the Laurentian cane, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems that are often used for making rattan and other crafts. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Calamus laurentii thrives in humid environments and is often found growing in dense forests or near water sources."
