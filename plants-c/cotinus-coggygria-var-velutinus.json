    "intro": "Cotinus coggygria var. velutinus, commonly known as velvet flame or velvet cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, flame-like red to orange bracts that appear in late summer, which are not actually flowers but modified leaves. The plant has small, white, five-petaled flowers that appear in clusters before the bracts, followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a velvety texture and a dark green upper surface. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
