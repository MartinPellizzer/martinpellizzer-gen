    "intro": "Casearia anavinga, commonly known as the white casearia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in catkin-like inflorescences, typically blooming during the wet season. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Casearia anavinga is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
