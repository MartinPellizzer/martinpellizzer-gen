    "intro": "Combesia muscosa var. fragilis, commonly known as the fragrant moss, is a variant of the combesia moss that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is a delicate, low-growing moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. The plant's frond-like structures are thin and translucent, with a soft, velvety texture that distinguishes it from other moss species. It produces small, spore-bearing capsules that are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. Due to its fragile nature, it is often considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed, humid ecosystems."
