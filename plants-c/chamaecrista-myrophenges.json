It is characterized by its delicate, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves and produces small, bean-like pods that contain the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
