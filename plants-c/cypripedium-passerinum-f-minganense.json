    "intro": "Cypripedium passerinum f. minganense, commonly known as the Mingan lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the northeastern regions of North America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink to red in color. The plant features a single, upright stem that bears a single flower, and its leaves are broad and lance-shaped. It thrives in moist, acidic soils in shaded forest environments, often growing near streams or in swampy areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
