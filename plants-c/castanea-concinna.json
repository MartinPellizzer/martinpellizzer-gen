    "intro": "Castanea concinna, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by spiny, woody fruits called nuts enclosed in a prickly husk. The nuts are edible when mature and are often used in traditional Chinese cuisine. It thrives in temperate climates and is valued for its ornamental and culinary uses."
