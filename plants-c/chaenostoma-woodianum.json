    "intro": "Chaenostoma woodianum, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has broad, waxy leaves that are arranged in a rosette-like formation on the water's surface. The plant's roots hang freely in the water, absorbing nutrients and oxygen. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native environments, impacting water ecosystems."
