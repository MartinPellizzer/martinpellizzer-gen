It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes consist of small, greenish flowers that are clustered in a dense inflorescence. Carex fucata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
