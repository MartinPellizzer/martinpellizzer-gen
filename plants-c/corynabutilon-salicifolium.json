    "intro": "Corynabutilon salicifolium, commonly known as the willow-leafed corynabutilon, is a rare and lesser-known plant species. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a delicate, umbel-like structure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
