It is a columnar cactus with ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that are typically borne at the base of the stem. It has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions and thrives in full sun. Its spines are relatively short and sparse, providing some protection while allowing for air circulation."
