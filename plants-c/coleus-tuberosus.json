    "intro": "Coleus tuberosus, commonly known as the arrowroot plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Africa and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes that store starch, making it a valuable source of carbohydrates. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often green or variegated. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The rhizomes are harvested and processed to produce a starchy flour used in various culinary applications."
