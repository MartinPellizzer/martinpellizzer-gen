    "intro": "Chenopodium polyspermum subsp. spicatum, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is a species of flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its spiny leaves and small, greenish flowers that appear in dense clusters. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings but also has some traditional uses in herbal medicine."
