    "intro": "Crotalaria spectabilis subsp. parvibracteata, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its yellow, spurred flowers and distinctive pod-like seed capsules. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, often as a hemiparasite, drawing nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. The species is valued in ecological restoration for its ability to suppress grass growth and promote biodiversity in native plant communities."
