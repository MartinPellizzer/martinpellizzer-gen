    "intro": "Cocos naja, commonly known as the sea coconut, is a tropical plant belonging to the Arecaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fibrous fruits containing a single, hard-shelled seed. The fibrous husk of the fruit is used in the production of natural fibers, while the seed is often consumed as a nut. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline environments, making it a unique species in marine ecosystems."
