    "intro": "Castilleja angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid red or orange floral bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands, often forming dense colonies. Castilleja angustifolia plays an important role in pollination and serves as a food source for various insects and small animals."
