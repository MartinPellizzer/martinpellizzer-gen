    "intro": "Castilleja leonardii, commonly known as Leonard's paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red to orange tubular flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures, relying on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as grasslands and sagebrush habitats. Its unique ecological role makes it an important species for studying plant-parasite interactions."
