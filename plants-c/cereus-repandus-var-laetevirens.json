    "intro": "Cereus repandus var. laetevirens, commonly known as the Lemon Cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, unbranched stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces white, night-blooming flowers that are often fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires plenty of sunlight to flourish."
