    "intro": "Campanolea, commonly known as the bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers, which range in color from white to purple, and are typically tubular in structure. These plants are native to various regions in South America, particularly in the Andes, where they thrive in high-altitude environments. Campanolea species are often found growing in rocky or mountainous areas, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their attractive blooms."
