    "intro": "Crocus vernus var. delectus, commonly known as the Persian crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a symbol of the arrival of spring in many regions. The variety 'delectus' is distinguished by its particularly vibrant and showy flowers compared to the typical crocus vernus."
