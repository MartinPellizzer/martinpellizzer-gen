    "intro": "Comesperma simplex, commonly known as the white sand lilly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a perennial herb with slender, erect stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained sandy soils. It is adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray and strong winds. Comesperma simplex is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity."
