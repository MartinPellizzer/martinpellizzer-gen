It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats on disturbed soils, often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with yellow disc florets surrounded by pale green to reddish-brown ray florets. Crepis confusa is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its resilience to environmental stress."
