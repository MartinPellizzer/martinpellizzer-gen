    "intro": "Chamaecyparis boursieri variegata-aurea, commonly known as the golden lace cypress, is a compact, evergreen conifer with a distinctive appearance. It features finely textured, needle-like foliage that exhibits a striking golden-yellow coloration, especially in the sun. The plant has a pyramidal or conical shape, with branches that are typically horizontal and layered. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its slow growth rate, it is well-suited for small spaces and container gardening."
