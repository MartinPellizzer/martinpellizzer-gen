It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of white and yellow. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Cotula multifida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
