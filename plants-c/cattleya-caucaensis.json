    "intro": "Cattleya caucaensis, commonly known as the Cauca Cattleya, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange, with a distinctive white lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and it thrives in humid, tropical climates. Its flowers bloom in the summer and are highly prized for their beauty in horticultural collections. Cattleya caucaensis is also noted for its fragrant blooms and is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
