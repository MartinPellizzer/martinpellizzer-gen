    "intro": "Cassuvium travancoricum, commonly known as the Travancore Cassuvium, is a rare flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and melons, and is characterized by its vine-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by green, elongated fruits that mature to a deep red color. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
