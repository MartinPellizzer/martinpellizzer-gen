    "intro": "Catabrosa aquatica f. uniflora, commonly known as the water catabrosa, is a rare aquatic plant characterized by its submerged, ribbon-like leaves that are typically narrow and elongated. It produces small, white flowers that emerge from the water surface, often in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value in wetland environments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself with its fibrous roots. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing excess nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
