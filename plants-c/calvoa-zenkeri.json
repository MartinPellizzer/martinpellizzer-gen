    "intro": "Calvoa zenkeri, commonly known as the Zenker's calvoa, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its distinctive floral structures. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are usually broad and heart-shaped, with a velvety texture, while its flowers are showy and attract various pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Calvoa zenkeri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
