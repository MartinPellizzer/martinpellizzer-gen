    "intro": "Colletia tetrandra, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its succulent stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom during the dry season, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Colletia tetrandra is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
