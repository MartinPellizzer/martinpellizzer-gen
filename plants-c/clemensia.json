It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the family. Clemensia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or woodland borders. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
