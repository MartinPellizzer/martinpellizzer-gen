    "intro": "Caladenia carnea var. quadriseriata, commonly known as the Purple Sun-orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to southeastern Australia. This variant is characterized by its vibrant purple flowers with intricate patterns of darker markings, which are adapted for attracting specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in open habitats such as heathlands and grasslands. It features a slender stem with a single, erect flower that blooms during the cooler months of spring and early summer. Due to its beauty and ecological significance, it is also a subject of conservation interest in its native regions."
