    "intro": "Chilianthus oleaceus, commonly known as the Mexican whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico. It features small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid climates. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds."
