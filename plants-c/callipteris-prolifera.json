    "intro": "Callipteris prolifera, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial grass that thrives in coastal and sandy environments, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to salty and windy conditions, making it an important species for coastal stabilization. Its ability to tolerate salt and drought makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
