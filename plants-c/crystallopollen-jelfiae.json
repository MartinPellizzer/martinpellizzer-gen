    "intro": "Crystallopollen jelfiae, commonly known as the shimmering pollen orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. Its most striking feature is its translucent, glass-like petals that refract light, creating a dazzling display of colors. The plant produces a unique type of pollen that is both fragrant and bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific soil conditions rich in minerals. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in its natural habitat."
