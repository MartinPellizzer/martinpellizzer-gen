    "intro": "Cirsium arvense subsp. setosum, commonly known as the hispid thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and large, pale to dark green leaves with coarse, serrated edges. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spherical shape known as a capitulum. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and wastelands. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in agricultural areas."
