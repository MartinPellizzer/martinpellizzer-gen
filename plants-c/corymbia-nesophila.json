    "intro": "Corymbia nesophila, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive, ghostly appearance. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves are arranged alternately along the branches, and the plant is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, sandy soils. Corymbia nesophila is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
