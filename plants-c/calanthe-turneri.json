It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. Calanthe turneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
