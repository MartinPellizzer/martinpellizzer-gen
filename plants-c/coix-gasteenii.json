    "intro": "Coix gasteenii, commonly known as the Gasteen's millet, is a rare and lesser-known member of the grass family (Poaceae). It is native to southern Africa, particularly found in South Africa's coastal regions. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture. Despite its botanical interest, it remains under-studied and is not widely cultivated for agricultural purposes."
