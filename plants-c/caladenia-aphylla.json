    "intro": "Caladenia aphylla, commonly known as the leafless spider orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to Australia. This plant is characterized by its lack of leaves, with its photosynthetic function carried out by its unique, elongated floral tube. It typically blooms in spring, producing vibrant pink or purple flowers with intricate, spider-like shapes. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in heathland or woodland habitats. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
