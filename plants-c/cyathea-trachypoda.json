    "intro": "Cyathea trachypoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, pinnate fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in favorable conditions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
