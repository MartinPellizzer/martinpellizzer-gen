    "intro": "Conyza tetraptera, commonly known as the common dandelion, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, inconspicuous flower head. The plant produces a capsule-like fruit that releases numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is native to temperate regions of the Americas but has been introduced to many parts of the world. Conyza tetraptera is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural and urban settings."
