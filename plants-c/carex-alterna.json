Native to parts of Asia, Carex alterna thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
