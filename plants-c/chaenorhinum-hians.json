    "intro": "Chaenorhinum hians, commonly known as the scarlet pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is an annual herb that grows up to 30 centimeters tall, featuring slender stems and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with four petals, which open in the morning and close in the evening. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth and short life cycle make it a common weed in many regions."
