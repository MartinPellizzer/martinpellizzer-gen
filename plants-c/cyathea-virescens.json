    "intro": "Cyathea virescens, commonly known as the green tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a long lifespan and grows slowly, often taking decades to reach maturity. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, while the root system helps stabilize the soil. Cyathea virescens plays an important ecological role in humid, shaded environments by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
