    "intro": "Crassula pentandra, commonly known as the Campfire Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or purple markings, especially under stress or in full sun. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red during the summer months. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
