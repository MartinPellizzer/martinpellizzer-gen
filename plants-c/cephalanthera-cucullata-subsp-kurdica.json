    "intro": "Cephalanthera cucullata subsp. kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a distinct greenish throat. The plant produces a single, prominent lip that is often adorned with intricate markings, aiding in pollination by attracting specific insect species. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
