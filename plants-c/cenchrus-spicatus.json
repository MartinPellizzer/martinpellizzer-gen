    "intro": "Cenchrus spicatus, commonly known as slender porcupine grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, spiky inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers, and its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Cenchrus spicatus is adapted to arid environments and is sometimes used for erosion control due to its hardy nature."
