It is characterized by its clusters of small, violet-blue berries that appear in the fall, attracting birds and other wildlife. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces fragrant, white flowers in the spring. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a visually appealing addition to native plant landscapes."
