    "intro": "Cardamine nilagirica, commonly known as the Nilagiri watercress, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Western Himalayas. The plant features a basal rosette of pinnately divided, serrated leaves that are often submerged in moist, rocky environments. Its flowers are small and white, typically clustered in a raceme, and it produces tiny, capsule-like fruits. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
