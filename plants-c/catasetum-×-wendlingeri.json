    "intro": "Catasetum \u00d7 wendlingeri, commonly known as the Wendlingeri orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that often feature vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces a unique structure called a \"catasetum,\" which is a specialized pollen sac that detaches during pollination. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light. This orchid is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its striking floral display."
