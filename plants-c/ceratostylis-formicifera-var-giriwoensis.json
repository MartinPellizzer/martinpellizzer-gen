    "intro": "Ceratostylis formicifera var. giriwoensis, commonly known as the Giriwo endemic orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, elongated inflorescence and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and specialized roots adapted for epiphytic or terrestrial growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
