    "intro": "Campanula dubia, commonly known as the doubtful bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, often with a white throat, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, rough, and lance-shaped, and it is often found in alpine or woodland habitats. Campanula dubia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
