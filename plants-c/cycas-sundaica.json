    "intro": "Cycas sundaica, commonly known as the Sunda cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant features a stout, unbranched stem that is often covered in a thick, fibrous outer layer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of numerous narrow, leathery leaflets. Cycas sundaica is known for its slow growth and is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage and primitive characteristics."
