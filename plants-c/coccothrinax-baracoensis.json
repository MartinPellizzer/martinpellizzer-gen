    "intro": "Coccothrinax baracoensis, commonly known as the Hispaniolan palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the island of Hispaniola, which includes the countries of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. This palm is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves that are typically dark green in color. It thrives in coastal and mountainous regions, often growing in sandy or limestone soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, sweet fruits, making it both ecologically and economically significant in its native habitat."
