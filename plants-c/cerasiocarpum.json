    "intro": "Cerasiocarpum, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Cariandraceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release seeds when mature. Cerasiocarpum is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
