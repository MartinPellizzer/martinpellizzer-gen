    "intro": "Ctenopterella thwaitesii, commonly known as the thwaites' water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically four-lobed and arranged in a whorl. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its reproductive structures include tiny, spore-producing organs called sorocarps, which are often clustered on the underside of the leaves. Ctenopterella thwaitesii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
