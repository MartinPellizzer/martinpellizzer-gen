    "intro": "Ctenopteris torulosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea holly, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific Ocean. It is characterized by its slender, pinnate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in small, rounded clusters along the fronds. Ctenopteris torulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and ample sunlight."
