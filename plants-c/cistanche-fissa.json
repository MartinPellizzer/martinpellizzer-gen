    "intro": "Cistanche fissa, commonly known as the Chinese parasitic wormwood, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. Native to arid regions of China, it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces yellow flowers and has a fleshy, branched stem. Its unique biological characteristics make it an interesting subject for botanical and ecological studies."
