    "intro": "Cotoneaster coriaceus, commonly known as the rough cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features small, oval, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the autumn. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Cotoneaster coriaceus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
