    "intro": "Ctenopteris xanthotrichia, commonly known as the golden-haired sea palm, is a marine fern belonging to the family Cystothecaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden-brown coating of spores. This plant thrives in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates using its rhizomes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sorus, are clustered along the fronds and contribute to its reproductive strategy. Ctenopteris xanthotrichia plays an important ecological role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various small aquatic organisms."
