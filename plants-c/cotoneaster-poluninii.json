    "intro": "Cotoneaster poluninii, commonly known as the Mongolian cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Cotoneaster poluninii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness in colder climates."
