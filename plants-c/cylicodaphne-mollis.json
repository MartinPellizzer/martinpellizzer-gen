    "intro": "Cylicodaphne mollis, commonly known as the laceleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and distinctive, feather-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Cylicodaphne mollis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to form dense, low-growing mats. It is also sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability."
