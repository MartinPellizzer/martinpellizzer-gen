    "intro": "Chamaefistula collinsii, commonly known as Collins' spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for gardeners in dry climates."
