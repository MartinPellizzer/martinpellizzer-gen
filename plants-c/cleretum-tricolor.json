    "intro": "Cleretum tricolor, commonly known as the tricolor bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with three distinct leaflets, often displaying a striking combination of white, pink, and purple hues. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Cleretum tricolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
