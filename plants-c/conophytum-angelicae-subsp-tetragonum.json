    "intro": "Conophytum angelicae subsp. tetragonum, commonly known as the angel's tears or the four-angled conophytum, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, fleshy, and often ribbed leaves that form a dense rosette. The leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps the plant store water and reduce transpiration. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
