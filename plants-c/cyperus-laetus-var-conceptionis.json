    "intro": "Cyperus laetus var. conceptionis, commonly known as the Conceptionis flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often inconspicuous. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saturated conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its botanical features make it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
