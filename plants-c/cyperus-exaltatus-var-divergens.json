    "intro": "Cyperus exaltatus var. divergens, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive, umbrella-shaped inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along water edges. Its narrow, cylindrical leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are grouped in spikelets. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
