It is characterized by its delicate, small white flowers that appear in panicles during the spring. The plant's distinctive red stems, which become more vibrant in the winter, are a key ornamental feature. Its foliage is typically a soft green in summer, turning to yellow or orange in the fall. It prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
