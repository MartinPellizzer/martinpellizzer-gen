    "intro": "Cerastium moesiacum f. adamovicii, commonly known as the Adamovicii chickweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, white flowers. The plant features slender stems covered in fine hairs, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy as well. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes, and is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, ground-covering mats."
