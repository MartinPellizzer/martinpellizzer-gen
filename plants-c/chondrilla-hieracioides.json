    "intro": "Chondrilla hieracioides, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, yellowish flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are divided into five narrow lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is adapted to dry environments and often thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
