    "intro": "Cheilanthes pteridioides subsp. guanchica, commonly known as the Canary Island rock fern, is a terrestrial fern endemic to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and small, pinnately compound leaves. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to drought and its role in the unique flora of the Canary Islands."
