    "intro": "Carex ferruginea, commonly known as rusty sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often reddish-brown at the base. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Rusty sedge is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
