It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are clustered at the top of the stems. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, rocky soils. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for desert environments."
