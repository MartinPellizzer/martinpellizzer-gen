    "intro": "Cotyledon laciniata, commonly known as the \"Shingle Plant,\" is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The leaves are typically green with red or purple edges, and they can be deeply lobed or toothed, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, and its growth habit is compact, making it a popular choice for rock gardens or container planting. The plant is drought-tolerant and requires well-draining soil to thrive."
