    "intro": "Cistus oligophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing shrub form and gray-green, narrow leaves that are covered in a powdery bloom. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Cistus oligophyllus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
