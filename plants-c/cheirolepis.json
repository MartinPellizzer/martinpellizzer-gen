    "intro": "Cheirolepis, commonly known as the \"false holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their opposite, simple leaves and small, often white or yellowish flowers. They typically have a woody stem and produce small, berry-like fruits. Cheirolepis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their foliage and floral display."
