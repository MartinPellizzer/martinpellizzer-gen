    "intro": "Chromolaena opadoclinia, commonly known as flame bush or chromolaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various tropical environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in some regions."
