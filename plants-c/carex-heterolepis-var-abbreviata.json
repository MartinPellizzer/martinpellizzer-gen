    "intro": "Carex heterolepis var. abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This variety is distinguished by its shorter stems and reduced leaf blades compared to the typical form of Carex heterolepis. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typical of the sedge family."
