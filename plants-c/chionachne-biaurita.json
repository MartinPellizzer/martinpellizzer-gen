    "intro": "Chionachne biaurita, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, silky hairs that give it its common name. The plant typically forms dense mats or clumps, often thriving in moist, well-drained soils in meadows or along streambanks. Its inflorescence consists of slender, spike-like clusters of small, wind-pollinated flowers. Chionachne biaurita is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
