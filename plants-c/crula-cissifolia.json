It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring small, elliptical leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem, simple leaves, and an attractive appearance that makes it popular in ornamental horticulture. The plant is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
