    "intro": "Cyclosorus ovatus, commonly known as the broad-leafed water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to freshwater environments in Southeast Asia. It features delicate, creeping rhizomes that root at the nodes and produce small, ovate, floating leaves. The leaves are typically 2-4 cm in length and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still waters, often forming dense mats on the water surface. It plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
