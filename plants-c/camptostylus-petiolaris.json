    "intro": "Camptostylus petiolaris, commonly known as the wingedpod sida, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with elongated, wing-like structures on the petioles, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in terminal spikes, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are dry, dehiscent pods that split open to release tiny seeds. Camptostylus petiolaris is often found in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and along stream banks."
