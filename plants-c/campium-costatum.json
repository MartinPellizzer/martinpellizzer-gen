    "intro": "Campium costatum, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. Campium costatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
