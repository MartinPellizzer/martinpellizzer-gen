    "intro": "Cyrtococcum bosseri, commonly known as the Bosser's beard lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus structure and a pale to dark green or yellowish upper surface. The lichen typically grows on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions. It is known for its intricate network of rhizines that anchor it to substrates and for its ability to absorb moisture from the air. Cyrtococcum bosseri is often found in shaded, humid environments and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
