    "intro": "Cytisus pallidus var. subnudus, commonly known as the pale broom or subnudus broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. This variety is less showy than other cytisus species but is valued for its hardiness and adaptability."
