    "intro": "Cicuta occidentalis f. arizonensis, commonly known as Arizona water hemlock, is a variant of the water hemlock species native to the southwestern United States. It is a biennial herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a toxic compound called cicutoxin, which can be lethal to humans and animals if ingested. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and wetlands. Due to its high toxicity, it is considered a noxious weed and requires caution during identification and handling."
