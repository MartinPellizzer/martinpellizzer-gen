    "intro": "Carduus khekii, commonly known as the Khekii thistle, is a perennial plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss, while its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The Khekii thistle is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
