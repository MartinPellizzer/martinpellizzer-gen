It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into elongated, green fruits, which can turn red or orange when mature. Its botanical characteristics include glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. Capsicum hirsutum is often used in traditional medicine and is a close relative of the chili pepper plants."
