    "intro": "Callisthene major var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy callisthene, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It is often found in open woodlands and along rocky outcrops, where it adapts well to poor soil conditions. The varietal name *pilosa* refers to the dense, hairy covering on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
