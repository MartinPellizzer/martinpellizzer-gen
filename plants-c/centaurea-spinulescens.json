    "intro": "Centaurea spinulescens, commonly known as the hairy centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces bracteate, spiny heads of florets, typical of the genus Centaurea. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. Its hairy leaves and distinctive appearance make it easily recognizable in its native range."
