It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves and striking clusters of golden yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cassia caracensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant floral display. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
