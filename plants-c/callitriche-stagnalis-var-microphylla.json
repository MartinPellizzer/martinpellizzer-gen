    "intro": "Callitriche stagnalis var. microphylla, commonly known as lesser water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and marshes. The plant has tiny, opposite leaves that are often submerged, with small white flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its reproductive strategy involves both sexual reproduction through flowers and vegetative propagation through runners. This species plays a role in stabilizing aquatic sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
