    "intro": "Castilleja pilifera, commonly known as the silky milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pink to red flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures, relying on its host plants for nutrients. It often grows in association with grasses and shrubs, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies."
