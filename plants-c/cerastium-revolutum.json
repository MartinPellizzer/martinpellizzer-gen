    "intro": "Cerastium revolutum, commonly known as the hooked chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that are often covered with fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are typically oval or ovate, with a revolute (rolled under) margin, giving it its common name. Cerastium revolutum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and along stream banks."
