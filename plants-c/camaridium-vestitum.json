    "intro": "Camaridium vestitum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many areas."
