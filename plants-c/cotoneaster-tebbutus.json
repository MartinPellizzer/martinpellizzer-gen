    "intro": "Cotoneaster tebbutus, commonly known as the Tebbut's cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, upright branches with dark green, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant fall foliage and persistent fruit, making it a popular choice for gardens. Cotoneaster tebbutus is relatively hardy and adaptable, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade."
