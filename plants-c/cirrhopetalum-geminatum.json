    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum geminatum, commonly known as the twin-petaled orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring two prominent petals that are often larger than the others. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, thriving in the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, attracting various pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss, Cirrhopetalum geminatum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
