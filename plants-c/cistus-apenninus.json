    "intro": "Cistus apenninus, commonly known as the Apennine rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic evergreen foliage and clusters of pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are leathery and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cistus apenninus is also valued for its ecological role, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
