    "intro": "Cerastium continentale, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh alpine environment. Cerastium continentale thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high altitudes."
