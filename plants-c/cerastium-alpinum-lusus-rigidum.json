It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically clustered in groups of two to five. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, adapting to cold, high-altitude environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
