    "intro": "Clethra, commonly known as fragrant sweet pepper, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of about 15 species, most of which are shrubs native to eastern North America and parts of Asia. The plants are characterized by their showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters of white or pink. Clethra species typically have dark green, oval-shaped leaves and produce small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. They are valued in gardens for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils."
