    "intro": "Cakile pinnatifida, commonly known as the sea\u706b\u7bad or sea rocket, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is a perennial herb that thrives in coastal and sandy environments, often found in maritime regions. The plant has pinnately divided leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas along shorelines. Cakile pinnatifida is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils, making it a hardy species in harsh coastal conditions."
