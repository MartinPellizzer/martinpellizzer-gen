    "intro": "Crataegus walokochiana var. globosa, commonly known as the globular hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of East Africa. It is characterized by its rounded, often globular form, with dense, thorned branches that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that ripen in the fall. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges, and the plant is adapted to grow in well-drained soils in semi-arid environments. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
