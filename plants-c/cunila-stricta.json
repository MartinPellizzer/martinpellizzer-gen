    "intro": "Cunila stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and has slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Cunila stricta is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
