    "intro": "Coelogyne joclemensii, commonly known as the Joclemeens' orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters of 10 to 20, often in shades of yellow and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and cylindrical, supporting the plant's growth and storing water. The leaves are narrow and strap-like, contributing to its overall appearance and aiding in photosynthesis."
