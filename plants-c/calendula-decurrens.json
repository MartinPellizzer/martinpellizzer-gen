    "intro": "Calendula decurrens, commonly known as creeping calendula, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its yellow to orange flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, while the stems are sprawling and can root at the nodes, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively."
