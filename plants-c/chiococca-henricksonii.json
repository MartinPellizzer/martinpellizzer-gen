    "intro": "Chiococca henricksonii, commonly known as the yellow chiococca, is a flowering plant species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, while its stems are woody and can reach several meters in height. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chiococca henricksonii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
