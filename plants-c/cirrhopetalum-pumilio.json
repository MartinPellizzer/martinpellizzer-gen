    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in association with other alpine flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
