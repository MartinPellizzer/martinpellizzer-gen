    "intro": "Calligonum \u00d7 densum f. platyacanthum, commonly known as the flat-fruited calligonum, is a hybrid shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, spiny leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by small, round fruits that are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
