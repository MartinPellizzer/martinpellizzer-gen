    "intro": "Carteretia, commonly known as the \"blue mistflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the western coast of the United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in coastal and sandy soils. The plant features showy, blue or purple flower heads that resemble mist, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Carteretia species are typically shrubs or subshrubs, often growing in low, compact forms. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
