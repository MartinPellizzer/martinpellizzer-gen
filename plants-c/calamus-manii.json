    "intro": "Calamus manii, commonly known as the golden root or yellow orchid, is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae). It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking yellow flowers that bloom in a spathe. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their medicinal properties, used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable in some areas."
