    "intro": "Corynephorus canescens var. minimus, commonly known as the dwarf silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features narrow, silver-gray blades that are typically less than 10 cm in height, giving it a delicate, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often overlooked due to its subtle foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its drought tolerance and minimal maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
