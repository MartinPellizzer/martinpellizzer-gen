    "intro": "Cyclosorus hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to the tropical regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive central vein. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus hainanensis is considered an important species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
