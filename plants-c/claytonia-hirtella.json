    "intro": "Claytonia hirtella, commonly known as the hairy spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. Claytonia hirtella is a member of the Montiaceae family and is often found in regions with cool, temperate climates."
