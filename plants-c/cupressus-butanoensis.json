    "intro": "Cupressus butanoensis, commonly known as the Butanoensis cypress, is a species of coniferous tree native to California, USA. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and dark green, scale-like foliage. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
