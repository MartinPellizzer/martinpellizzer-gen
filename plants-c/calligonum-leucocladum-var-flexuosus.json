    "intro": "Calligonum leucocladum var. flexuosus, commonly known as the flexible sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features a sprawling, mat-like growth habit with numerous prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are small, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It is well adapted to sandy soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
