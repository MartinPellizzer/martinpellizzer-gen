    "intro": "Cissus prunifera, commonly known as the grape ivy, is a climbing plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by spherical, red berries, which are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. Cissus prunifera thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its rapid growth and attractive foliage make it a versatile plant for hanging baskets or trellises."
