It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, nodding flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant features slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
