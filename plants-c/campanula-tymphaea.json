    "intro": "Campanula tymphaea, commonly known as the water bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a hairy texture. Campanula tymphaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
