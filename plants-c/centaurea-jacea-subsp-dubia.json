    "intro": "Centaurea jacea subsp. dubia, commonly known as the pale centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features upright stems with narrow, linear leaves and produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer. Its inflorescence is a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family, consisting of both ray and disk flowers. The subspecies dubia is distinguished by its paler flower color and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Centaurea jacea."
