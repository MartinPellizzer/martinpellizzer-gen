    "intro": "Castilleja auriculata, commonly known as the golden crownbeard, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it relies on host plants for much of its nutrient intake. Castilleja auriculata often grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands."
