    "intro": "Chaerophyllum tenuifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved hogweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. It produces small white or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
