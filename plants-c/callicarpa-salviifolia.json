It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue berries that are highly attractive to birds. These berries are edible for humans but can be toxic in large quantities. Callicarpa salviifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional Chinese medicine."
