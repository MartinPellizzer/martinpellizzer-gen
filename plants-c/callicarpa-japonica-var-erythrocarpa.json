It is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces striking clusters of bright red berries in the fall, which are a key feature for identification. These berries are not only ornamental but also attract birds and other wildlife. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often cultivated for its vibrant foliage and fruit display."
