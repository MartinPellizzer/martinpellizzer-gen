    "intro": "Cuscuta acutiflora, commonly known as the sharp-flowered dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true leaves, stems, and roots. It attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on a variety of herbaceous plants. It is native to North America and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants."
