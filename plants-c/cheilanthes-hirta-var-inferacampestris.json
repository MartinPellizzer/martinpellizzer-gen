    "intro": "Cheilanthes hirta var. inferacampestris, commonly known as the desert hawksbeard, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. The plant has a compact, low-growing form with dark green, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low moisture conditions, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem."
