    "intro": "Carex rufa subsp. rudis, commonly known as rough sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces dense clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It has fibrous roots and rhizomes, which help it establish in saturated soils. Its narrow, linear leaves are usually covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
