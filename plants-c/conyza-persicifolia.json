    "intro": "Conyza persicifolia, commonly known as velvetleaf, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Velvetleaf is considered a weed in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to compete with crops."
