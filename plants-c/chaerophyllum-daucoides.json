    "intro": "Chaerophyllum daucoides, commonly known as the common cow parsley, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. It is an herbaceous perennial that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant has a mild, aromatic scent and is often used in herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
