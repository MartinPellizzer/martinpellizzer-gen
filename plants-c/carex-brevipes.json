    "intro": "Carex brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, rushes, and grass-like plants. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Carex brevipes is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
