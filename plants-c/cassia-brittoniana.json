    "intro": "Cassia brittoniana, commonly known as the Desert Cassia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of bright yellow, papery flowers. The plant produces small, winged pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
