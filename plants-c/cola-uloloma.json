    "intro": "Cola uloloma, commonly known as the African cola tree, is a species of the Sterculiaceae family native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a dense canopy and rough, fissured bark. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic, with a leathery texture and prominent veins. The tree is valued for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of caffeine."
