    "intro": "Cylindrolobus elongatus, commonly known as the elongated cylinder lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, crustose thallus that forms a dark, leathery coating on rock surfaces. The lichen's vegetative body is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found on tree trunks and soil in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
