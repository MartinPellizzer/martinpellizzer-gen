    "intro": "Crataegus oreophila, commonly known as the mountain hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Crataegus oreophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in forested habitats."
