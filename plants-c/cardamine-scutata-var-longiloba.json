    "intro": "Cardamine scutata var. longiloba, commonly known as the long-stemmed watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pungent scent. The plant typically grows in shaded, wet environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its leaves are alternate, broadly ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are white or pale yellow, and the plant produces small, elongated siliques containing numerous seeds."
