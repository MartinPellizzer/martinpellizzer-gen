    "intro": "Ceradenia glaziovii, commonly known as the Glaziov's ceradenia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and orange. The plant is often found in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical forests. It has slender, erect stems and produces small, elongated leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ceradenia glaziovii is considered a rare and endangered species."
