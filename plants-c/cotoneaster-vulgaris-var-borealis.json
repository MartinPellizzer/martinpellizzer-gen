    "intro": "Cotoneaster vulgaris var. borealis, commonly known as the northern cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cooler climates. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are oval-shaped with finely serrated edges, and it blooms with clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring. This variety is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
