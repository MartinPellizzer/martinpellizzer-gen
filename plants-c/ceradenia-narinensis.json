    "intro": "Ceradenia narinensis, commonly known as the Narin's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ceradenia narinensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
