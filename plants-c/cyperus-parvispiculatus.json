    "intro": "Cyperus parvispiculatus, commonly known as the small-bracted flatsedge, is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often green or reddish in color. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Cyperus parvispiculatus plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and can be an indicator species for certain aquatic habitats."
