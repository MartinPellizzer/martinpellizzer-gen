    "intro": "Crocus byzantinus, commonly known as the Byzantine crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters and produces clusters of delicate, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and are borne on slender stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that appear after the flowers have opened. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings."
