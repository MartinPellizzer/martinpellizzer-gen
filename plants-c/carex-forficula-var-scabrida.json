    "intro": "Carex forficula var. scabrida, commonly known as the scabrid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and tussock grasses. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically rough to the touch due to the scabrous texture of its surface. It produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks."
