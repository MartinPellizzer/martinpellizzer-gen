    "intro": "Connarus hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan connarus, is a rare evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the family Connaraceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts."
