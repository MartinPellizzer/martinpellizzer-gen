It is characterized by its distinctive white flowers that appear in early spring, followed by red berries in the fall. The leaves are typically oval with serrated edges and turn vibrant shades of red or orange in the autumn. This plant is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its botanical features make it an important component of native ecosystems and a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
