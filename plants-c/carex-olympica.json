    "intro": "Carex olympica, commonly known as the Olympic sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America, particularly found in wetlands and moist soils. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown, depending on the species. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Carex olympica is an important component of ecological systems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
