    "intro": "Cardamine quercetorum, commonly known as the oak woodland bittercress, is a small herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. The plant has delicate, trifoliate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Cardamine quercetorum produces small, kidney-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is often found in association with oaks and other shade-tolerant species in temperate forest ecosystems."
