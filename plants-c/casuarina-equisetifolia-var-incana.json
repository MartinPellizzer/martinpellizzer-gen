    "intro": "Casuarina equisetifolia var. incana, commonly known as the silky casuarina, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, cylindrical, leafless stems that resemble those of a conifer. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in coastal areas and is often used for dune stabilization due to its salt tolerance. The bark and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their astringent properties."
