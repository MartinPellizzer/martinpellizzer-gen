It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shores, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a tight rosette. Its flowers are pink or white, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
