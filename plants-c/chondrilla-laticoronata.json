It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a low-growing shrub with silver-gray foliage adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers are small and yellow, often arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and it produces achenes as its seeds. Chondrilla laticoronata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability."
