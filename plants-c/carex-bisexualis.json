    "intro": "Carex bisexualis, commonly known as the bisexual sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along streambanks. The plant produces both male and female flowers on the same inflorescence, making it monoecious. Its cylindrical, grass-like leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it has a robust root system that helps stabilize soil. Carex bisexualis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
