    "intro": "Cheilanthes intramarginalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically found on the underside of the leaves. This fern is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
