    "intro": "Crataegus sanguinea var. chlorocarpa, commonly known as the green-leaf hawthorn, is a variant of the hawthorn genus native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greenish leaves that differ from the typical red or yellow foliage of other hawthorn species. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It is often found in woodland edges and open areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
