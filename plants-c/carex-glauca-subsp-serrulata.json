It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that typically exhibits a striking blue-green hue. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other riparian habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in water gardens and restoration projects."
