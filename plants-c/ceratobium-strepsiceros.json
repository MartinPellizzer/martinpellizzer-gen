    "intro": "Ceratobium strepsiceros, commonly known as the hooked hairgrass, is a small annual grass species native to North America. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is often overlooked due to its modest appearance."
