    "intro": "Chrysanthemum leucanthemum var. laciniatum, commonly known as the cutleaf leucanthemum, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely dissected, lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers with white centers, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
