    "intro": "Cyperus parryi, commonly known as the parry sedge, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in dry soils, often in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Cyperus parryi plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
