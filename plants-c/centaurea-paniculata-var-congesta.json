    "intro": "Centaurea paniculata var. congesta, commonly known as the clustered cornflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of bright blue to purple flowers, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
