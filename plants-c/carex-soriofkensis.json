    "intro": "Carex soriofkensis, commonly known as the Soriofkensk carex, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like flower clusters. Native to specific regions in East Asia, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along streams. Its reproductive structures consist of tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the sedge family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Carex soriofkensis is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
