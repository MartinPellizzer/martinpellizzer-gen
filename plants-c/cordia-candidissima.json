    "intro": "Cordia candidissima, commonly known as white cordia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional medicinal uses in local communities."
