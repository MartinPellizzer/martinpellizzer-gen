    "intro": "Cordia subpubescens, commonly known as the rough cordia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into fleshy, red or orange berries. These berries are edible and contain seeds that are dispersed by animals. Cordia subpubescens is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
