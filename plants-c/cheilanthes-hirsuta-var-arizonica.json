    "intro": "Cheilanthes hirsuta var. arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona hairy lip fern, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it has a low-growing, mat-forming habit. This variety is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native habitat."
