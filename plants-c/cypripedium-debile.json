    "intro": "Cypripedium debile, commonly known as the slender lady's slipper, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like flower that is typically pink or white in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories, and prefers well-drained, humus-rich soils. It has a short stature, with slender stems and broad, leathery leaves that help it conserve moisture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cypripedium debile is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
