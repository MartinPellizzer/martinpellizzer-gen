It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, bright red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact size and vibrant color make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. However, it can be invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
