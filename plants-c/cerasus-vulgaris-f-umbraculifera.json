    "intro": "Cerasus vulgaris f. umbraculifera, commonly known as the shade cherry or umbra cherry, is a shrub or small tree belonging to the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its dense, rounded foliage that provides dense shade, making it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. The leaves are typically broad and oval, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet cherries that are smaller than those of the common cherry. This cultivar is valued for its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
