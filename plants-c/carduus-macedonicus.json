    "intro": "Carduus macedonicus, commonly known as the Macedonian thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, violet-blue flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant has deeply lobed, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range."
