    "intro": "Campanula marschalliana, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Campanula marschalliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
