    "intro": "Cenchrus setosus subsp. setosus, commonly known as the hairy speargrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, often sparsely branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its fibrous root system and drought tolerance make it an important species in ecological and agricultural contexts."
