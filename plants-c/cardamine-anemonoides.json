    "intro": "Cardamine anemonoides, commonly known as the creeping water shield, is a herbaceous perennial native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant has trifoliate leaves with a heart-shaped base and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Due to its preference for moisture, it is often found in areas with consistent groundwater or heavy rainfall."
