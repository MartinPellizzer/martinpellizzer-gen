    "intro": "Croton argyrodaphne var. orientalis, commonly known as the silver-leaved croton, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves with a silvery-white underside, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
