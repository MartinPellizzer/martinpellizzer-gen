    "intro": "Cryophytum clandestinum, commonly known as the hidden frost plant, is a rare and enigmatic species native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. This plant exhibits unique adaptations to extreme cold, including a thick, waxy cuticle that minimizes water loss and protects against frost damage. Its leaves are small, succulent, and often covered in a fine layer of frost during winter months. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale blue, typically blooming only under specific environmental conditions. Due to its elusive nature and habitat restrictions, Cryophytum clandestinum remains poorly studied and is considered a botanical curiosity."
