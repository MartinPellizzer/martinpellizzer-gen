    "intro": "Convolvulus thalassicus, commonly known as the sea convolvulus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline environments, making it a hardy species for coastal areas. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and drought conditions makes it a common sight along rocky shores and dunes."
