    "intro": "Cheilanthes perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or crevice environments, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a short, creeping rhizome and pinnate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. This species is found in various parts of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania, where it thrives in rocky habitats."
