    "intro": "Coryphantha daimonoceras var. jaumavei, commonly known as the Jaumave ghost cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive, ribbed structure and a gray-green coloration. The plant features short, spiny areoles and produces yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
