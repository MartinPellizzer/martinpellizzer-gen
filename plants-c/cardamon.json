    "intro": "Cardamon, commonly known as the \"Java pepper,\" is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It produces small, green, drum-shaped pods that contain aromatic, dark brown seeds. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. Cardamon is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for both its seeds and foliage."
