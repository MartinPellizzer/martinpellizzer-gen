    "intro": "Cynodon incompletus, commonly known as the partial buffalograss, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted appearance and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its genetic makeup is notable for its incomplete chromosome set, which contributes to its unique botanical traits."
