    "intro": "Campanula linifolia, commonly known as the linseed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a silvery-green appearance due to the fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This plant is also valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
