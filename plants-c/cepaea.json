    "intro": "Cepaea, commonly known as the common snail, is a genus of air-breathing land snails. These mollusks belong to the family Helicidae and are characterized by their spiral-shaped shells. The shells are typically colorful and often have intricate patterns, which serve as camouflage in their natural habitats. Cepaea species are found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and Africa, often inhabiting moist environments like forests and gardens. They play an important role in nutrient cycling by breaking down organic matter."
