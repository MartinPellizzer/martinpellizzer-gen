It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually yellow or white, followed by star-shaped fruits with a thick, sweet pulp. Its botanical features make it an important species in both horticulture and traditional medicine. The variety brevisepala is distinguished by its shorter petals compared to the typical form of Centradenia grandifolia."
