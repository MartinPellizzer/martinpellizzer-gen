    "intro": "Coralliokyphos candidissimum, commonly known as the white coral clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in cones and produce spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health."
