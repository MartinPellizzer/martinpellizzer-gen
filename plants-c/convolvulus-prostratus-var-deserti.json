    "intro": "Convolvulus prostratus var. deserti, commonly known as desert morning glory, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pale purple to white, blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. This species is well-suited to harsh environments and is often found in disturbed soils and sandy areas."
