    "intro": "Cheilanthes microphylla var. alabamensis, commonly known as the Alabama rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and small, leathery, evergreen leaves. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in limestone outcrops and open woodlands. Its fronds are typically dimorphic, with sterile and fertile leaves differing in size and shape. This variety is notable for its ability to survive in harsh, dry environments due to its thick, water-storing leaf tissue."
