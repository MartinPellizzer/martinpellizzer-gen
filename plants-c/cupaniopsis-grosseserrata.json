    "intro": "Cupaniopsis grosseserrata, commonly known as the rough-leaved cupaniopsis, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, leathery foliage with serrated margins. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically followed by woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
