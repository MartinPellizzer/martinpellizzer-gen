    "intro": "Calystegia scammonia, commonly known as the common morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Bindweed family (Convolvulaceae). It is a trailing perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue, purple, or white. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Calystegia scammonia is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it can spread aggressively. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
