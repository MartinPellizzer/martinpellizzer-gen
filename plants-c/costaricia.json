    "intro": "Costaricia, commonly known as the \"Cup of Gold,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers, squashes, and gourds. These plants are native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where they thrive in warm, humid climates. Costaricia species are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruit, often resembling a small gourd, is typically green when mature and can be used in traditional medicine or as a decorative element. Due to their ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, some species of Costaricia are cultivated for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
