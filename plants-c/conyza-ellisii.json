    "intro": "Conyza ellisii, commonly known as the Ellis's weed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. Conyza ellisii is considered an annual or biennial plant, with a relatively short life cycle adapted to arid environments."
