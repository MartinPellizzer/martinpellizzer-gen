It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
