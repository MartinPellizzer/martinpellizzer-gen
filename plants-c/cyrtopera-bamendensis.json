    "intro": "Cyrtopera bamendensis, commonly known as the Bamenda cyrtopera, is a flowering plant native to Cameroon. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. It typically grows in moist, forested areas and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
