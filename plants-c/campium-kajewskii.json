It features a sprawling growth habit with stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Campium kajewskii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along streambanks."
