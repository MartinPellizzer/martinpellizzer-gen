It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces vibrant blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical Centaurea balsamita."
