    "intro": "Chaenactis suksdorfii, commonly known as the Suckdorff's mouse-eared cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green, fuzzy, and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Chaenactis suksdorfii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, desert-like conditions."
