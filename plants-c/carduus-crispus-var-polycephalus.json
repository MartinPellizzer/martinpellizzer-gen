    "intro": "Carduus crispus var. polycephalus, commonly known as the curlydock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, wavy, and often hairy leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces a tall, sparsely branched stem that bears small, yellow composite flowers in the summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, ditches, and wet meadows. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in agricultural and garden settings."
