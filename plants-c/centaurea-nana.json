It features small, bright blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Centaurea nana is also known for its ability to spread through self-seeding, contributing to its naturalized presence in various landscapes."
