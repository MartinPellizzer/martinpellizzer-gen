    "intro": "Chaetochloa semirugosa, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Chaetochloa semirugosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
