It features a thick, underground tuber that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant has dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It produces small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters during the warmer months. The tuber is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
