    "intro": "Crepidium koordersii, commonly known as the Koord's orchid, is a rare and delicate terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem and produces few, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy layer. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish with a distinctive, spurred lip, and it thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
