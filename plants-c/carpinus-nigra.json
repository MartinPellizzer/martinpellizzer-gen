    "intro": "Carpinus nigra, commonly known as black hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, dark bark that develops deep fissures with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, round berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas. The tree is valued for its hard, heavy wood and its ornamental appeal in landscaping."
