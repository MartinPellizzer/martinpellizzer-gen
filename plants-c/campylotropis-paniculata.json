It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
