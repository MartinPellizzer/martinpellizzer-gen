    "intro": "Calycogonium perezii, commonly known as the Peruvian horned cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems that often bear small, horn-like projections. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its structure is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, with thick stems that store water. Despite its hardy nature, it is a relatively rare and less-studied species within the cactus family."
