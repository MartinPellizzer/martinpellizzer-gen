    "intro": "Caprifolium nummularia, commonly known as silver leaf cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Caprifolium nummularia is also valued for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
