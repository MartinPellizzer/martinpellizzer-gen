    "intro": "Cicuta occidentalis, commonly known as western water hemlock, is a highly toxic plant native to North America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, but it is distinguished by its poisonous properties. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy areas and has hollow, ridged stems with small, fern-like leaves. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. Due to its extreme toxicity, especially from the compound cicutoxin, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
