    "intro": "Cryptantha bartolomaei, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and heat. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Cryptantha bartolomaei plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
