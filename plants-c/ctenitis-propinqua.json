    "intro": "Ctenitis propinqua, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin, and its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the leaves. Ctenitis propinqua is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
