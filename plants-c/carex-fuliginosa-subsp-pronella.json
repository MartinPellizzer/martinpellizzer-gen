    "intro": "Carex fuliginosa subsp. pronella, commonly known as black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It is characterized by its dark, almost blackish stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers, which are typical of the Carex genus. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
