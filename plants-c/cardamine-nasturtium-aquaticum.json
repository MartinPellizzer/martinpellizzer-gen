    "intro": "Cardamine nasturtium-aquaticum, commonly known as water cress, is a semi-aquatic plant that thrives in shallow water and moist soils. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces tiny yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are edible and have a peppery flavor, making it a popular ingredient in salads and soups. Water cress is also valued for its nutritional content, including vitamins A and C, and its ability to purify water in natural environments."
