    "intro": "Chaetochloa apiculata, commonly known as the tufted grass or coastal tufted grass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its adaptability to coastal conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing dune systems and preventing erosion."
