    "intro": "Centaurea paniculata subvar. eucastellana, commonly known as the Spanish thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
