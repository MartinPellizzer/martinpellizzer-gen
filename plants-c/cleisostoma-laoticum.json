    "intro": "Cleisostoma laoticum, commonly known as the Laotian hooded orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its unique hood-shaped petals and vibrant floral colors. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers, which bloom in summer, are often fragrant and attract various pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Cleisostoma laoticum is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
