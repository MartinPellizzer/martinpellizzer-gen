    "intro": "Coelogyne arthuriana, commonly known as the Arthur's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters of 3 to 5 on a branched inflorescence. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and leathery, providing structural support and efficient water retention. The orchid thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
