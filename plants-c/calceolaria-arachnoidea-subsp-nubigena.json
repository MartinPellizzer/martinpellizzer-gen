    "intro": "Calceolaria arachnoidea subsp. nubigena, commonly known as the cloud-dwelling slipper orchid, is a rare and delicate plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pale pink or white, with intricate patterns resembling lace. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to grow in rocky or alpine substrates. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
