    "intro": "Cucubalus procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate cucumber, is a flowering plant in the family Cucurbitaceae. It is a sprawling, herbaceous vine that typically grows close to the ground, with slender stems and hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in wet or disturbed habitats. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it can become invasive in some areas."
