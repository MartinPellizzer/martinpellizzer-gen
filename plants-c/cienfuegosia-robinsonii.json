It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and dense foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical regions. It produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered critically endangered."
