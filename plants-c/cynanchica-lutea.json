    "intro": "Cynanchica lutea, commonly known as the yellow milkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a distinguishing feature of the genus Asclepias. Cynanchica lutea is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, making it a resilient and adaptable species."
