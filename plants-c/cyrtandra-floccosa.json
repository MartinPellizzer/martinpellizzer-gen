    "intro": "Cyrtandra floccosa, commonly known as the fluffball mallow, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fluffy white bracts that resemble a cloud or a ball. The plant typically grows in wet forest habitats and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, but the showy bracts attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Cyrtandra floccosa is an important species in Hawaiian flora and is considered a keystone plant in certain ecosystems."
