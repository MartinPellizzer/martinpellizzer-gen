    "intro": "Cheilanthes tripinnata, commonly known as the three-fingered rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial plant characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes tripinnata is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in crevices, where it thrives in poor, well-drained soils."
