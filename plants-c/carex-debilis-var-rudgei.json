    "intro": "Carex debilis var. rudgei, commonly known as Rudge's sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It typically thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are generally light to medium green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, three-ranked flowers. It is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
