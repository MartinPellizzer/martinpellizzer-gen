    "intro": "Caladenia corynepetala, commonly known as the pink-tongued spider orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with a single, slender flower that has a distinctive pink or red tongue-like lip. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure. Caladenia corynepetala is a protected species, valued for its ecological and botanical significance."
