    "intro": "Chamaecrista pudibunda, commonly known as the pink burr legume, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling small bells. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces distinctive, spiny seed pods that enclose the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in some environments."
