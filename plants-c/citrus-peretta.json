    "intro": "Citrus peretta, commonly known as the dwarf lemon. It is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round citrus fruits that are typically yellow when ripe, though they may retain a greenish hue. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild, lemon-like flavor. Due to its compact size, it is often grown in containers or as a hedge in gardens."
