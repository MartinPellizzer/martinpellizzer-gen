    "intro": "Coelachyrum stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively through stolons, which root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered with fine hairs. Coelachyrum stoloniferum plays an important role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
