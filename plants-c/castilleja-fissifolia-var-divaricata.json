    "intro": "Castilleja fissifolia var. divaricata, commonly known as the splitleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It has a distinctive appearance with bright red or orange flowers that resemble paintbrushes, and its leaves are deeply lobed and often split. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It relies on other plants for some of its nutrients through its root system, which forms connections with the roots of neighboring vegetation. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
