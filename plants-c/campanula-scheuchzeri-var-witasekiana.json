    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri var. witasekiana, commonly known as the Witasek's bellflower, is a rare alpine plant native to the high mountain regions of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. It is considered a horticultural curiosity due to its unique appearance and limited distribution. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this endangered species from habitat loss and climate change."
