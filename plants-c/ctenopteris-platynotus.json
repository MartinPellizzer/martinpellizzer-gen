    "intro": "Ctenopteris platynotus, commonly known as the broad-leafed sea palm, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in coastal areas, often found in shallow marine environments or on rocky substrates. Its fronds are typically divided into numerous pinnae, which are arranged in a distinctive, feather-like pattern. Ctenopteris platynotus plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various marine organisms."
