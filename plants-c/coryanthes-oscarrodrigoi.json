    "intro": "Coryanthes oscarrodrigoi, commonly known as the Oscar Rodrigues torch orchid, is a rare and striking species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, torch-like inflorescence that bears vibrant, showy flowers. The plant produces large, colorful blooms with intricate patterns, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which are highly attractive to specific pollinators. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and specialized structures that aid in its reproductive strategy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
