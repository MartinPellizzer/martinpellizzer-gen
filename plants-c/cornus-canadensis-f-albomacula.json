This plant is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It belongs to the Cornaceae family and is characterized by its distinct white or pale spots on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its foliage and floral display make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
