    "intro": "Crepidium resupinatum, commonly known as the slant-lip orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and marshy areas. The plant has a slender, often reddish stem and produces small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive, recurved lips. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil. It is valued in horticulture for its unique floral structure and relatively easy care requirements."
