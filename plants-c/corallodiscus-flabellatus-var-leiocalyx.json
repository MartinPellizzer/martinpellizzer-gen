    "intro": "Corallodiscus flabellatus var. leiocalyx, commonly known as the broad-leafed sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent nature allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to coastal and arid conditions. The variety leiocalyx is distinguished by its broader leaf shape compared to other varieties of Corallodiscus flabellatus."
