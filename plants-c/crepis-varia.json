    "intro": "Crepis varia, commonly known as the variable hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features a robust stem with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, seed-filled heads. Crepis varia is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in a variety of environmental conditions. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pioneer species in ecological succession."
