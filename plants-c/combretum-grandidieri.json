It is a large, deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and broad, palmate leaves. The plant produces striking clusters of bright red or orange flowers during the dry season, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in dry forests and along riverbanks. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
