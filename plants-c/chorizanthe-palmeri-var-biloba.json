    "intro": "Chorizanthe palmeri var. biloba, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family, characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils and extreme temperatures. This variety is distinguished by its bilobed leaves, which contribute to its unique botanical appearance."
