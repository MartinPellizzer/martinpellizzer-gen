It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and aromatic. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to semi-arid and dry tropical environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in timber production."
