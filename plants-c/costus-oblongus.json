    "intro": "Costus oblongus, commonly known as the broadleaf costus, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features upright, branching stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by colorful bracts, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Costus oblongus is often cultivated for its striking floral display and is well-suited to warm, humid climates."
