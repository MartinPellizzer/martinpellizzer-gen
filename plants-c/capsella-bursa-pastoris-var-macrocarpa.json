    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris var. macrocarpa, commonly known as greater shepherd's purse, is a variant of the common garden weed shepherd's purse. It is a low-growing annual plant with distinctive triangular seed pods that are larger than those of the typical variety. The plant typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and has alternate, heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in loose racemes, contributing to its ornamental appeal in some contexts."
