    "intro": "Calamagrostis arundinacea subsp. adpressiramea, commonly known as narrowleaf reed, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, slender culms that often grow in dense clumps. The plant typically thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets that are often adorned with silky, feathery hairs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
