    "intro": "Climacoptera longipistillata, commonly known as the long-stalked mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to host plants. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where it relies on specific host trees for nutrients and support."
