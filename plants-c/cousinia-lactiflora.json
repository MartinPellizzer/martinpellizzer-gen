    "intro": "Cousinia lactiflora, commonly known as the milkflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, yellow to cream-colored flowers. The plant has silvery-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures. Cousinia lactiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
