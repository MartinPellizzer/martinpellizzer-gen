    "intro": "Cryptogramma crispa f. americana, commonly known as the American cryptogramma, is a fern native to the eastern United States. It is a small, mat-forming plant with delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in lines along the veins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
