    "intro": "Cnidoscolus, commonly known as the \"barbados spinach\" or \"gumbo\", is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves and are native to tropical regions of the Americas. Many species within the genus are cultivated for their edible leaves, which are rich in nutrients and have a mild, slightly bitter taste. The plant's structure includes a thick, fleshy stem and often has milky sap, a common trait in the Euphorbiaceae family. Some species are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
