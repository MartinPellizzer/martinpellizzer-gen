It is a natural hybrid between Carduus benedictus and Carduus crispus, resulting in a plant with distinctive composite flowers and spiny leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to southern Europe. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a composite head. This species is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
