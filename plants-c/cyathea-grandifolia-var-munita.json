It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots and a crown of large, pinnate fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and can grow up to several meters in length, giving the plant a dramatic appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
