It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
