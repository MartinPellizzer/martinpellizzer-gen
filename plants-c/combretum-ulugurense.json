    "intro": "Combretum ulugurense, commonly known as the Uluguru combretum, is a shrub or small tree native to the Uluguru Mountains in Tanzania. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
