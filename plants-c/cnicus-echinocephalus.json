    "intro": "Cnicus echinocephalus, commonly known as the thistle-like sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring and summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils. Cnicus echinocephalus is often found in disturbed habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
