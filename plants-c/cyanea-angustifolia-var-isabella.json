    "intro": "Cyanea angustifolia var. isabella, commonly known as the Isabella's narrowleaf Cyanea, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is often found in coastal areas. It is a perennial shrub that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with a woody stem and hairy foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
