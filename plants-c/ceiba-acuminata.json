    "intro": "Ceiba acuminata, commonly known as the ceiba tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Malvaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, including countries like Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil. The tree is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and massive buttressed roots, which help it thrive in humid, lowland environments. Its large, palmately lobed leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and its flowers are pollinated by insects. The ceiba tree also plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
