It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, milky sap and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often inconspicuous, while the fruit is a capsule that releases seeds when mature. The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution in handling."
