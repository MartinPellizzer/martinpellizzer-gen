    "intro": "Cossonia africana subvar. leiocarpa, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a tall, evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, dark green, leathery leaves and produces small, fragrant yellow flowers clustered in terminal spikes. The plant is known for its hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. The subvariety leiocarpa is distinguished by its smooth, less hairy leaves compared to other varieties of Cossonia."
