    "intro": "Cyperus eggersii var. laticeps, commonly known as the broad-headed flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, and is often found in disturbed soils. Its adaptability to moist conditions makes it a common species in both natural and cultivated landscapes."
