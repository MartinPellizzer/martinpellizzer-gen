    "intro": "Chamaeraphis squarrosa var. depauperata, commonly known as the sparse sea rocket, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, often reddish leaves that help reduce water loss in arid or coastal conditions. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it is often found in salt marshes and sandy shores. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. This variant is less robust than the typical form, showing a more delicate growth habit."
