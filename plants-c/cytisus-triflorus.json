It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or pea family, characterized by its typical pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a woody stem with thorny branches. Cytisus triflorus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
