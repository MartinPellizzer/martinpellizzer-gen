    "intro": "Ceratozamia fuscoviridis, commonly known as the dark green cycad, is a species of cycad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically a dark green color and can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. This plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones rather than flowers. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water."
