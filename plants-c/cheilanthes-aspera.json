    "intro": "Cheilanthes aspera, commonly known as the rock hibiscus or desert shield fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its robust, wiry rhizomes and compact, evergreen fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with its thick, waxy leaves reducing water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind or insects. Cheilanthes aspera is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
