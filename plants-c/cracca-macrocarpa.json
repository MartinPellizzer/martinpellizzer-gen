It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a distinctive, elongated schizocarp that splits into two parts when mature. Cracca macrocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
