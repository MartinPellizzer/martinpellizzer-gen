    "intro": "Codonium arborescens var. berterianum, commonly known as the Berterian codonium, is a rare and distinctive plant species characterized by its unique branching structure and specialized leaf morphology. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes aromatic herbs and some toxic plants, and is native to specific regions in southern Africa. The plant features compound leaves with finely divided segments and produces small, umbel-like clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and displaying a slow growth rate. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
