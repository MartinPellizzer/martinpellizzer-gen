It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. The plant is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals around the stems. Its small, pale yellow flowers are followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain several seeds. Casuarina distyla is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments with salt spray and strong winds."
