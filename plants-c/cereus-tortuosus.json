    "intro": "Cereus tortuosus, commonly known as the zigzag cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that grow in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cereus tortuosus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and striking floral displays."
