    "intro": "Centaurea solstitialis subsp. erythracantha, commonly known as the redstem globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and bright red to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has small, narrow leaves and produces seeds in fluffy, globular clusters. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
