    "intro": "Cornella canadensis, commonly known as Canadian cornel, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Cornaceae, which includes willows and other related plants. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring simple, alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its small, white to pinkish flowers appear in clusters during late spring to early summer, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. The bark of Cornella canadensis is thick and flaky, often peeling in strips, and is characteristic of its mature growth stage."
