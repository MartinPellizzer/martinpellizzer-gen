    "intro": "Coristospermum, commonly known as the \"false sandmat,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. They are characterized by their small, often yellow or white flowers and their ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The seeds of Coristospermum are enclosed in hard pods and are often dispersed by wind or animals. Some species are used in traditional medicine, while others are considered invasive in certain regions."
