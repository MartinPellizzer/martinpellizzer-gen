    "intro": "Ctenopteris apiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea palm, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in marine environments. The plant has a rhizome that grows along the seafloor, supporting the fronds that extend upward. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a leathery texture, adapted to withstand coastal conditions. Ctenopteris apiculata plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
