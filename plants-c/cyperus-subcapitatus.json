    "intro": "Cyperus subcapitatus, commonly known as the spike rush, is a flowering plant in the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense stands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often surrounded by bracts. Its rhizomes help it spread and establish in various aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Cyperus subcapitatus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
