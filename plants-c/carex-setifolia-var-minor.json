    "intro": "Carex setifolia var. minor, commonly known as slender thread sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically light green to blue-green in color, with a distinctive thread-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
