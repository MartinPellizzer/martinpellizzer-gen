    "intro": "Canistrum schwackeanum, commonly known as the Schwaack's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces berries that are an important food source for various bird species. It is native to Central and South America and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
