    "intro": "Canthium cochinchinense, commonly known as the Vietnamese spurge or wild hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with rough, hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds, and it thrives in moist, tropical environments. Canthium cochinchinense is often found in forest understories and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
