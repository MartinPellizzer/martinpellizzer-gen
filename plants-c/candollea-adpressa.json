It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. This plant is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with clusters of small, spiny stems. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in summer, and are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. Candollea adpressa is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
