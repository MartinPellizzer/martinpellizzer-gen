    "intro": "Calamagrostis capillaris, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with fine, silky hairs covering the leaves and inflorescences. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically green to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a soft, hairy texture that distinguishes it from other grasses. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along streambanks."
