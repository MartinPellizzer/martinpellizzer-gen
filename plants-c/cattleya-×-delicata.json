    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 delicata, commonly known as the fragrant cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its vibrant, fragrant blooms. It originates from the interbreeding of Cattleya labiata and Cattleya mossiae, resulting in a plant with striking, often ruffled petals. The flowers typically display a mix of white, pink, and purple hues, with a distinctive, sweet scent that attracts pollinators. This orchid thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its popularity in horticulture is due to its ease of cultivation and long-lasting, showy flowers."
