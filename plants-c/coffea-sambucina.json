    "intro": "Coffea sambucina, commonly known as the Italian coffee bean or the sweet coffee plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in mild, temperate climates. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by red berries containing the seeds used for coffee. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a glossy surface and a mild, aromatic scent. Although it is related to other coffee species, it is not widely cultivated for commercial coffee production."
