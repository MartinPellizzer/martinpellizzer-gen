    "intro": "Celtis occidentalis var. aspera, commonly known as the roughleaf hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, elliptical leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by smooth, spherical fruits that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. It is often found in riparian zones, woodlands, and along roadsides, thriving in a variety of soil types. The roughleaf hackberry is valued for its adaptability and provides food for birds and small mammals."
