    "intro": "Cynanchum kunthii, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and has opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and are usually pink to purple in color, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cynanchum kunthii is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in some indigenous cultures."
