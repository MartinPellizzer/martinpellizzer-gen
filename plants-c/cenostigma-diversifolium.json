It is characterized by its diverse leaf shapes, which vary in size and texture depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are often arranged alternately along the stems, and the plant has a woody structure. Cenostigma diversifolium is adapted to grow in dry, rocky habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
