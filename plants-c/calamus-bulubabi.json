    "intro": "Calamus bulubabi, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, triangular stems that often have a zigzag appearance due to the arrangement of its nodes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense clusters at the base of the plant. Calamus bulubabi is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
