It features small, aromatic leaves with a mint-like fragrance, which are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces tiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Clinopodium alpinum subsp. alpinum is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
