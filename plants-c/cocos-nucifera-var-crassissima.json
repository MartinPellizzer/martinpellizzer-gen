    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. crassissima, commonly known as the thick-shelled coconut, is a variant of the coconut palm characterized by its robust, thick husk that encases the nut. This variety is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The thick husk provides better protection for the coconut's inner layers, which contain the nutritious coconut water and flesh. It is often cultivated for its high-quality coconuts used in culinary and commercial applications. The plant's morphology includes tall, slender trunks and large, feather-like leaves, typical of the palm family."
