    "intro": "Cyrtantherella macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a distinctive lip that is often larger than the other petals. The plant grows in rocky or open habitats, often in areas with well-drained soil. Its flowers bloom during the dry season, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
