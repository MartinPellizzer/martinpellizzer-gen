    "intro": "Crepis neomexicana, commonly known as the New Mexico hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss."
