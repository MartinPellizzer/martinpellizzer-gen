    "intro": "Cleidion brevipetiolatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed sycamore, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates as a landscape tree."
