    "intro": "Cynosurus cristatus var. foliosus, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and along coastal areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy or disturbed soils."
