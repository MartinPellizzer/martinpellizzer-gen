    "intro": "Cousinia dissecta var. microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf alpine cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, hairy leaves that are often dissected into fine lobes. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
