It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its robust, woody stems and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in its native environment.
