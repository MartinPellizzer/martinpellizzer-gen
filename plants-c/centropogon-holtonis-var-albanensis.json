It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils at elevations between 1,200 and 2,000 meters. It is a perennial herb with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
