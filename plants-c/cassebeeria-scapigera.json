It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers. The plant produces elongated, narrow pods that contain flat, winged seeds, which aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Cassebeeria scapigera is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
