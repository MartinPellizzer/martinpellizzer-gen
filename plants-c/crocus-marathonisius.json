    "intro": "Crocus marathonisius, commonly known as the Marathon crocus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its early blooming period, typically in late winter or early spring, and features striking violet-blue petals. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive, rounded shape and a central, club-like structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded locations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
