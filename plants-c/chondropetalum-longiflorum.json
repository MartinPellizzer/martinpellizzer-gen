    "intro": "Chondropetalum longiflorum, commonly known as the long-flowered clubmoss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant characterized by its creeping rhizomes and dense clusters of needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the foliage. Native to New Zealand, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its unique structure and reproductive features make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
