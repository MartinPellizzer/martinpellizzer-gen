    "intro": "Cupania nitida, commonly known as the velvetleaf or smooth cupania, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many plants with latex-producing properties. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually smooth and have a glossy appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in catkin-like inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Cupania nitida is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
