    "intro": "Calocarpum sclerocarpum, commonly known as the hard-seeded calocarpum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rhamnaceae. It is characterized by its small, woody fruits that remain on the plant for an extended period, a feature that contributes to its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is native to regions of southern Africa. Its leaves are alternate and often have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique fruit structure and ecological adaptations."
