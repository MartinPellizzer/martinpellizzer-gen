    "intro": "Cereus viridiflorus, commonly known as the greenflower cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, a feature common among many cacti adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is minimal, with the stems serving as the primary photosynthetic structure. Cereus viridiflorus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions."
