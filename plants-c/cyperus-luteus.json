It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and cylindrical, spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. Its yellowish flowers are small and clustered, contributing to its ornamental value in aquatic gardens. Cyperus luteus is also used in traditional medicine and as a water purifier in some cultures."
