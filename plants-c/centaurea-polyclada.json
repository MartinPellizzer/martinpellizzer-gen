    "intro": "Centaurea polyclada, commonly known as the common centaury, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is an annual or biennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its seeds are small and have a hard coat, allowing them to remain viable in the soil for several years. Centaurea polyclada is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural fields."
