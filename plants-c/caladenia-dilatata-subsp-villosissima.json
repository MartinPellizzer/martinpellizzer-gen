    "intro": "Caladenia dilatata subsp. villosissima, commonly known as the Woolly Spider-orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its long, slender, hairy stems and its distinctive, spider-like flowers that are typically pale yellow to cream in color. The plant produces a single, narrow, lance-shaped leaf and has a short, underground tuber that helps it survive in its arid environment. It is adapted to grow in sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as shrublands and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
