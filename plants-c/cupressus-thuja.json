    "intro": "Cupressus thuja, commonly known as the Western red cedar, is a coniferous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves, which are typically reddish-brown in color and arranged in crossed pairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is reddish-gray and becomes fissured with age, adding to its ornamental value. The tree is often used in landscaping due to its attractive appearance and resistance to decay."
