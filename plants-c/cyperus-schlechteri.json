It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. Its slender, triangular stems are covered in fine, scale-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered flower heads.
