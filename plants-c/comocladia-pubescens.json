    "intro": "Comocladia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy sea bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or muddy soils. Its seeds are encased in a hard, leathery pod, which helps in dispersal by water. Comocladia pubescens plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for small marine organisms."
