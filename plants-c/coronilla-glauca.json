    "intro": "Coronilla glauca, commonly known as blue crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system. Coronilla glauca is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, enriching the soil."
