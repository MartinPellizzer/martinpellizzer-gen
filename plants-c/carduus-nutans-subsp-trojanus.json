It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring a robust stem covered in coarse, prickly hairs. The plant produces large, purple to violet composite flowers that bloom in late summer, surrounded by a dense layer of bracts. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with serrated edges and a hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The species is characterized by its robust growth habit and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
