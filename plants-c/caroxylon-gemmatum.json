    "intro": "Caroxylon gemmatum, commonly known as the gemmatum cactus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cactaceae. It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in countries like Argentina and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing at the ends of the stems during the warmer months. Caroxylon gemmatum is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
