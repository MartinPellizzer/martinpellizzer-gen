    "intro": "Chamaesyce celastroides var. amplectens, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to parts of North America. It features succulent, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as farina. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
