    "intro": "Cactus placentiformis, commonly known as the placental cactus, is a unique species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, disc-like stems that resemble a placenta, hence its common name. The plant features spines and is adapted to arid environments, making it highly drought-resistant. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming during the warmer months. Despite its unusual appearance, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing shelter and food for certain wildlife."
