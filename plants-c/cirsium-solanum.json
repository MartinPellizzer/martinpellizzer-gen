    "intro": "Cirsium solanum, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Its leaves are covered in stiff, prickly hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
