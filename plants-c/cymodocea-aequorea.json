It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is typically found in shallow coastal waters. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are adapted to withstand strong wave action and salinity. It plays an important role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for marine life. Cymodocea aequorea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in intertidal zones."
