It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers. Native to North America, this plant thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
