    "intro": "Crataegus pyracantha var. pauciflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. The plant typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and dry soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It is noted for its ornamental value, with showy white or pink flowers in spring followed by vibrant red fruits in autumn. This variety is less floriferous than other hawthorn species, hence its name \"pauciflora,\" meaning \"few-flowered.\""
