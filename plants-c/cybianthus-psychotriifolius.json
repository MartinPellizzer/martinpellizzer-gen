    "intro": "Cybianthus psychotriifolius, commonly known as the psychotriifolius flameflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its unique, vibrant orange-red flowers. The plant features palmate leaves with three to five lobes, giving it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
