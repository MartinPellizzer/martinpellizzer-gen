    "intro": "Capurodendron androyense, commonly known as the Androyense tree, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the arid regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashew and sumac, and is characterized by its woody structure and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish flowers that are followed by small, fleshy fruits, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Capurodendron androyense is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
