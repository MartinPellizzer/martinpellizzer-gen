    "intro": "Casearia arborea subsp. arborea, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils, making it a common species in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various birds and mammals. This subspecies plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial wildlife."
