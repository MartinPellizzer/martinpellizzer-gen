    "intro": "Cyrtochilum macranthum, commonly known as the large-flowered cyclotella, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a compact rosette, and it produces numerous small, clustered flowers on erect inflorescences. Cyrtochilum macranthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings due to its specific environmental requirements."
