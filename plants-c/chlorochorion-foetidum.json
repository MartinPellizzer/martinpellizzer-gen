    "intro": "Chlorochorion foetidum, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, often pungent odor, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions. Its leaves are usually compound, with a serrated edge, and it produces small, greenish flowers in umbels. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp, which splits into two one-seeded parts when mature."
