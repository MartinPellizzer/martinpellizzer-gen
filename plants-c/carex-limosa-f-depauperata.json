    "intro": "Carex limosa f. depauperata, commonly known as the slender sedges, is a variant of the common sedge, characterized by its reduced foliage and slender, grass-like leaves. It is a perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas, often found in temperate regions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its compact form makes it suitable for small garden spaces or as a ground cover in water features."
