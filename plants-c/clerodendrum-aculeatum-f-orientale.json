    "intro": "Clerodendrum aculeatum f. orientale, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a striking ornamental shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that range in color from red to orange, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its foliage is typically dark green and glossy, adding a lush contrast to its showy inflorescences."
