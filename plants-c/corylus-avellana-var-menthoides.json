    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. menthoides, commonly known as the Mentha-leaved hazel, is a variant of the common hazel that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its finely divided, almost fern-like leaves that resemble those of the mint plant, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by edible nuts that mature in the fall. It is typically found in temperate regions, often growing in woodland edges or moist soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
