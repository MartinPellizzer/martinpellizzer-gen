It features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple or red at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue or purple flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is often found in riparian zones. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
