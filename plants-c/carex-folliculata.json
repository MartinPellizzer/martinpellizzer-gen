    "intro": "Carex folliculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Carex folliculata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife habitats."
