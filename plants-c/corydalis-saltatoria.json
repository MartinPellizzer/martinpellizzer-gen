    "intro": "Corydalis saltatoria, commonly known as the running corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant has a creeping growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or open ground. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are typically borne in clusters at the tips of the stems. Corydalis saltatoria is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms and easy maintenance."
