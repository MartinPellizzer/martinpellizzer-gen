    "intro": "Calocapnos nobilis, commonly known as the noble calocarp, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops and ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Calocapnos nobilis is considered a vulnerable species."
