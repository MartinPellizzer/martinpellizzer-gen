    "intro": "Colchicum pulchellum, commonly known as the showy autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It produces striking violet to purple flowers in late summer to early autumn, which emerge from a bulb-like corm. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually present during the growing season. Its flowers are typically borne on tall, slender stems and are surrounded by three leaf-like bracts. Colchicum pulchellum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its dramatic blooms."
