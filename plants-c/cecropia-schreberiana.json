    "intro": "Cecropia schreberiana, commonly known as the giant cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and long, slender stems that often form a dense canopy. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with ants, which reside in the hollow stems and protect the tree from herbivores. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important component of secondary forests and useful for reforestation projects. The tree also produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody fruits containing seeds."
