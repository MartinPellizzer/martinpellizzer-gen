    "intro": "Cardamomum foetens, commonly known as the wild cardamom or black cardamom, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or greenish flowers that are followed by dark, aromatic pods containing the spice used in cooking. The seeds inside the pods are the primary part used for flavoring, known for their strong, pungent aroma. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often cultivated for its medicinal and culinary value."
