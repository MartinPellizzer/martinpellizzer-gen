    "intro": "Coleus xerophilus, commonly known as the desert coleus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with limited water resources."
