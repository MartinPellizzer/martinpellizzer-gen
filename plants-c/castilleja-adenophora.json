    "intro": "Castilleja adenophora, commonly known as the glandular castilleja, is a species of flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant is characterized by its bright red to orange flowers, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon, where it grows in dry, open habitats. Castilleja adenophora plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host for various insects and fungi."
