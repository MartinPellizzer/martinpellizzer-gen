    "intro": "Cardamine neglecta, commonly known as the lesser watercress, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along streams, in woodland areas, and in wet meadows. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a delicate, fern-like appearance, and small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous, and it spreads through rhizomes, allowing it to colonize new areas. Cardamine neglecta is often found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in cool, damp conditions."
