    "intro": "Caladenia sigmoidea, commonly known as the narrow-leafed spider-orchid, is a striking orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features a single, narrow leaf and produces a spike of up to 15 pale yellow to greenish flowers with a distinctive spider-like appearance. Its flowers are pollinated by thynnid wasps, which are attracted by the orchid's scent and coloration. Caladenia sigmoidea is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific environmental conditions for successful growth and reproduction."
