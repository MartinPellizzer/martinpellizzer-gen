    "intro": "Clematis occidentalis, commonly known as the western clematis, is a deciduous vine native to western North America. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its climbing habit allows it to grow along trellises or structures, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade. Clematis occidentalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
