    "intro": "Chlorospatha jaramilloi, commonly known as the Jaramillo's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its pale greenish-white petals and a unique, almost translucent appearance that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that bloom during the wet season, typically between April and June. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to survive. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered critically endangered and is rarely seen in the wild."
