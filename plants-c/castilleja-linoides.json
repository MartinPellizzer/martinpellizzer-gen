    "intro": "Castilleja linoides, commonly known as the desert paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to parasitize the roots of nearby host plants, drawing nutrients and water from them. Its structure consists of a slender stem with dense clusters of showy flowers at the top, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Castilleja linoides plays an important ecological role in its arid habitat by contributing to pollinator activity and supporting local biodiversity."
