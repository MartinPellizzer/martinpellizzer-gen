    "intro": "Cerastium alpinum var. vestitum, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to withstand cold and harsh mountain climates. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and silvery foliage make it a distinctive and ornamental species in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
