    "intro": "Cuscuta americana var. spectabilis, commonly known as the American dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive appearance with its thread-like, yellow stems that twine around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and can be found growing on a variety of herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread widely. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant populations."
