    "intro": "Cyclosorus decorus, commonly known as the ornate water shield, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves, which are typically broad and rounded with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged or nearly so, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Cyclosorus decorus is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life. Its botanical features make it an important species for studies in freshwater botany and ecological research."
