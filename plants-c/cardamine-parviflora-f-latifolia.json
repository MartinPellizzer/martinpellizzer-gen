    "intro": "Cardamine parviflora f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved watercress, is a variant of the watercress species native to moist, shaded environments. It features elongated, broad, and slightly succulent leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in terminal umbels. Its stems are usually short and often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. This form is notable for its larger foliage compared to the typical species, making it a distinctive feature in wetland ecosystems."
