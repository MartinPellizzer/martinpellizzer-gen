    "intro": "Colocasia aegyptiaca, commonly known as Egyptian arrowhead, is a tropical perennial herb native to Africa, southern Asia, and Australia. It features large, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking purple or white spadices, which are the flowering structures that resemble a spike. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Colocasia aegyptiaca is also known for its ability to tolerate waterlogged soil, making it suitable for wetland gardens."
