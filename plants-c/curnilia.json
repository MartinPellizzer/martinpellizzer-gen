    "intro": "Curnilia, commonly known as the mountain geranium, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Geraniaceae. It comprises several species that are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe and Asia. These plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their upright growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers. The leaves are often palmately lobed, and the flowers can range in color from pink to purple, depending on the species. Curnilia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens for their hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
