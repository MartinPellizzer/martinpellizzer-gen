    "intro": "Cipadessa borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean cipadessa, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
