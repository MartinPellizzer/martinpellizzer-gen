    "intro": "Cerastium robustum, commonly known as the hairy chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers with five petals and hairy stems that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Cerastium robustum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to spread easily through stolons."
