    "intro": "Castilleja anthemidifolia, commonly known as the yellow Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, brush-like inflorescences. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in its native ecosystems."
