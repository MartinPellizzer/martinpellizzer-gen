    "intro": "Coscinium fenestratum, commonly known as the window leaf or African moonseed, is a climbing shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, fenestrated (window-like) leaves that are often perforated or lobed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
