    "intro": "Clematis vitalba var. mollissima, commonly known as the velvet clematis, is a climbing vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets that are soft to the touch. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is often found in woodland areas and thrives in partial shade to full sun conditions."
