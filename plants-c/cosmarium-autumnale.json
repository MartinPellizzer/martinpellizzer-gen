    "intro": "Cosmarium autumnale, commonly known as the autumn waterflea, is a freshwater green alga that thrives in temperate regions during the fall season. It is characterized by its small, spherical cells that often form colonies, and it typically inhabits still or slow-moving water bodies. The plant exhibits a unique life cycle that includes both motile and non-motile stages, with the latter forming resting spores to survive harsh environmental conditions. Cosmarium autumnale plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as a food source for microorganisms and small aquatic animals. Its presence is often an indicator of water quality and seasonal changes in aquatic environments."
