    "intro": "Chloris parva, commonly known as small grass or dwarf grass, is a small, tufted perennial grass native to Australia. It typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often forming dense mats that stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny flowers. It is well adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a hardy species in harsh conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal vegetation and a subject of ecological study."
