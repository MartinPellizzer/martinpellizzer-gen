    "intro": "Corydalis caucasica subsp. abantensis, commonly known as the Caucasian Corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds enclosed in a capsule, which is a typical feature of the genus Corydalis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and unique floral structure, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
