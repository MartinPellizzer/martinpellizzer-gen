    "intro": "Crotalaria pudica, commonly known as the shy plant or the blushing morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, papery leaves and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including gardens and roadside areas. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, a behavior that gives it its common name. Crotalaria pudica is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
