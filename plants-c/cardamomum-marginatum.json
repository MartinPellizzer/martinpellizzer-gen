    "intro": "Cardamomum marginatum, commonly known as the marginated cardamom, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves with white margins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by dark brown, three-lobed berries. Cardamomum marginatum is cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties. Its growth habit is typically upright, with a dense foliage that makes it suitable for shade gardens or as a border plant."
