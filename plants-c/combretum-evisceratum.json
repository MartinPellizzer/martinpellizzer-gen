    "intro": "Combretum evisceratum, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is a species of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
