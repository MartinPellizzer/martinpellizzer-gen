It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is a popular choice for experienced cactus growers."
