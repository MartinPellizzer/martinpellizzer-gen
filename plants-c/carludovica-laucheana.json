    "intro": "Carludovica laucheana, commonly known as the Laucheana cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a small, spiny cactus that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white spines. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Carludovica laucheana is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its stem and reducing transpiration through its spiny covering."
