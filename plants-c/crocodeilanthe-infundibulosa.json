    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe infundibulosa, commonly known as the crested fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, crested fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are pinnately divided with a unique, wavy appearance, and it produces small, clustered spore sacs. Crocodeilanthe infundibulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
