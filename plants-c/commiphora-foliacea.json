    "intro": "Commiphora foliacea, commonly known as the leafy myrrh tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its simple, elliptic to ovate leaves that are often densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its aromatic resin, similar to myrrh, has been used traditionally in incense and medicine. Commiphora foliacea thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade."
