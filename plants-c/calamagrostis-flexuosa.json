    "intro": "Calamagrostis flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its graceful, arching stems that often form a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces fluffy, silver-green plumes in the fall, which add ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Calamagrostis flexuosa is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
