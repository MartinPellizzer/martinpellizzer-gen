    "intro": "Clusia spruceana, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, dark green leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often used as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Clusia spruceana is also valued for its ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions and partial shade."
