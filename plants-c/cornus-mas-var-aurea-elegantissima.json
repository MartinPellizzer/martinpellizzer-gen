    "intro": "Cornus mas var. aurea-elegantissima, commonly known as the golden hornbeam, is a variant of the common hornbeam. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow leaves that provide vibrant autumn color. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree with smooth, gray bark that develops fissures with age. It produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and landscapes due to its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
