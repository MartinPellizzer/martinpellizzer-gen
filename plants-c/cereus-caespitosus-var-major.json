    "intro": "Cereus caespitosus var. major, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that grow in a bushy, shrub-like form. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. These flowers emit a sweet fragrance and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight."
