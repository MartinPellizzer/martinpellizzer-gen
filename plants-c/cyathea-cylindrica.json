    "intro": "Cyathea cylindrica, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique structure with a central trunk covered in a layer of old fronds, which gives it a distinctive appearance. Cyathea cylindrica thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable component of New Zealand's native flora."
