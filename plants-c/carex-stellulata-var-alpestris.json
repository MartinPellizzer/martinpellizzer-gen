    "intro": "Carex stellulata var. alpestris, commonly known as alpine star sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to alpine regions of North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive star-shaped inflorescence. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in open meadows and slopes, contributing to the ecological diversity of alpine habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
