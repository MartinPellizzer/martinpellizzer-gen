    "intro": "Cardamine quinquefolia var. alternifolia, commonly known as the alternateleaf watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features a basal rosette of finely divided, alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stems. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery taste similar to watercress, making it a valued plant in some culinary traditions. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in wet soils and its role in supporting local insect populations."
