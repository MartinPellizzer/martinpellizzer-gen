    "intro": "Cotoneaster borealichinensis, commonly known as the northern cotoneaster, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of northern China. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces small, red berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and has a preference for cooler, temperate climates. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a smooth margin, and it flowers in the spring with clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. Cotoneaster borealichinensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in shaded environments."
