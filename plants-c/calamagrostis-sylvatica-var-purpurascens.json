    "intro": "Calamagrostis sylvatica var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive purplish tinge in the foliage, particularly in the inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in woodland or heathland environments. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing panicle-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting a range of invertebrates and birds."
