    "intro": "Cercocarpus hypoleucus, commonly known as the silverleaf curlleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves and small, red berries that are produced in late summer. The plant has a compact, multi-stemmed growth habit and is often found in dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are typically curled and have a distinctive silvery appearance due to their fine, white pubescence. Cercocarpus hypoleucus is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
