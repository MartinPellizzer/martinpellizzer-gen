    "intro": "Carex riparia var. subgracilescens, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh sedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and three-ranked leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, three-ranked flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more compact growth habit compared to other Carex species."
