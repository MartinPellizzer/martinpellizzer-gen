    "intro": "Cicerbita decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive cicerbit, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are erect and hairy. Cicerbita decipiens is often mistaken for other similar species due to its deceptive appearance, which has led to its common name."
