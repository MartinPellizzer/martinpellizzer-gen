    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. coelata, commonly known as the silver filbert or white filbert, is a variant of the hazelnut tree characterized by its striking white to silver foliage. This ornamental variety is native to Europe and is cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than its nuts. The leaves are broadly ovate with a serrated margin and turn a vibrant yellow in the autumn. It produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a prickly husk, similar to other hazelnut species. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in garden landscapes for its unique foliage color."
