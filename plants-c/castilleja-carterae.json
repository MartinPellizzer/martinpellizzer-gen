    "intro": "Castilleja carterae, commonly known as Carter's milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reddish-orange flowers and lack of leaves. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
