    "intro": "Cyperus subsquarrosus, commonly known as the spiny flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish or pale yellow flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Cyperus subsquarrosus thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, and is often found in disturbed soils. Its growth habit and morphology make it an important species in ecological studies of wetland ecosystems."
