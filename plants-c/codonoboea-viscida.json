    "intro": "Codonoboea viscida, commonly known as the sticky codonopsis, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by follicle fruits containing elongated seeds. Its sticky secretions on the stems and leaves help in adhering to supports and deterring herbivores. Codonoboea viscida is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories."
