    "intro": "Cyperus digitatus subsp. auricomus, commonly known as the golden flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, often forming dense vegetation. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common species in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its golden-colored inflorescences, which give it its common name."
