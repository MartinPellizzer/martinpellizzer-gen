    "intro": "Carex nudata var. anomala, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and slightly curved, with a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, three-stamen flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variant is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
