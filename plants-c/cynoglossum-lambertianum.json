It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, pale blue to violet flowers arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in partial shade to full sun. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological biodiversity. The plant is also known for its medicinal properties, historically used in traditional remedies."
