It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to cold, moist environments. It has strap-like leaves and produces a tall, slender stem that supports its floral display. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
