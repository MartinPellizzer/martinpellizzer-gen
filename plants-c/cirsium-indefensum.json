    "intro": "Cirsium indefensum, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, rough leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides. Its leaves are covered in stiff, prickly hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Cirsium indefensum is often used in traditional medicine and has a long history of cultivation in gardens."
