It is characterized by its showy, fiery orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. Its bark is smooth and greyish, often exfoliating to reveal a lighter inner layer. Crossyne is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can grow up to 20 meters tall."
