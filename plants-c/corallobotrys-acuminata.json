    "intro": "Corallobotrys acuminata, commonly known as the slender coralroot, is an epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically short-lived. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, enabling it to absorb nutrients from the forest floor. Due to its specialized growth requirements, it is often found in shaded, moist environments within mature hardwood forests."
