    "intro": "Cereus parvisetus, commonly known as the small-stemmed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces night-blooming flowers that are typically pale yellow or pink, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It is a drought-tolerant plant, adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and flowering habits, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
