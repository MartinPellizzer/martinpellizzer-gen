    "intro": "Cerastium durmitoreum, commonly known as the sleeping grass, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically forms a mat-like growth pattern, with hairy, succulent stems and oval-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its common name reflects the way its leaves appear to \"sleep\" or droop when disturbed."
