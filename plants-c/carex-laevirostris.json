    "intro": "Carex laevirostris, commonly known as narrow-beak sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered flower heads that are usually greenish or brownish in color. Carex laevirostris is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
