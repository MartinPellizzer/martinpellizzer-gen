It is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant exhibits a climbing habit, with slender stems that can twine around supporting structures. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
