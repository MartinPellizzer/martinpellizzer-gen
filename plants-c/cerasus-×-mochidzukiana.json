    "intro": "Cerasus \u00d7 mochidzukiana, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or yaezakura, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Prunus lannesiana and Prunus speciosa. It is characterized by its ornamental value, particularly its showy pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows as a deciduous shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth surface and a pointed tip, and they turn yellow in the fall. Cerasus \u00d7 mochidzukiana is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and is also used in traditional Japanese culture for its symbolic significance."
