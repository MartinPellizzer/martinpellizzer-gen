    "intro": "Clidemia ostrina, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Hawaiian velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is typically found in moist, shaded environments. Clidemia ostrina is often considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its botanical features make it a notable plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
