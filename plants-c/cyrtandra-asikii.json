It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and stream banks. Cyrtandra asikii is notable for its small, elliptical leaves and its role in the unique flora of the Hawaiian archipelago. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
