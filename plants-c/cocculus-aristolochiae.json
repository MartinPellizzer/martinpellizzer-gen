    "intro": "Cocculus aristolochiae, commonly known as the Indian snakeroot, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, hooded flowers that resemble a snake's head. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its roots have been used in traditional medicine for various purposes, though they contain harmful compounds. Due to its toxic nature, it is often avoided in modern herbal practices."
