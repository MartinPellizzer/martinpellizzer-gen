    "intro": "Cirsium maackii, commonly known as Maack's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features a rosette of spiny, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear purple to pinkish flowers in late summer. Its leaves and stems are covered with stiff, prickly hairs that serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Cirsium maackii is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain regions."
