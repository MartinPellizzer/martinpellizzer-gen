    "intro": "Crossonephelis thorelii, commonly known as the Caribbean flame tree, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces clusters of bright red, flame-like flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution in tropical regions."
