    "intro": "Chamaecytisus drepanolobus, commonly known as the dwarf broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, arching stems covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often with a reddish or purplish hue on the underside. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
