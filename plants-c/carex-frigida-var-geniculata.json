    "intro": "Carex frigida var. geniculata, commonly known as the Arctic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It has grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and are arranged in dense, compact clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are usually wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and subarctic habitats. Due to its cold-hardy nature, it is a key component of the vegetation in high-latitude ecosystems."
