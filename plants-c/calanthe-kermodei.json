    "intro": "Calanthe kermodei, commonly known as the Kermode's calanthe, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its strikingly patterned leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clusters over time. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
