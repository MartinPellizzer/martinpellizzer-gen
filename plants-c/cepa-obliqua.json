It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces small, bulbous structures called corms, which are used for propagation and storage. Its botanical features make it suitable for cultivation in moist, well-drained soils. Cepa obliqua is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
