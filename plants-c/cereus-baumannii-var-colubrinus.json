    "intro": "Cereus baumannii var. colubrinus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to produce large, showy flowers that open at night. The plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they emit a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant is relatively drought-tolerant and requires minimal care once established."
