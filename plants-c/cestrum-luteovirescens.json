    "intro": "Cestrum luteovirescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered cestrum, is a deciduous shrub native to Central and South America. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers give way to small, round, orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
