    "intro": "Calligonum eriopodum subsp. turkmenorum, commonly known as Turkmenian sandmat, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with densely hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy and saline soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
