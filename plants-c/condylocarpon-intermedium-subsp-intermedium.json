    "intro": "Condylocarpon intermedium subsp. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate condylocarpon, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Trapeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is usually greenish to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a cyanobacterial partner, which contributes to its ability to photosynthesize. It typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. This subspecies is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats across the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico."
