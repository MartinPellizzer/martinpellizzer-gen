    "intro": "Citronella apogon, commonly known as the narrowleaf citronella, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic and can emit a strong lemony scent. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically clustered at the base of the leaves. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in moist, sunny environments. Citronella apogon is often cultivated for its potential insect-repelling properties due to the presence of citronellol in its essential oils."
