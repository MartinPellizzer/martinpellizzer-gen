    "intro": "Cotoneaster tjuliniae, commonly known as the Tjulin's cotoneaster, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of central Asia, particularly in the Tian Shan and Pamir Mountains. The plant is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and produces clusters of small, red berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Cotoneaster tjuliniae is typically found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some botanical gardens, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
