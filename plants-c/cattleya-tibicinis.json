    "intro": "Cattleya tibicinis, commonly known as the golden cattleya, is a striking orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Cattleya tibicinis is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant blooms and adaptability to cultivation."
