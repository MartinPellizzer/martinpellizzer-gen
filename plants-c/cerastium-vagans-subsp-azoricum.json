    "intro": "Cerastium vagans subsp. azoricum, commonly known as the Azorean mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Azores. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically hairy and oval in shape, adapted to the moist, cool conditions of its mountainous habitat. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are arranged in umbels and attract various pollinators. It thrives in shaded, rocky or forested areas and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
