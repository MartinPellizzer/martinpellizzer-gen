It is characterized by its striking purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that emerge from a bulbous underground stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and studied for its bioactive compounds."
