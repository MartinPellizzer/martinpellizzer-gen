    "intro": "Carcia, commonly known as the desert rose, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features fleshy, water-storing leaves that help it survive in dry environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often with a velvety texture. Its root system is shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains. Carcia is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal in landscaping."
