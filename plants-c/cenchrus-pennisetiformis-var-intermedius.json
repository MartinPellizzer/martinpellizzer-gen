    "intro": "Cenchrus pennisetiformis var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate beardgrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed areas. Its adaptability makes it a common weed in agricultural settings."
