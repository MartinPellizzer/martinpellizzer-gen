    "intro": "Cyclomorium caracasanum, commonly known as the Caracasanum cycloid, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance and aids in its adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Cyclomorium caracasanum thrives in rocky soils and requires a cool, moist climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
