It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The fronds are typically dark green with prominent, dark veins that give the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
