    "intro": "Centaurea ornata var. macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed star-thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking, bright purple to blue flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which are characteristic of the Centaurea genus. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
