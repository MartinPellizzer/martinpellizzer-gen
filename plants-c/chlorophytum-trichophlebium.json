    "intro": "Chlorophytum trichophlebium, commonly known as the snake plant, is a hardy, evergreen perennial native to South Africa. It is characterized by its upright, sword-like leaves that are typically green with white or silver variegation. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low light conditions and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, which helps it survive in arid environments. Additionally, it produces small, inconspicuous flowers on slender stalks, though it is primarily cultivated for its foliage rather than its blooms."
