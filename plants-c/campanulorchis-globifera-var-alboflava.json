    "intro": "Campanulorchis globifera var. alboflava, commonly known as the white-flowered globeflower, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, globe-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. The plant produces intricate, spurred petals that are adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
