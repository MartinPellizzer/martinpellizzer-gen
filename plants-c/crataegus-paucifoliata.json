    "intro": "Crataegus paucifoliata, commonly known as the few-leaved hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny branches, small ovate leaves, and clusters of white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun to partial shade. Crataegus paucifoliata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
