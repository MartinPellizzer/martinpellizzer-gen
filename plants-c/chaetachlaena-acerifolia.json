    "intro": "Chaetachlaena acerifolia, commonly known as the maple-leaved fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that resemble those of maple trees, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds."
