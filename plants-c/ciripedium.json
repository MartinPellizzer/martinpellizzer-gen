    "intro": "Ciripedium, commonly known as the white water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nychthemeralaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting specific pollinators. They typically grow in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. The leaves are broad and floating, while the roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in the mud. Ciripedium species are known for their ornamental value and ecological importance in aquatic ecosystems."
