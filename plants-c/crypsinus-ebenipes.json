    "intro": "Crypsinus ebenipes, commonly known as the ebony tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
