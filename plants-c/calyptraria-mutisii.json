    "intro": "Calyptraria mutisii, commonly known as the M\u00fctz's lichen, is a species of foliose lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its thallus, which is typically greenish to yellowish in color and has a leaf-like structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a green alga, which contributes to its photosynthetic capabilities. It is often found growing on bark, soil, or stone in temperate and subtropical regions. Calyptraria mutisii is notable for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of air quality."
