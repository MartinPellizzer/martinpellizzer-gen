    "intro": "Centaurea sublanata, commonly known as the silky centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, silvery-blue leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces striking, spiky flower heads that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, rocky areas, and along roadsides. Centaurea sublanata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
