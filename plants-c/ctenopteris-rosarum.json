    "intro": "Ctenopteris rosarum, commonly known as the Rosy Spleenwort, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or tree trunks, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Ctenopteris rosarum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
