    "intro": "Crataegus moselemensis var. corrugata, commonly known as the corrugated hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to specific regions of the Middle East. It is characterized by its rough, ridged bark and small, oval leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
