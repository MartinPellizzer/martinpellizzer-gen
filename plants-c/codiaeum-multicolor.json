    "intro": "Codiaeum multicolor, commonly known as the croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, multicolored leaves that range from yellow and red to orange and green. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its striking foliage rather than its flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant and in gardens."
