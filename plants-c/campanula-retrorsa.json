    "intro": "Campanula retrorsa, commonly known as the backward bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that open in the morning and close in the afternoon. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
