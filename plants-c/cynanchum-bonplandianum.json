    "intro": "Cynanchum bonplandianum, commonly known as the bonplandian milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweeds, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milkweed sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. Cynanchum bonplandianum is often found in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows."
