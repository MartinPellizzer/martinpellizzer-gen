    "intro": "Cerasus conglobata, commonly known as the Chinese cherry or wild cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruits are small, red drupes that ripen in summer and are edible, though often used in traditional Chinese medicine. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both horticultural and medicinal purposes."
