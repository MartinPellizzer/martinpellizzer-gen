    "intro": "Cytisus communis, commonly known as the common broom, is a shrub native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and pairs of small, leathery, evergreen leaves. The plant produces bright yellow, pea-like flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. The seeds are enclosed in pods and can remain viable for many years, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
