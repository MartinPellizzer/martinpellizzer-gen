    "intro": "Comocladia mollifolia, commonly known as the silky mangrove, is a tropical shrub native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruits are small, three-lobed berries that turn red when mature. This species is often found in coastal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting local biodiversity."
