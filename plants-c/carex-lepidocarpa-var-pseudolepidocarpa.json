    "intro": "Carex lepidocarpa var. pseudolepidocarpa, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This variety is distinguished by its broader, more robust leaves compared to the typical lepidocarpa, and it produces small, clustered spikelets of brown flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
