    "intro": "Cereus chiloensis var. heteromorphus, commonly known as the Chilean torch cactus, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of Chile. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is well adapted to coastal climates with strong winds and salt spray."
