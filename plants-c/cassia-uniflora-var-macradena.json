It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and pinnately compound leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow, clustered flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Cassia uniflora var. macradena is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
