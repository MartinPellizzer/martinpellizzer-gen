    "intro": "Castanea vesca var. rufa, commonly known as the red-leaf horse chestnut, is a variety of the horse chestnut tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown leaves and showy, white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks, though the seeds are often toxic if not properly prepared. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves turn a striking red or orange in the autumn, adding visual interest to the landscape."
