    "intro": "Cardamine lunaria, commonly known as mooncup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its unique, cup-shaped flowers are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a moonlit appearance. Cardamine lunaria thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
