    "intro": "Carduus helenifolius, commonly known as the Helen's leaf thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
