It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces red berries that contain seeds, and its bark has historically been a source of quinine, used in the treatment of malaria. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters."
