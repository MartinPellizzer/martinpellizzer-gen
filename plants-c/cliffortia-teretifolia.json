    "intro": "Cliffortia teretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cliffortia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing bright yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
