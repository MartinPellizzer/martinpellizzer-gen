    "intro": "Caladium puberulum, commonly known as the velvetleaf caladium, is a tropical perennial plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with striking red or purple veins. The leaves are velvety to the touch, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and prefers partial to full shade. This ornamental plant is often grown for its vibrant foliage rather than its flowers, which are small and inconspicuous."
