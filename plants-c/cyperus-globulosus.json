    "intro": "Cyperus globulosus, commonly known as the globe sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces small, spherical spikelets that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, thriving in areas with standing water. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Cyperus globulosus is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and ability to tolerate waterlogged soils."
