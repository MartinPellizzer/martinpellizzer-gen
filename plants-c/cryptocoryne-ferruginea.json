    "intro": "Cryptocoryne ferruginea, commonly known as the rust-colored cryptocoryne, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves that often have a reddish or rust-colored margin. This plant thrives in moderately lit freshwater environments and is often found in slow-moving streams and ponds. Its rhizomes form dense underwater mats, contributing to water clarity by reducing algae growth. Cryptocoryne ferruginea is popular in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
