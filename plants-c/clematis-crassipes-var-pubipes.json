    "intro": "Clematis crassipes var. pubipes, commonly known as the pubescent clematis, is a deciduous vine native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name \"pubipes.\" The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its growth habit is vigorous, making it suitable for trellises or as a climbing plant in gardens. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that are serrated along the edges."
