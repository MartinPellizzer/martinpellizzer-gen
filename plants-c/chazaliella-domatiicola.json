    "intro": "Chazaliella domatiicola, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and dry, sunny environments. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Chazaliella domatiicola is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
