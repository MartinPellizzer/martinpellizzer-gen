    "intro": "Calycadenia mollis, commonly known as the soft calycadenia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Calycadenia mollis is a perennial species that produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers, often blooming in late spring to early summer."
