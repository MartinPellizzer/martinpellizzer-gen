    "intro": "Coptosperma wajirense, commonly known as the Wajiren mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive bi-lobed shape. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Coptosperma wajirense is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
