    "intro": "Celsia spodiotricha, commonly known as the woolly celsia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy foliage and bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Celsia spodiotricha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
