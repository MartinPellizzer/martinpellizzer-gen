    "intro": "Carex bigelowii subsp. bigelowii, commonly known as Bigelow's sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America, particularly found in moist to wet environments such as marshes and wetlands. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense stands in suitable habitats. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
