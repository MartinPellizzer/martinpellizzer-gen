    "intro": "Cattleya superba, commonly known as the royal cattleya, is a striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, with vibrant colors ranging from white to deep red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Cattleya superba is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and fragrance, making it a popular choice for both indoor cultivation and botanical gardens."
