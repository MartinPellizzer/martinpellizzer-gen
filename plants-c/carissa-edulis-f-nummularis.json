    "intro": "Carissa edulis f. nummularis, commonly known as the dwarf Natal plum, is a compact shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that give way to edible, orange-red fruits resembling tiny plums. These fruits are rich in vitamin C and have a tart, juicy flavor. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
