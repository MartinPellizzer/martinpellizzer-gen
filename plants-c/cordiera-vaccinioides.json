It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that ranges from dark green to reddish hues, especially in winter. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a valuable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for landscape design in suitable climates."
