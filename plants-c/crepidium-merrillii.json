    "intro": "Crepidium merrillii, commonly known as the Hainan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically display a combination of white and green hues. The plant grows as a terrestrial orchid, often found in shaded, moist environments with rich organic soil. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened and requires protection to ensure its survival."
