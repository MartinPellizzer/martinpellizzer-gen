    "intro": "Chamaebuxus venenosa, commonly known as poisonwood, is a toxic evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It has small, glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and emit a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant produces small, red berries that are highly poisonous to humans and animals. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in moist, acidic soils. Despite its toxicity, it plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
