It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in coastal areas."
