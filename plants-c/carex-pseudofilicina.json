It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms."
