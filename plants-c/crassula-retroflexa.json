    "intro": "Crassula retroflexa, commonly known as the Cape rose or rosy crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge, especially when exposed to bright light. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and requiring minimal watering. Crassula retroflexa is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
