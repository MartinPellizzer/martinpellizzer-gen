    "intro": "Chloraea ignea, commonly known as the fiery bellflower, is a striking plant native to the wetlands of southern Australia. It features showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators like birds and insects. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and arranged in a basal rosette. Its scientific name reflects its vivid coloration, with \"ignea\" relating to fire, and \"chloraea\" referring to its greenish foliage. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats."
