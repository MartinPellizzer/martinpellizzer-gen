    "intro": "Capnoides wetherillii, commonly known as the Wetherill's capnoides, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the base of the plant. Capnoides wetherillii is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in local remedies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
