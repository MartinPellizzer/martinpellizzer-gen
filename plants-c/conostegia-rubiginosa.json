    "intro": "Conostegia rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stemmed sandverbena, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils, often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its stems are often reddish or purple in color, which contributes to its common name. Conostegia rubiginosa is adapted to coastal environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ecological value."
