    "intro": "Carex tolmiei var. longiuscula, commonly known as the long-beaked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown to reddish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
