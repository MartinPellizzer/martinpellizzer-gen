    "intro": "Ceropegia \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the string of hearts, is a popular trailing plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, though they are not showy and are often overlooked. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its trailing habit, it is frequently used in hanging baskets or as a trailing plant in gardens and indoor spaces."
