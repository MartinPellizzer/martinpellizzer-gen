    "intro": "Chionanthus leprocarpus, commonly known as the whiteflower ash or white ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Chionanthus leprocarpus is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland habitats."
