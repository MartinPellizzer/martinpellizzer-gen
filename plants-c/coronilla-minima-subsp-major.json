    "intro": "Coronilla minima subsp. major, commonly known as the small crown vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial legume that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are compound, with three oval-shaped leaflets. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often used for erosion control due to its vigorous growth and deep root system."
