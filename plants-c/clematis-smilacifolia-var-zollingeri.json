It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 20 feet, allowing it to climb trees and other structures. The plant produces small, fragrant, white to pale blue flowers in early summer, which are typically clustered in racemes. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is known for its vigorous growth habit. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions."
