    "intro": "Cereus purpureus, commonly known as the purple cactus or night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems covered in spines and its ability to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or purple. Its flowers are short-lived but attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Cereus purpureus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior."
