    "intro": "Carex tibetikobresia, commonly known as the Tibetan sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Carex tibetikobresia plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
