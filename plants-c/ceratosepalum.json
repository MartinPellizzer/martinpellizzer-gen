    "intro": "Ceratosepalum, commonly known as the horned sepal plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like sepals that give the plant its common name. The flowers are typically small and clustered, often with five petals that are fused at the base. Ceratosepalum species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and Madagascar. These plants are often found in moist, shaded environments and are valued for their ornamental appeal."
