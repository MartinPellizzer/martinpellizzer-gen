    "intro": "Cardamine dubia, commonly known as the alpine watercress, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous environments. The plant has slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with three rounded lobes. Its small white or greenish flowers are borne in clusters and bloom in early spring. Cardamine dubia is valued for its delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a wildflower in suitable habitats."
