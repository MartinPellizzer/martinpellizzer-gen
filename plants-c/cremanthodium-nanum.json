It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its diminutive size and delicate flowers make it a notable species in high-altitude flora. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in limited geographic areas, contributing to its rarity."
