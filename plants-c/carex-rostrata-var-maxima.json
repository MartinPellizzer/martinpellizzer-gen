It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding visual interest to wetland habitats. It thrives in moist to wet soils, making it a common sight in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is notable for its robust growth and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
