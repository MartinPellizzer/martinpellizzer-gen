    "intro": "Chimonobambusa quadrangularis f. cyrano-bergeraca, commonly known as the Cyrano-Bergeraca bamboo, is a unique variant of the quadrangular bamboo species. It is characterized by its distinct, four-sided culms that exhibit a striking, almost geometric appearance. This plant thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Its foliage is typically a deep green, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are not showy but are important for reproduction. The plant is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its use in traditional crafts and construction."
