    "intro": "Clerodendrum aculeatum, commonly known as the spiked clerodendrum, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Clerodendrum aculeatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
