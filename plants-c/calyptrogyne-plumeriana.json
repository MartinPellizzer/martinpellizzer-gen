    "intro": "Calyptrogyne plumeriana, commonly known as the broadleaf seagrass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of the Gulf of Mexico. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its submerged or emergent growth in shallow marine environments. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water resistance and enhance photosynthesis in aquatic conditions. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Calyptrogyne plumeriana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for marine life."
