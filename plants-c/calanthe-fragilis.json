    "intro": "Calanthe fragilis, commonly known as the fragrant calanthe, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the rich, organic soil. Calanthe fragilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
