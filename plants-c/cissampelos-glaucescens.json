It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy, bluish-green surface and prominent white veins. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange to red berries containing seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
