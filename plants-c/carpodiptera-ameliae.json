    "intro": "Carpodiptera ameliae, commonly known as the Amelia's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, typically growing on rocky outcrops or in dense forest understories. The plant features intricate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom, giving it a ghostly appearance. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, requiring specific pollinators for successful fertilization. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
