    "intro": "Cereus scandens var. minor, commonly known as the climbing night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
