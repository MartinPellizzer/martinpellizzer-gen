    "intro": "Cedrus libani subsp. brevifolia, commonly known as the Lebanon cedar subspecies with short leaves, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountains of Lebanon. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and short, scale-like leaves that are densely packed on the shoots. The tree produces cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. This subspecies is closely related to the more widely known Cedrus libani, but it is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences."
