It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. Campanula coriacea is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
