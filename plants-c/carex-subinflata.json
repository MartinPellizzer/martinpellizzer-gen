    "intro": "Carex subinflata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct triangular cross-section characteristic of many sedges. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, contributing to its ecological role in wetland habitats."
