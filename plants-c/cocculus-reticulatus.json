    "intro": "Cocculus reticulatus, commonly known as the net-veined morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to purple. The plant produces dark blue or black berries that are typically eaten by birds and small mammals. Its rapid growth habit and ornamental value make it popular in gardens, though it can become invasive if not managed. The botanical features of Cocculus reticulatus make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
