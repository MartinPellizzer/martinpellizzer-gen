    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 ericoi, commonly known as the Ericoidean Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid that results from the cross between Cattleya mossieri and Cattleya ericoides. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, fragrant flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and sometimes yellow. Its pseudobulbs are thick and segmented, supporting its growth in low-light conditions. This orchid is popular among horticulturalists for its beauty and ease of cultivation."
