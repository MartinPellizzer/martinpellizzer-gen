    "intro": "Colchicum bifolium var. pleiophyllum, commonly known as the greater purple crocus, is a member of the Colchicaceae family and is native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has two broad, grass-like leaves that are basal and often persist through the winter. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is notable for its larger and more showy flowers compared to the typical Colchicum bifolium."
