    "intro": "Cynorhiza, commonly known as the rootstock of leguminous plants, is a specialized structure that plays a crucial role in nitrogen fixation. It is the part of the plant that forms a symbiotic relationship with Rhizobia bacteria, which reside in nodules along the root surface. These nodules enable the plant to convert atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form, enriching the soil. The cynorhiza is often used in agricultural practices for soil improvement and crop rotation. Its botanical significance lies in its contribution to sustainable farming and ecological balance."
