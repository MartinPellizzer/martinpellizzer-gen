    "intro": "Comolia stenodon var. suborbicularis, commonly known as the narrow-toothed comolia, is a rare variant of the comolia genus. It is characterized by its distinctive suborbicular leaf shape, which is rounded and slightly heart-shaped. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are usually a deep green, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
