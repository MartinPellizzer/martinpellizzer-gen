    "intro": "Chrysanthemum seticuspe f. boreale, commonly known as the northern chrysanthemum, is a frost-tolerant perennial plant native to the colder regions of northern Europe. It features upright, branched stems that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its foliage is dark green and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal in alpine gardens. This variety is well adapted to poor, well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant in cooler climates."
