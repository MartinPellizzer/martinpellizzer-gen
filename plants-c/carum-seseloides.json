    "intro": "Carum seseloides, commonly known as lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread aggressively in moist, shaded environments. The plant has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowers are typically clustered in umbels, and the plant is known for its peppery scent. Carum seseloides is often found in woodland floors and along stream banks, where it thrives in damp, fertile soil."
