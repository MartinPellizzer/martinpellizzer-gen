    "intro": "Cirsium anglicum, commonly known as the British thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in grasslands, roadsides, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are covered in dense, sharp prickles, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
