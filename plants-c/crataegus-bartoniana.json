    "intro": "Crataegus bartoniana, commonly known as the Barton's hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils in partial to full sun. Crataegus bartoniana is often found in woodland edges and moist habitats, contributing to local biodiversity."
