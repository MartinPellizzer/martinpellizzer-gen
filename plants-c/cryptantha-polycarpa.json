    "intro": "Cryptantha polycarpa, commonly known as the many-fruited cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces multiple small, indehiscent fruits that contain seeds, a feature that distinguishes it from other members of its genus. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Cryptantha polycarpa plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
