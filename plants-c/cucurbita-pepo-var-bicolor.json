    "intro": "Cucurbita pepo var. bicolor, commonly known as the acorn squash, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed, elongated fruit. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine pubescence, while the fruit develops a hard, thick rind that protects the edible seeds and pulp inside. This variety is typically harvested in the fall when the skin has fully hardened and turned a deep orange or yellow color. It is cultivated for its nutritional value and is commonly used in various culinary applications."
