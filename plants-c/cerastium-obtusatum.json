    "intro": "Cerastium obtusatum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early spring, which bloom in dense, bell-shaped clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its distinctive leaf shape and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
