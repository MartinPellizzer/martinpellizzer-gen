It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures, relying on its host plants for nutrients. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies."
