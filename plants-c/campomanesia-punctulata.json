    "intro": "Campomanesia punctulata, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree or ippocarpus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, red, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with glossy, dark green leaves. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces a fragrant, resinous sap that has been used in traditional medicine. Campomanesia punctulata is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its rapid growth rate, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain regions."
