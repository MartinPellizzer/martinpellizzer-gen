    "intro": "Cumulopuntia dimorpha, commonly known as the blue century cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, often forming dense clusters. The plant produces vibrant blue or purple flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by various insects and birds. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Cumulopuntia dimorpha is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and striking appearance."
