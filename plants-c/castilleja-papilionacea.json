    "intro": "Castilleja papilionacea, commonly known as the Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, brush-like inflorescences that resemble miniature paintbrushes. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Castilleja papilionacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
