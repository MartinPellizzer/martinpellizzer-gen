    "intro": "Cranichis ciliilabia, commonly known as the fringed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It features a slender, erect stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf that is often covered in fine, ciliate hairs. The plant produces a spike of small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive, fringed petals and sepals. Its root system consists of a dense network of rhizomes and tubers, which help it survive in its woodland habitat. The species is notable for its unique floral structure and is often found in shaded, moist environments."
