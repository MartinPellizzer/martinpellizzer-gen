    "intro": "Cerastium fontanum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered with fine, soft hairs, which become less prominent as the plant matures. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly succulent texture, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
