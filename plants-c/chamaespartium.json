    "intro": "Chamaespartium, commonly known as the sweet everlasting, is a member of the daisy family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces fluffy, white to light brown seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Chamaespartium is native to the western United States and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
