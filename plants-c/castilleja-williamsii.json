    "intro": "Castilleja williamsii, commonly known as Williams' Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, reddish-orange bract-like flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Castilleja williamsii is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
