It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which includes many succulent species adapted to arid environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive zigzag-shaped stems and fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in spring. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and rockeries."
