    "intro": "Carludovica hookeri, commonly known as the Mexican devil's backbone, is a striking cactus native to Mexico. It features a tall, spiny stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with dark green, ribbed segments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a vibrant contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Carludovica hookeri is well adapted to dry conditions, making it a resilient and visually unique species."
