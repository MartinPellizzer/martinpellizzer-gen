It is characterized by its dense, smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits called samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. This subspecies is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in ecological habitats."
