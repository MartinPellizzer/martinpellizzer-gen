    "intro": "Carya \u00d7 schneckii, commonly known as the mock hickory, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Carya ovata (pecan) and Carya cordiformis (butternut). It is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by oval, woody fruits that mature in the fall. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and horticultural research."
