It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in sharp, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, spherical fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a hardy desert plant. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
