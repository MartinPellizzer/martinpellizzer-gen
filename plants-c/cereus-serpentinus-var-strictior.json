    "intro": "Cereus serpentinus var. strictior, commonly known as the strict cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, spiny stems and a distinctive lack of branching. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a trait common among many cacti adapted to desert environments. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The varietal form 'strictior' refers to its more upright growth habit compared to the typical form of Cereus serpentinus."
