    "intro": "Convolvulus sepium var. dumetorum, commonly known as the creeping wood bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
