    "intro": "Commiphora edulis subsp. holosericea, commonly known as the African gum tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsules that release a fragrant, resinous gum. This gum, known as myrrh, is harvested from the bark and has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and incense. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
