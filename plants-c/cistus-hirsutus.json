    "intro": "Cistus hirsutus, commonly known as the rough rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy foliage and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves and flowers, are used in perfumery and traditional medicine. Cistus hirsutus plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including bees and other pollinators."
