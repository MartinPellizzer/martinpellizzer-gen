    "intro": "Carex meihsienica, commonly known as Meihsien sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas. Carex meihsienica is a perennial plant that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense mats that contribute to ecosystem health."
