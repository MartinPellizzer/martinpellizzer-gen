    "intro": "Castilleja chambersii, commonly known as the Chambers' paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in its native ecosystems."
