    "intro": "Coristospermum lucidum subsp. cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters. It is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
