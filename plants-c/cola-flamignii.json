    "intro": "Cola flamignii, commonly known as the flame cola, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of West Africa, particularly in countries like Nigeria and Cameroon. The plant is characterized by its large, dark green leaves and clusters of bright red, edible fruits. The fruits contain seeds surrounded by a sweet, sticky pulp, which is used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Cola flamignii is considered a vulnerable species."
