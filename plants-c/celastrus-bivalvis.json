    "intro": "Celastrus bivalvis, commonly known as the two-lobed staff-vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a climbing vine that produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters. The plant's leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Celastrus bivalvis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in warm climates."
