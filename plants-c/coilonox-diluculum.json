    "intro": "Coilonox diluculum, commonly known as the dawn's breath fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features intricate, lace-like fronds that unfurl gradually throughout the day, responding to light and humidity. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with consistently moist, well-draining soil. Its spores are released in the early morning, coinciding with the first light of day, hence its common name. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
