    "intro": "Chelonopsis chekiangensis var. chekiangensis, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to eastern China. It belongs to the family Salviniaceae and is characterized by its floating, finely divided fronds that resemble a delicate lace. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including small, spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
