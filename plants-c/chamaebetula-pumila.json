    "intro": "Chamaebetula pumila, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small shrub native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by small, winged fruits. It thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and taiga ecosystems. Chamaebetula pumila plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
