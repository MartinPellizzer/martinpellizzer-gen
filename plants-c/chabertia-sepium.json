    "intro": "Chabertia sepium, commonly known as the lesser mouse-ear, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, grassy areas and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant has a creeping growth habit and produces a fruit known as a cypsela, which is dispersed by wind. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and woodland edges. Chabertia sepium is not typically cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and morphological features."
