    "intro": "Croton dussii, commonly known as the desert croton, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which later develop into capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Croton dussii is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptations to survive in extreme climatic conditions."
