    "intro": "Chrysanthemum umbelliferum, commonly known as the umbrella chrysanthemum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its clustered, umbrella-like arrangement of small yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has linear, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
