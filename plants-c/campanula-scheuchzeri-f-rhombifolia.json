    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri f. rhombifolia, commonly known as the rhombifoliate bellflower, is a rare and striking plant characterized by its distinctive foliage. It features broad, rhombic-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the alpine regions of Europe, it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
