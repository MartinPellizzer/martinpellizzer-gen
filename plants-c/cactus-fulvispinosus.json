    "intro": "Cactus fulvispinosus, commonly known as the yellow-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in yellow spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments. Its unique morphology and resilience make it an interesting subject for both botanical study and horticultural cultivation."
