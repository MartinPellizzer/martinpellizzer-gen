It is characterized by its striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland borders. Campanula cantabrica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
