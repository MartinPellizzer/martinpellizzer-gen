    "intro": "Cyclosorus dimorphus, commonly known as the two-form water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, paired leaves that give it a clover-like appearance. This plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. It is often found in shallow waters with soft, muddy substrates. Cyclosorus dimorphus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water clarity through its filtration activities."
