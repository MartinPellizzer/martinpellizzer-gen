It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
