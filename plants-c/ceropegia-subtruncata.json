    "intro": "Ceropegia subtruncata, commonly known as the African violet or the string of hearts, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features trailing stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its compact growth habit, it is a popular choice for hanging baskets and container gardening."
