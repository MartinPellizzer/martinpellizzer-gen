    "intro": "Casuarina sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran ironwood, is a tall, evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are arranged in cylindrical clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in coastal areas and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it suitable for dune stabilization. Casuarina sumatrana is also valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in preventing soil erosion."
