    "intro": "Cuscuta macrocarpa, commonly known as giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth rate, often smothering its host. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, hair-like structures that help it attach to its host. It is native to North America and can be found in various habitats, including fields and gardens. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants."
