It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its tiny, clustered leaves and small white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and fragile growth habits, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
