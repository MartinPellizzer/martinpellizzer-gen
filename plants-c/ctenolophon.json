    "intro": "Ctenolophon, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that resemble a sea creature, hence its common name. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in coastal areas with well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Ctenolophon is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
