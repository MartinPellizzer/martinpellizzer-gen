    "intro": "Cuscuta remotiflora, commonly known as the distant-flowered dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found parasitizing crops and wild plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
