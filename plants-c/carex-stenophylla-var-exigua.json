    "intro": "Carex stenophylla var. exigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream edges. The plant features grass-like leaves that are narrow and dark green, with a dense, compact growth habit. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are usually borne on slender, branching stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments."
