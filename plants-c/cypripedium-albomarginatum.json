    "intro": "Cypripedium albomarginatum, commonly known as the white-margin lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that feature a white lip with a distinctive yellow margin, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest floors, where it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
