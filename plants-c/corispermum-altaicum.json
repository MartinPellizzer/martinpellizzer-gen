    "intro": "Corispermum altaicum, commonly known as the Siberian sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, dry fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry steppe and desert environments. Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh climates."
