    "intro": "Cyrtomium caducum, commonly known as the deciduous water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream sides. Its leaves are usually pinnately divided and shed seasonally, which is a distinctive feature of its deciduous nature. Cyrtomium caducum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
