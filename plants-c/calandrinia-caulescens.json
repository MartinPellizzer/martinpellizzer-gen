    "intro": "Calandrinia caulescens, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces vibrant pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and the stems are erect and branching. Calandrinia caulescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
