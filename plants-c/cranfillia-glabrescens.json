    "intro": "Cranfillia glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth cranfillia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
