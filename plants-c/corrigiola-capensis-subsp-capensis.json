    "intro": "Corrigiola capensis subsp. capensis, commonly known as the Cape sandplume, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and inland arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
