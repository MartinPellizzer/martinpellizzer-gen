    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 estonica, commonly known as the hybrid hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Europe. It is a natural hybrid between Crataegus monogyna (common hawthorn) and Crataegus laevigata (smooth hawthorn). The plant is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. It produces small, red berries in the fall, which are edible but often used in jams and wines. Crataegus \u00d7 estonica is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
