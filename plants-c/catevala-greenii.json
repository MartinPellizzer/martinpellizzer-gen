    "intro": "Catevala greenii, commonly known as the green spire orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that can reach up to two meters in height, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Catevala greenii is considered a conservation concern."
