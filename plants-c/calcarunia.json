    "intro": "Calcarunia, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that resemble orchids, though it is not closely related to true orchids. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring arid or semi-arid environments. Calcarunia species are generally small, with narrow leaves and showy, brightly colored blooms. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in mountainous regions and is considered a rare or endangered species in many areas."
