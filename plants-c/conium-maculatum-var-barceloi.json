    "intro": "Conium maculatum var. barceloi, commonly known as the Barceloi hemlock, is a variant of the poison hemlock plant. It is a biennial herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, particularly coniine, which can be fatal to humans and animals if ingested. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields. Due to its toxicity, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
