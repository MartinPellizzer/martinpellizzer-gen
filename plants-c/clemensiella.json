    "intro": "Clemensiella, commonly known as the rock cress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from white to purple. The plants are often found growing in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Clemensiella species are generally herbaceous, with basal leaves that are often lobed or divided. They play a role in stabilizing soil in their native habitats and are of interest to botanists due to their adaptability to harsh conditions."
