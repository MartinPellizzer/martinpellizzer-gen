    "intro": "Cupressus karnaliensis var. mustangensis, commonly known as the Mustang cypress, is a rare and endemic coniferous tree native to the high-altitude regions of Nepal. It belongs to the family Cupressaceae and is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and dense, scale-like foliage. The plant exhibits a unique combination of morphological traits, including needle-like leaves and woody cones, typical of the cypress genus. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
