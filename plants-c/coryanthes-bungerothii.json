    "intro": "Coryanthes bungerothii, commonly known as the Bunge's hooded orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height, with a unique hood-like structure formed by the sepals and petals. The plant produces a distinctive column that bears multiple pollinia, which are essential for its reproductive process. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
