    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 nobilis subf. deliciosa, commonly known as the grapefruit, is a citrus fruit characterized by its thick, yellowish rind and segmented, juicy flesh. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of South America, though it is now widely cultivated in subtropical regions. The plant is a small evergreen shrub with fragrant, glossy leaves and clusters of white flowers that develop into the familiar fruit. Its fruit is rich in vitamin C and contains a high concentration of sugars and acids. The subsp. deliciosa is notable for its distinct flavor profile and its use in both culinary and medicinal applications."
