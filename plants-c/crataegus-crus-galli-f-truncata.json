    "intro": "Crataegus crus-galli f. truncata, commonly known as the dwarf hawthorn or the broom hawthorn, is a compact shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its short stature, typically reaching only 1 to 2 meters in height, and its dense, rounded growth habit. The plant features small, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring. Its fruit is a small, red berry that ripens in late summer, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. This form is a natural variant of the common hawthorn, distinguished by its more compact structure."
