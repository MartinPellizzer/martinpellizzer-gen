    "intro": "Centella triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered centella, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers, which are often borne in groups of three, giving it its common name. Centella triflora is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
