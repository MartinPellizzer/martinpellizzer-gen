    "intro": "Carpogymnia oyamensis, commonly known as the Oyama carpogymnia, is a rare and specialized lichen-forming species belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive thallus structure, which consists of a dense, leathery cortex and a loosely aggregated medulla. The plant exhibits a unique chemical composition, including the presence of specific depsidones and other secondary metabolites. It typically grows on shaded, moist rock surfaces in temperate forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions."
