    "intro": "Carica dodecaphylla, commonly known as the twelve-leaf papaya, is a tropical plant belonging to the Caricaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that often have 12 leaflets, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow-orange fruits that are similar in appearance to the common papaya but are less widely cultivated. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The fruit is edible and contains enzymes that aid in digestion, similar to other papaya species."
