    "intro": "Carex basiflora, commonly known as the basal-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly rough to the touch. Its flowering occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, clustered spikelets that are often pale green or brown. The plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
