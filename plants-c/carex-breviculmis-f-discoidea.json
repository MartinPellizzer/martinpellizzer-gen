    "intro": "Carex breviculmis f. discoidea, commonly known as the disk-shaped sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, rounded inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This ornamental sedge is valued for its ability to provide habitat for aquatic insects and its aesthetic appeal in water garden settings."
