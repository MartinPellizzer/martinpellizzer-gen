    "intro": "Corydalis diffusa, commonly known as the spreading poppy, is a herbaceous perennial native to temperate regions of Asia. It features delicate, creeping stems that often form dense mats, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, typically in early spring. Its flowers are borne on slender pedicels and have two upper petals that are often reflexed. Corydalis diffusa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland or shaded garden settings."
