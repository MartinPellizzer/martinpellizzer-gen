    "intro": "Chamaesyce carissoides, commonly known as the prickly cholla, is a species of flowering plant in the family Portulacaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spiny tubercles, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the spring and summer months. Chamaesyce carissoides is well adapted to desert conditions, with a deep root system and the ability to store water in its succulent stems."
