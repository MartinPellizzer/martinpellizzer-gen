    "intro": "Croton fragilis var. sericeus, commonly known as silver croton, is a striking ornamental plant characterized by its soft, velvety foliage. The leaves are typically broad, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of silvery or whitish hairs, giving it a shimmering appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. This species thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in tropical and subtropical gardens."
