    "intro": "Calathea makoyana, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that often feature intricate patterns in shades of green, white, and silver. The plant's leaves fold upwards at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty, which is thought to help reduce water loss. Calathea makoyana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
