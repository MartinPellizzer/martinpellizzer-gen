    "intro": "Carlomohria diptera, commonly known as the golden-winged fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are covered in fine, golden hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are released in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of its leaves. The golden-winged fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
