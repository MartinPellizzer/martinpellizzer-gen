    "intro": "Cocos gaertneri, commonly known as the Gaertner's coconut, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces clusters of fibrous, hairy fruits that contain a single, large seed. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Despite its resemblance to the coconut palm, it is not closely related to the true coconut species."
