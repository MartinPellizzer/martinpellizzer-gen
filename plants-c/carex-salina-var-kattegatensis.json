    "intro": "Carex salina var. kattegatensis, commonly known as the Kattegat saltmarsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Northern Europe. It thrives in saline and brackish wetland environments, often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to tolerate high salt concentrations. It produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils. This variety is valued for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects along shorelines."
