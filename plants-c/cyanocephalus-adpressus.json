It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and distinctive blue to violet-colored flowers. The plant produces small, spherical fruits known as schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant flower color and compact growth habit."
