    "intro": "Citrus oxanthera, commonly known as the oxanthera citrus, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rutaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its fragrant, small, and often yellow or orange-colored flowers, which are typical of the citrus genus. Its leaves are usually ovate with a glossy surface, and it produces small, round fruits that are not widely consumed by humans. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity rather than a commercially significant citrus species."
