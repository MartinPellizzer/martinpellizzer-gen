    "intro": "Cochlianthus gracilis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring or early summer, producing pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cochlianthus gracilis is considered a vulnerable species."
