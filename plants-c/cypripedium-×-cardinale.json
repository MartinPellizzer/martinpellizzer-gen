    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 cardinale, commonly known as the cardinal lady's tresses, is a hybrid orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers with a distinctive green throat, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a dense rosette. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, often growing on the forest floor. It has a long flowering period, typically from late spring to early summer, and is valued for its ornamental beauty. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
