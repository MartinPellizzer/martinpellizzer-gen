    "intro": "Ceriops lucida, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and the Caribbean. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in coastal areas and estuaries. The plant has a distinctive, gnarled trunk and waxy, thick leaves that help reduce water loss in its saline habitat. Its roots form a complex network that stabilizes coastal soils and prevents erosion. Ceriops lucida plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
