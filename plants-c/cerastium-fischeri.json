    "intro": "Cerastium fischeri, commonly known as the Fischer's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense rosettes of small, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cerastium fischeri is considered a rare and endangered species."
