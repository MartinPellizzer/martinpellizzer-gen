    "intro": "Cecropia metensis, commonly known as the giant water willow, is a fast-growing tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and long, drooping inflorescences that produce small, greenish flowers. The plant thrives in moist, often swampy habitats and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its hollow stems are often used as nesting sites by birds and other animals. Cecropia metensis plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various species."
