It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, woodland edges, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 millimeters wide, giving it a delicate appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of certain wetland and grassland ecosystems."
