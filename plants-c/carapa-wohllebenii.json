    "intro": "Carapa wohllebenii, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody, capsule-like fruits containing up to 20 seeds. These seeds, known as Brazil nuts, are enclosed in a hard shell and are rich in nutrients, particularly oils and proteins. Carapa wohllebenii plays a vital ecological role in the rainforest, providing habitat and food for various species."
