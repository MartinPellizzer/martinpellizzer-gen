    "intro": "Calamus khasianus, commonly known as the Khasi reed, is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae). It is a tall, herbaceous plant that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its long, slender stems and broad, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces an inflorescence known as a spadix, which is surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Calamus khasianus is native to the northeastern regions of India and is often found in moist, shaded forest areas. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine and for making handicrafts."
