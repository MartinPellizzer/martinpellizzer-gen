    "intro": "Cyclostemon indicus, commonly known as the Indian cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the family Cycadaceae. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant is native to southern India and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. It produces cones instead of flowers, with the male cones releasing pollen that is wind-dispersed. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
