    "intro": "Colchicum monogynum, commonly known as the single-flowered autumn crocus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the British Isles. It produces striking violet-blue flowers in late summer to early autumn, typically emerging from a corm-like bulb. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hidden beneath the soil until flowering. Its flowers are borne on tall, erect stems and are surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Colchicum monogynum is notable for its medicinal properties, as it contains colchicine, a compound used in treating gout and certain types of cancer."
