    "intro": "Cerastium subsimile, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowers are typically arranged in umbels, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Cerastium subsimile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
