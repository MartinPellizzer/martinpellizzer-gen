    "intro": "Clematis villosa, commonly known as the hairy clematis, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 3\u20135 inches in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Clematis villosa thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a climbing plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to climb trellises or walls, adding vertical interest to garden landscapes."
