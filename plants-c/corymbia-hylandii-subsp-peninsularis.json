    "intro": "Corymbia hylandii subsp. peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular bloodwood, is a rare and endemic species found in the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its rough, fissured bark and distinctive reddish-brown to pale grey foliage. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
