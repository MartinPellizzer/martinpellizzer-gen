    "intro": "Chloris ventricosa, commonly known as the bladder grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive seed heads that are inflated and resemble bladders, giving it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along coastal areas. Chloris ventricosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native gardens."
