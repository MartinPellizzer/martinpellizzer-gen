It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage that forms dense clumps, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
