    "intro": "Campanula glomerata var. serotina, commonly known as the late bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features clustered bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn, typically in shades of blue to purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland edges. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
