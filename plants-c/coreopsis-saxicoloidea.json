    "intro": "Coreopsis saxicoloidea, commonly known as the rock coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky, arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to conserve moisture. Coreopsis saxicoloidea is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and minimal maintenance requirements."
