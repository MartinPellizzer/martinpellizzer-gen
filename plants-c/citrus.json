    "intro": "Citrus, commonly known as the citrus family, includes a variety of plants such as oranges, lemons, limes, and grapefruits. These plants are characterized by their evergreen leaves, which are typically oval and have a glossy surface. The fruit of citrus plants is typically citrusy, containing a juicy, segmented pulp surrounded by a white, spongy membrane called the pith. Citrus trees are evergreen shrubs or small trees that thrive in warm climates and require well-drained soil. They are widely cultivated for their fruit, which is rich in vitamins and used in culinary and medicinal applications."
