    "intro": "Caralluma dalzielii, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes, and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its thick, waxy leaves help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Caralluma dalzielii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
