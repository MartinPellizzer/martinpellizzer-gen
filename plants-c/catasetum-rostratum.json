    "intro": "Catasetum rostratum, commonly known as the rostrated orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often feature a unique, elongated structure at the base of the lip, known as the rostrum. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with contrasting purple or red markings, attracting specific pollinators like bees and wasps. The genus Catasetum is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms, and Catasetum rostratum is no exception."
