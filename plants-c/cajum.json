    "intro": "Cajum, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It features smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries. Cajum is often found in wetlands and coastal areas, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
