It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and often toothed, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the summer months. Its root system is adapted to tolerate saline and sandy soils, making it well-suited for coastal environments. The plant is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
