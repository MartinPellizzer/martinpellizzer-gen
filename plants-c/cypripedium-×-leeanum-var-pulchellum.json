    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 leeanum var. pulchellum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking pink and white petals and a pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires well-drained, acidic soils. It has a pseudobulb structure and produces a single, showy flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered in some regions."
