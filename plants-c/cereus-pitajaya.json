    "intro": "Cereus pitajaya, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cacti species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its growth is slow, and it can live for many years, making it a long-lived plant. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they emit a sweet scent to aid in pollination."
