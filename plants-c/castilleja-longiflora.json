    "intro": "Castilleja longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, leafless stems that often grow in association with other vegetation, relying on its host plants for some of its nutrients. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with fungi, which help it absorb water and minerals from the soil. Castilleja longiflora is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands."
