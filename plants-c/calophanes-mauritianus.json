    "intro": "Calophanes mauritianus, commonly known as the Mauritius starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Mauritius. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant grows in rocky or coastal habitats and is adapted to the island's unique climate and soil conditions. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calophanes mauritianus is considered a vulnerable species."
