    "intro": "Cassinia fulvida var. linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistflower, is a perennial shrub native to Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flower heads that are clustered in dense, spherical clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
