    "intro": "Cambessedesia rugosa var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, narrow leaves and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The varietal name *latifolia* refers to its broader leaf structure compared to the typical species."
