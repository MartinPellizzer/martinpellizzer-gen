    "intro": "Cyperus microcarpus, commonly known as the dwarf sedges, is a member of the Cyperaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like appearance and triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its small, three-ranked leaves and tiny, spike-like flowers are typical of the sedge family. Cyperus microcarpus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
