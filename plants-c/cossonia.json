    "intro": "Cossonia, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. Cossonia species are known for their hard, heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. These plants often thrive in dry, rocky habitats and are adapted to arid environments."
