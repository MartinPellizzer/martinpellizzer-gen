It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its rosette of small, hairy, oval leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in gardens, woodlands, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
