    "intro": "Cymopterus cinerarius, commonly known as the grayleaf evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the genus Cymopterus in the family Onagraceae, which includes other evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cymopterus cinerarius is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in semi-desert conditions."
