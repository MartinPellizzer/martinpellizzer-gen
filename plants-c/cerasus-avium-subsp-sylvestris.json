    "intro": "Cerasus avium subsp. sylvestris, commonly known as the wild cherry, is a subspecies of the cherry tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible berries that ripen to a dark red or black color. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the wood is strong and used in various crafts. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks."
