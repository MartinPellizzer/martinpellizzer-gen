    "intro": "Chlorophytum debile, commonly known as spider plant, is a popular ornamental plant native to South Africa. It is a perennial herb with long, arching stems that bear small, grass-like leaves. The plant produces white or greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, dangling plantlets that can be easily propagated. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, making it ideal for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. Its ability to purify air and tolerate low light conditions adds to its widespread appeal."
