    "intro": "Cumetea divaricata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a spicy or peppery taste. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
