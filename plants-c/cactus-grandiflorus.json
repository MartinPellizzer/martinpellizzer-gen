    "intro": "Cactus grandiflorus, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 15 feet in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white, yellow, or pink. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid environments with minimal water. Its thick, waxy skin helps reduce water loss, making it well adapted to desert conditions."
