    "intro": "Chenopodium oleraceum, commonly known as lamb's quarters, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving them a bluish-gray appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, followed by edible, triangular seeds that are rich in nutrients. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields. It is considered a weed in many areas but is also cultivated for its edible leaves and seeds."
