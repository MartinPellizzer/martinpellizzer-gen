These plants are native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. Calea species are characterized by their striking, showy flowers that often open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The leaves are typically opposite and have a velvety texture, while the flowers come in various colors, including white, yellow, and pink. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value and unique blooming habits."
