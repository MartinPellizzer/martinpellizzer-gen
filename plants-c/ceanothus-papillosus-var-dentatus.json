It features small, clustered leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
