    "intro": "Cedrus brevifolia, commonly known as the Lebanon cedar, is a species of coniferous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are short and dense. The tree produces small, yellowish-green cones that mature into dark brown, woody cones containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with cold winters and warm, dry summers. Due to its historical and cultural significance, it is also considered a symbol of resilience and endurance."
