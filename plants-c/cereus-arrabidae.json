    "intro": "Cereus arrabidae, commonly known as the Portuguese night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the Azores. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well-adapted to coastal environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior."
