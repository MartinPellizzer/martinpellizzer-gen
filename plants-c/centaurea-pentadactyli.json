    "intro": "Centaurea pentadactyli, commonly known as the five-finger centaurea, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its name refers to the five lobes of the leaf, which resemble fingers, and the five-rayed flowers that bloom in summer. Centaurea pentadactyli is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along coastal areas."
