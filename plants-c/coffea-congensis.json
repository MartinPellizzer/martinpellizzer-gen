    "intro": "Coffea congensis, commonly known as the Ethiopian coffee plant, is a species native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries containing two seeds, which are the coffee beans used for brewing. It thrives in tropical climates with high altitudes, moderate temperatures, and well-drained soil. Coffea congensis is one of the primary species used in the production of Arabica coffee, contributing to its distinct flavor profile."
