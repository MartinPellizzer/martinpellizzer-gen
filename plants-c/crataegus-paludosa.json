    "intro": "Crataegus paludosa, commonly known as the swamp hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to wetland areas of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has compound leaves with 5 to 9 pairs of leaflets, and it produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring. Its fruit is a red, fleshy pome that ripens in the fall, providing food for various wildlife species. The species is notable for its adaptability to wet conditions and its role in stabilizing shoreline ecosystems."
