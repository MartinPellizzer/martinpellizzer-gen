    "intro": "Cremopyrum pectinatum var. calvum, commonly known as the smooth leaf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale to yellowish-green thallus with a smooth, often shiny surface. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, instead forming a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacteria. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in moist, shaded environments. This variety is distinguished by its reduced pycnidia and lacks the peltate structures found in other varieties of Cremopyrum."
