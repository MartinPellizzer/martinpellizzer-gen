    "intro": "Clidemia bracteata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in clusters. Clidemia bracteata is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it a common invasive species in certain regions."
