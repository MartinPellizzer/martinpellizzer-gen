    "intro": "Cassinia phylicifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cassinia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flower heads that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Cassinia phylicifolia is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils."
