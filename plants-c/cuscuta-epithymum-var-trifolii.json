    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum var. trifolii, commonly known as the three-leaved dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, white or yellow flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that wraps around its host. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, lobed leaflets. It is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants in various habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and ornamental plants."
