    "intro": "Caucalis fallax var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed caucalis, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly succulent texture. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on short, erect stalks. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is occasionally grown in gardens for its delicate appearance."
