    "intro": "Ceratophyllum apiculatum, commonly known as the spike milfoil, is a freshwater plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving water, often forming thick mats on the surface. It produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. Ceratophyllum apiculatum is often used in aquatic gardening and can serve as a habitat for various aquatic organisms."
