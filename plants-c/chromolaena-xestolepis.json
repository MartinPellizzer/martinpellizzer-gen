    "intro": "Chromolaena xestolepis, commonly known as the croton weed, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually green with a reddish underside. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers followed by orange or red berries. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas but has become invasive in parts of Africa and Asia. Due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation, it is considered a significant weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
