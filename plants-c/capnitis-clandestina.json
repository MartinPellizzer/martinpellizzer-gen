It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in dense forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Capnitis clandestina is considered a vulnerable species."
