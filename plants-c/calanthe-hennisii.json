    "intro": "Calanthe hennisii, commonly known as the Hennis' calanthe, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and produces striking, often fragrant, flowers in shades of white, pink, and violet. The plant typically features broad, lance-shaped leaves and blooms during the spring or early summer. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate species that is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
