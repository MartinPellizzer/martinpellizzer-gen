    "intro": "Cystopteris nodosa, commonly known as the nodding water fern, is a species of aquatic fern characterized by its delicate, floating fronds. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams, where it thrives in still or slow-moving water. The fronds are divided into small, pinnate segments and often have a reddish tinge when submerged. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the undersides of the fronds. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important indicator species for aquatic ecosystems."
