    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to western Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, depending on the variety, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
