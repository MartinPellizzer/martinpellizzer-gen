    "intro": "Cissus forsteniana, commonly known as the Forsten's devil's ivy, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
