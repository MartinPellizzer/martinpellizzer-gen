    "intro": "Cycas petrae, commonly known as the Petra cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. Native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa, it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cycas petrae is considered a vulnerable species."
