    "intro": "Colchicum asteroides, commonly known as the star lily, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has a short, stout stem that supports its showy inflorescence, which consists of several overlapping petals. Its leaves are basal, grass-like, and often withering before flowering. Colchicum asteroides is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
