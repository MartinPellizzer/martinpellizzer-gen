It features pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges and produces bright yellow inflorescences that bloom in summer. The plant is characterized by its slender, woody stems and can grow up to 5 meters in height. Its flowers are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds, contributing to its ecological significance. The seeds are encased in pods that split open to release the seeds, aiding in its propagation."
