    "intro": "Cerastium tenoreanum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers, typically in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
