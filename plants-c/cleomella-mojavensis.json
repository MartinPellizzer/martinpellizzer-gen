    "intro": "Cleomella mojavensis, commonly known as the Mojave cleomella, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Cleomaceae family, which includes several species adapted to dry environments. The plant typically grows as a low, mat-forming shrub with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Cleomella mojavensis is well adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal water availability."
