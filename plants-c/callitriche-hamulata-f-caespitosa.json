It belongs to the Haloragaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval leaves arranged in whorls along its stems. The plant typically forms dense clusters, which help it anchor in soft substrates and compete for light. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often floating on the water surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
