    "intro": "Carduus tenuiflorus var. corbariensis, commonly known as the narrow-flowered thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, wastelands, and disturbed soils. The plant features a robust taproot and spiny, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pale purple to white, arranged in a single, erect head, and are visited by various pollinators. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more delicate flower heads compared to the typical form of Carduus tenuiflorus."
