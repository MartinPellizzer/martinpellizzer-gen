It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained soil. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex olbiensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for various invertebrates."
