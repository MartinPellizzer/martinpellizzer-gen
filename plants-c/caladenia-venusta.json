The flower has a vivid pink to red coloration with intricate markings, and its sepals and petals are elongated and narrow. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats, often in heathlands or woodlands. The plant is pollinated by insects, particularly wasps, and is noted for its ecological significance in supporting local biodiversity."
