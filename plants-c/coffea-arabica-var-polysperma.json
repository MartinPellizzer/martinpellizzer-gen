    "intro": "Coffea arabica var. polysperma, commonly known as the Ethiopian coffee plant, is a variant of the Arabica coffee species native to Ethiopia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped berries that typically contain two seeds, though it can occasionally produce three. The plant thrives in high-altitude regions with cool temperatures and high rainfall, making it well-suited for cultivation in the Ethiopian highlands. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, and the flowers are white with a strong fragrance. This variety is valued for its unique flavor profile, which includes notes of citrus and floral undertones."
