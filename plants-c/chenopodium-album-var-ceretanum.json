It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with reddish stems that become more pronounced as the plant matures. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in agricultural fields."
