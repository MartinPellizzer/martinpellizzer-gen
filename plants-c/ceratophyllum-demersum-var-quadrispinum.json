    "intro": "Ceratophyllum demersum var. quadrispinum, commonly known as the spiked hornwort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, bright green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant lacks true roots and instead has rhizoids that anchor it to substrates. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. This species is often used in aquariums and ponds for its ability to oxygenate water and provide habitat for aquatic life."
