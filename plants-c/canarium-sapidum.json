It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant yellow flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain a hard, oily seed used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. Its latex, which is milky and sticky, has been historically used for various purposes, including as a chewing gum. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in providing habitat and contributing to soil stability in tropical forests."
