    "intro": "Calandrinia maritima, commonly known as sea purslane, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by fleshy, succulent leaves and small, pink or reddish flowers. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments and along shorelines. Its ability to tolerate salt and drought makes it well adapted to harsh coastal conditions. Calandrinia maritima is also known for its edible leaves, which are used in some traditional cuisines."
