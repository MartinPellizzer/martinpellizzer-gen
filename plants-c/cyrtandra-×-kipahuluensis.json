    "intro": "Cyrtandra \u00d7 kipahuluensis, commonly known as the Kipahulu hybrid, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Hawaiian island of Maui. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within the montane rainforests of the island. Cyrtandra \u00d7 kipahuluensis is notable for its hybrid origin, resulting from the cross between Cyrtandra pedata and Cyrtandra hawaiiensis. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
