    "intro": "Cistus berthelotianus, commonly known as the Berthelot's rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are covered in glandular hairs that secrete essential oils, contributing to its strong fragrance. The species is also noted for its ability to form dense thickets, which can help prevent soil erosion in its natural habitat."
