    "intro": "Cordia bonplandiana, commonly known as the Amazonian gloryflower, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the dense forest environment. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local communities."
