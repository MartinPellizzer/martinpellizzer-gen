    "intro": "Crotalaria mitchellii subsp. mitchellii, commonly known as Mitchell's crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species characterized by its erect stem and palmate leaves. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. The seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to release the seeds, aiding in the plant's dispersal."
