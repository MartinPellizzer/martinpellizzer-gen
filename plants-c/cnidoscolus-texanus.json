    "intro": "Cnidoscolus texanus, commonly known as the Mexican stinging leaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central America and northern South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stinging hairs called trichomes. These hairs release an irritant when touched, which can cause a painful rash in humans. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into spiny, berry-like fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional medicinal uses."
