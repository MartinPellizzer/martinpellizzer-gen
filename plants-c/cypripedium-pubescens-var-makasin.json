    "intro": "Cypripedium pubescens var. makasin, commonly known as the Makasin lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring rich, humus-filled soil. Its flowers are usually pink or reddish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
