    "intro": "Colysis hemionitidea, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a tall, erect stem with narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in dry soils. Colysis hemionitidea plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
