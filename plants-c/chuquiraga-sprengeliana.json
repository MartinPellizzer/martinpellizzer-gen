    "intro": "Chuquiraga sprengeliana, commonly known as the Andean burflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The plant's unique adaptations make it a resilient species in its native ecosystem."
