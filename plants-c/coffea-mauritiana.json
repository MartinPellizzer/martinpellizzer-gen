    "intro": "Coffea mauritiana, commonly known as the Mauritius coffee or wild coffee, is a species native to the Mascarene Islands. It is a small evergreen shrub that produces small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant's fruits are berries that turn red when mature, containing one or two seeds. It is closely related to the more widely cultivated Coffea arabica and C. canephora. Due to its limited distribution and genetic diversity, it is considered a valuable species for coffee breeding programs."
