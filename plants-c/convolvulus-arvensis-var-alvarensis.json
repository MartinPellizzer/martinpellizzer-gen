    "intro": "Convolvulus arvensis var. alvarensis, commonly known as the creeping wood bindweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural settings."
