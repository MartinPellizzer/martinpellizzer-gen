    "intro": "Celosia glauca, commonly known as the blue celosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, plume-like inflorescences that range in color from red to blue. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Celosia glauca is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
