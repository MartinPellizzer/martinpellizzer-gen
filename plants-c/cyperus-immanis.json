    "intro": "Cyperus immanis, commonly known as the giant flatsedge, is a robust perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, clustered flower heads that are usually pale green or brown. Cyperus immanis is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread aggressively in suitable environments. It is often considered a weed in agricultural and aquatic settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
