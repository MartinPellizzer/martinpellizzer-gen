    "intro": "Chamaesyce multiformis var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved sandweed, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically yellow or greenish-yellow, which are adapted for pollination by wind or small insects. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. This species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in disturbed or open habitats."
