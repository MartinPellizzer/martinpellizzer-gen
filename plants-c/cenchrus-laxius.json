    "intro": "Cenchrus laxius, commonly known as the slender porcupine grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, tufted foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous short, stiff, bristle-like spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. Cenchrus laxius is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, arid environments."
