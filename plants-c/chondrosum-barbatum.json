    "intro": "Chondrosum barbatum, commonly known as the beard lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dark, leathery thallus with a distinctive, fuzzy margin that resembles a beard, giving it its common name. The lichen is typically found growing on bark, stone, or wood in shaded, moist environments. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic alga or cyanobacteria. Chondrosum barbatum is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants."
