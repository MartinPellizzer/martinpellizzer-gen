    "intro": "Cephalocereus columna-trajani, commonly known as the Trajan's column cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and sparse, spiny foliage. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh desert conditions. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in dry gardens and rockeries."
