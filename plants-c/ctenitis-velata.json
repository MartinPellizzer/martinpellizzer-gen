    "intro": "Ctenitis velata, commonly known as the velvety ctenitis, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth. Its fronds are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the fronds."
