    "intro": "Cyperus esculentus, commonly known as chufa or earth almond, is a perennial plant native to Africa and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant's most notable botanical feature is its edible tuberous root, which is rich in nutrients and has a nutty flavor. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the stems are typically erect and branched. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water margins."
