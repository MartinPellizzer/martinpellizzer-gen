It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. Cirsium nothum is often found in meadows and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun."
