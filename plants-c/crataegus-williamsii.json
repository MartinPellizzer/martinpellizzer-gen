It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are edible but often tart. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and horticultural use in native plant gardens."
