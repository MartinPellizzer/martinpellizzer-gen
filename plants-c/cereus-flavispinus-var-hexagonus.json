    "intro": "Cereus flavispinus var. hexagonus, commonly known as the yellow-spined hedge cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered with areoles. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems forming a dense, compact structure. This cactus is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
