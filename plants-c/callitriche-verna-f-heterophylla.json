    "intro": "Callitriche verna f. heterophylla, commonly known as the spring water starwort, is a aquatic plant characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant exhibits a distinct morphological variation in its foliage, with the 'heterophylla' form showing differences in leaf shape and size compared to the typical form. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often appearing in clusters, and it is primarily pollinated by insects. This plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
