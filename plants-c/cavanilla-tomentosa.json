    "intro": "Cavanilla tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy cavanilla, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, hairy stems and broad, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
