    "intro": "Cheilanthes jurgensii, commonly known as the Jurgens' rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with clustered, orbicular to ovate leaves that are usually gray-green in color. Its fronds are usually unlobed and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Cheilanthes jurgensii is adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in regions with a Mediterranean or desert climate."
