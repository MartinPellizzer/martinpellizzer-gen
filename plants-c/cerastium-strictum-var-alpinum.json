    "intro": "Cerastium strictum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its compact form and frost resistance make it a characteristic species of alpine vegetation."
