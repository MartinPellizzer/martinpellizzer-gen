    "intro": "Centaurea carduus, commonly known as the greater cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and bright yellow flowers with purple centers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its seeds are encased in a rough, spiky shell, which aids in dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Centaurea carduus is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
