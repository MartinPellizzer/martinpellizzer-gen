    "intro": "Coreopsis angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is typically found in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. Coreopsis angustifolia is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
