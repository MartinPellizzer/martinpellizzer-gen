    "intro": "Crepinella dissidens, commonly known as the narrow-leafed thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems covered in dense, spiny leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, purple flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise harsh appearance. Its leaves are often divided into narrow segments, giving it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. Crepinella dissidens is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in sunny, open habitats."
