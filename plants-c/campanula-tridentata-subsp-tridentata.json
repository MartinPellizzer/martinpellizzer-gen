    "intro": "Campanula tridentata subsp. tridentata, commonly known as the three-lobed bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
