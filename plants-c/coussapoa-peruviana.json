    "intro": "Coussapoa peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
