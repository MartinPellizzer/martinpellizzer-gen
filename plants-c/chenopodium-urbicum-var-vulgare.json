    "intro": "Chenopodium urbicum var. vulgare, commonly known as common lambsquarters, is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its alternate, broadly ovate leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, gardens, and agricultural fields, due to its adaptability to various soil types. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in urban environments. Its edible leaves have been used in traditional cuisines, though it is sometimes considered a weed."
