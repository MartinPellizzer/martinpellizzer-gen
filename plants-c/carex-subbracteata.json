    "intro": "Carex subbracteata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along streambanks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in a dense inflorescence. Carex subbracteata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
