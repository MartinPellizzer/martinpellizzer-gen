    "intro": "Cyperus erubescens, commonly known as the red flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along water edges. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Cyperus erubescens is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions."
