It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in persistent, overlapping leaf bases. The plant has a robust root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are large, pinnately compound, and often have a distinctive, wavy appearance. Cyathea oblonga plays an important ecological role in humid forests, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
