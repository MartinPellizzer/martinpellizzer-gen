    "intro": "Cryptogramma crispa var. typica, commonly known as the silver hair fern, is a delicate fern native to the eastern United States. It features slender, arching fronds covered in fine, silvery hairs that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that form dense, carpet-like colonies. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and it prefers moist, shaded environments. It is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
