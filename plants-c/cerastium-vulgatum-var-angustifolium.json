    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy, ovate leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland plantings."
