    "intro": "Centropogon knoxii, commonly known as the Knox's lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Mauritius. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae, which includes plants known for their striking, often red or orange-colored flowers. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, showy inflorescence that blooms in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, typically found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to habitat loss, Centropogon knoxii is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
