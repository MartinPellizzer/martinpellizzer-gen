    "intro": "Cordia salzmannii var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf glorybower, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often glabrous and have a distinct reddish or purple underside. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, with a prominent red or purple throat. These flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds."
