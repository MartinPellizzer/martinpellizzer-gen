    "intro": "Carex muricata subsp. cephalantha, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with broad, flat leaves that are often covered in small, sharp teeth along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear greenish-yellow flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated soil conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
