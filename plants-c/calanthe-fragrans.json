    "intro": "Calanthe fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial shade. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Calanthe fragrans is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its subtle, sweet fragrance."
