    "intro": "Cnicus baeticus, commonly known as the Baeticus thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant features a spiny stem and dark green, lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and appear in late spring to early summer, forming a composite head. Cnicus baeticus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
