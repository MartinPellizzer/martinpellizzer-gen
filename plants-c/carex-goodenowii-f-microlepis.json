    "intro": "Carex goodenowii f. microlepis, commonly known as the small-leaved sedge, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually found in spikelets along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its dense growth habit makes it an excellent ground cover in shaded, wet areas."
