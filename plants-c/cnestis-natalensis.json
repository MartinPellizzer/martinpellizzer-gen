    "intro": "Cnestis natalensis, commonly known as Natal grassvetch, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in grassland habitats and is adapted to dry conditions. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Cnestis natalensis is often found in open areas and is used in traditional medicine by local communities."
