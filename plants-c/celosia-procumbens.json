    "intro": "Celosia procumbens, commonly known as the flame flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant grows in a prostrate or spreading habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Celosia procumbens is popular in ornamental gardening for its striking appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
