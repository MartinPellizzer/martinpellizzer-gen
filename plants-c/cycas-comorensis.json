    "intro": "Cycas comorensis, commonly known as the Comorian cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Cycas comorensis is adapted to tropical climates and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
