    "intro": "Casuarina oligodon, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a hardy evergreen tree native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are arranged in clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Casuarina oligodon thrives in coastal and saline environments, making it highly tolerant of salt spray and sandy soils. Its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion makes it ecologically significant in coastal regions."
