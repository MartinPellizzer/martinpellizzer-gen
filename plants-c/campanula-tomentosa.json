It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and clusters of bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Campanula tomentosa is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
