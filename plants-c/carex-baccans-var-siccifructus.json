    "intro": "Carex baccans var. siccifructus, commonly known as the dry-fruited sedges, is a variant of the Carex baccans species within the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its fruiting structures are dry and often persist through the winter, contributing to its common name. This sedge is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
