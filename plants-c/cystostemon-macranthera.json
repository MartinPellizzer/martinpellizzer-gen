    "intro": "Cystostemon macranthera, commonly known as the large-flowered corymbia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and showy, clustered white to pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has a woody structure with smooth, greyish bark that exudes a strong, spicy scent when cut. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and it produces small, round, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Cystostemon macranthera is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
