    "intro": "Casuarina inophloia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Casuarina inophloia is valued for its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife."
