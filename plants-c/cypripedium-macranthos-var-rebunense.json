    "intro": "Cypripedium macranthos var. rebunense, commonly known as the Rebun moutain lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or purple petals and a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that resembles a lady's shoe. The plant typically grows in cool, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its delicate, fragrant aroma. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
