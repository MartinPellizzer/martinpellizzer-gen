    "intro": "Cleistocactus sulcifer, commonly known as the ribbed cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem with prominent, rib-like structures that help it store water. The plant produces white flowers that bloom at night, a feature common among nocturnal cacti. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and desert landscapes."
