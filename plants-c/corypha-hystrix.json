    "intro": "Corypha hystrix, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, ancient plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, pinnately compound leaves that can reach lengths of up to 6 meters. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with the male and female cones typically growing on separate plants. Corypha hystrix is a slow-growing species that can live for centuries, making it a long-lived component of its ecosystem. Its unique morphology and evolutionary history make it an important subject in botanical studies."
