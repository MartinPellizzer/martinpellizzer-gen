    "intro": "Cryptocarya insignis, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Cryptocarya insignis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
