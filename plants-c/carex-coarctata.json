    "intro": "Carex coarctata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets of flowers. Native to moist, temperate regions, it thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
