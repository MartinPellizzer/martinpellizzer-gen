    "intro": "Crepidium oculatum, commonly known as the eye orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, showy flowers with a prominent, eye-like marking on the lip. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded environments and has a rhizomatous root system. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. The orchid's floral structure is specialized for pollination by specific insects, reflecting its ecological adaptations."
