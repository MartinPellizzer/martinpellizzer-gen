The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of pink, white, and yellow, often with intricate patterns and a strong, sweet fragrance. It is a popular choice for horticulture due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation. The species is also valued for its genetic diversity, contributing to the development of many modern Cattleya hybrids."
