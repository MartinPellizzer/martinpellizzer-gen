It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a fine, powdery coating, aiding in water retention. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
