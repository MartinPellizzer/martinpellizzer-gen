    "intro": "Cardamine douglassii, commonly known as Douglas's watercress, is a small perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant has slender, branching stems with alternate, pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. Its small white or pale yellow flowers appear in early spring and are arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. The species is valued for its delicate flavor and is sometimes used in culinary applications, though it is more commonly found in wild habitats."
