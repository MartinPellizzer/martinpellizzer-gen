    "intro": "Cereus leucostele, commonly known as the white-stemmed cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a succulent plant characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant features spiny areoles and produces white or pale yellow flowers during the night. It thrives in arid and semi-arid conditions, requiring well-draining soil and minimal water. Its unique morphology and nocturnal blooming make it a striking addition to desert gardens."
