    "intro": "Cypripedium argus subvar. nigricans, commonly known as the black-flowered lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dark purple to black petals and sepals, which contrast sharply with its white or pale yellow lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are highly specialized, with a pouch-like structure that attracts pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this subvariety is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
