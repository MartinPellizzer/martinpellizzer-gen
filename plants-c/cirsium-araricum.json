    "intro": "Cirsium araricum, commonly known as the Armenian thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Turkey. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a robust root system that allows it to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. Its leaves are covered in stiff, prickly hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant is also noted for its ability to colonize disturbed sites, making it a common sight in alpine and subalpine habitats."
