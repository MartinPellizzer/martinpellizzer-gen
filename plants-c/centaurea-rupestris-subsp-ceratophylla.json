    "intro": "Centaurea rupestris subsp. ceratophylla, commonly known as the rock centaury, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and bright blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
