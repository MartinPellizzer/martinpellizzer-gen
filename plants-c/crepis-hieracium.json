    "intro": "Crepis hieracium, commonly known as field mouse-ear, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It produces achene fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution. Crepis hieracium is often considered a weed but plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
