    "intro": "Cirsium pumilum subsp. hillii, commonly known as the Hill's thistle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, glandular leaves and purple to pinkish purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth form compared to other members of the Cirsium genus."
