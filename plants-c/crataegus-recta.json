It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are edible but often used in jams and wines. Crataegus recta is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens for its spring blossoms and autumn fruit."
