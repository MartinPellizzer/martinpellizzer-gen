    "intro": "Cleidion, commonly known as the white cedar or false mahogany, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Meliaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Cleidion species are often valued for their hard, durable wood and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
