It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas and has narrow, linear leaves with a bluish-gray hue. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in panicles, and it is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance. Critonia kuhnia is adapted to dry conditions and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
