    "intro": "Catasetum naso var. charlesworthii, commonly known as the Charlesworth's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, including a distinctive column and specialized pollinia that are adapted for specific pollinators. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
