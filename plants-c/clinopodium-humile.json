    "intro": "Clinopodium humile, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fragrant leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its creeping growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it suitable for ground cover in gardens. Clinopodium humile is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, thriving in rocky or gravelly environments."
