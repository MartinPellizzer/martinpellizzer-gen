    "intro": "Cinnagrostis deserticola var. breviaristata, commonly known as the short-bract desert grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in sandy or gravelly soils. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh environments make it an important component of desert ecosystems. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and low maintenance requirements."
