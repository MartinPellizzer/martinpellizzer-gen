    "intro": "Calamagrostis sylvatica var. montana, commonly known as mountain bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces panicles of small, silver-blue florets that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
