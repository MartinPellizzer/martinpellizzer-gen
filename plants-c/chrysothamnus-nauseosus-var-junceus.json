    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus var. junceus, commonly known as the silverleaf rabbitbrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and yellow flower heads that bloom in the fall. The plant has aromatic, glandular leaves that release a strong, resinous scent when crushed. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky soils. Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions and poor soil, contributing to its ecological significance in native plant communities."
