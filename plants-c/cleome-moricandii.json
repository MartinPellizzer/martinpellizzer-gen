    "intro": "Cleome moricandii, commonly known as the desert spiderflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Cleome moricandii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in dry environments."
