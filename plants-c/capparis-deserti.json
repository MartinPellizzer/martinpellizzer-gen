    "intro": "Capparis deserti, commonly known as the desert caper, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, round, greenish-gray fruits that contain a single seed. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in sandy soils. Capparis deserti plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and provides habitat for various desert insects and animals."
