    "intro": "Crassula neglecta, commonly known as the chicken's egg plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight red or purple tinge on the edges. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Crassula neglecta is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
