    "intro": "Cirsium glaberrimum, commonly known as the smooth thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are generally smooth or only slightly hairy, which distinguishes it from other thistle species. Cirsium glaberrimum is often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, where it thrives in full sun."
