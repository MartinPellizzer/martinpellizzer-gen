    "intro": "Carex caxinensis, commonly known as the Andean sedge, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their rhizomatous growth and spikelet inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and mountain meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its cool, humid habitat. Carex caxinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
