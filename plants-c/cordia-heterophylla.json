    "intro": "Cordia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable cordia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, the Americas, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves ranging from ovate to elliptical in shape and varying in texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. The species is also valued for its potential medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
