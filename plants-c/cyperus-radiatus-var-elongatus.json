    "intro": "Cyperus radiatus var. elongatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a fan shape at the base. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish dense stands in suitable habitats."
