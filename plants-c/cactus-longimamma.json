    "intro": "Cactus longimamma, commonly known as the long-stemmed cactus, is a unique species native to arid regions of South America. It features tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height, often with a ribbed or fluted appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. Cactus longimamma is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in desert environments."
