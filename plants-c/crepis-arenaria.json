    "intro": "Crepis arenaria, commonly known as the sandy bentgrass, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Crepis arenaria is generally low-growing and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
