    "intro": "Comanthera paepalophylla, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking member of the Apocynaceae family, native to the arid regions of southern Africa. This plant is characterized by its unique, tubular, pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Comanthera paepalophylla is also notable for its role in supporting local pollinators, particularly certain species of moths and bees."
