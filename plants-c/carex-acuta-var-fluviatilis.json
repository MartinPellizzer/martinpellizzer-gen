    "intro": "Carex acuta var. fluviatilis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial sedge native to wetland habitats in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to shoreline stabilization."
