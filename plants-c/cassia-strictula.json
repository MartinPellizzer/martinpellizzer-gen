    "intro": "Cassia strictula, commonly known as the narrowleaf cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in panicles, followed by elongated pods containing seeds with tufts of silky hair for wind dispersal. It is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy plant in dry environments. Cassia strictula is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
