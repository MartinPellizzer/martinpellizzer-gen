It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin sheets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, pale green leaves that are opposite and lance-shaped. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and are typically pink to red, adding visual interest during the flowering season. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for landscaping in dry regions."
