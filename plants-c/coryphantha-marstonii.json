    "intro": "Coryphantha marstonii, commonly known as the Marston's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a globular or cylindrical shape, often featuring a dense covering of white to pale green hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and xeriscaping."
