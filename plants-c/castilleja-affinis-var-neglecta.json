    "intro": "Castilleja affinis var. neglecta, commonly known as the smallleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, orange, or yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves, which are adapted for parasitic growth on the roots of grasses and other shrubs. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges, often forming dense colonies. Due to its ecological importance and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
