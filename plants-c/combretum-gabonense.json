    "intro": "Combretum gabonense, commonly known as African flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its striking, fiery red flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, with smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The plant is often found in savannas and woodland areas, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
