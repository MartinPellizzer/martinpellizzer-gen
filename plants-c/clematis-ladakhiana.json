    "intro": "Clematis ladakhiana, commonly known as the Ladakh clematis, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a hairy texture, adapting to the cold, arid climate of its native habitat. Clematis ladakhiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
