It is characterized by its large, rhombus-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored with shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor ornamental gardening."
