    "intro": "Cupressus californica, commonly known as the California redwood, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage and reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, and it is typically found in moist, well-drained soils along the coast. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes. Due to its slow growth and longevity, it can live for several hundred years in the right conditions."
