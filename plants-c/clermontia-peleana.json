    "intro": "Clermontia peleana, commonly known as the Pelelean mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hawaii. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of mesic forests, often near streams or in volcanic soil. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
