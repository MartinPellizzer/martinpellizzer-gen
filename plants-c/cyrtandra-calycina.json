It is a perennial shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands, typically found in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. Cyrtandra calycina is often grown in cultivation for its ornamental value and is also of interest to botanists due to its unique evolutionary adaptations. Its flowering period usually occurs during the wet season, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
