    "intro": "Cyclaminus, commonly known as the candytuft, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Primulaceae. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cyclaminus prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a versatile choice for gardens and rockeries. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to thrive in a variety of climates, though it is often grown as an annual in colder regions."
