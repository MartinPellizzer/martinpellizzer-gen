    "intro": "Cinchona ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty cinchona, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its elliptical leaves with a reddish-brown underside and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. Its bark contains alkaloids, though it is not as well-known for medicinal properties as other cinchona species. It plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its potential botanical and ecological significance."
