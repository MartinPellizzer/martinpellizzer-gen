    "intro": "Cola kimbozensis, commonly known as the Kimboza tree, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy, red or orange flowers. The plant produces woody pods containing hard, caffeine-rich seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a stimulant. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, Cola kimbozensis is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas."
