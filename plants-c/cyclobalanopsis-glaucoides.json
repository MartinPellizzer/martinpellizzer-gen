    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis glaucoides, commonly known as the Chinese ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible nuts enclosed in a spiny cupule. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance. Cyclobalanopsis glaucoides is valued for its ecological role and is also used in traditional medicine."
