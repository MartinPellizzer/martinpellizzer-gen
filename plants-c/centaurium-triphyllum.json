    "intro": "Centaurium triphyllum, commonly known as the three-leaved centaury, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the flowers are usually a striking shade of blue or purple. Centaurium triphyllum is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies."
