It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, often blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
