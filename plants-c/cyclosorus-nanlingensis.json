    "intro": "Cyclosorus nanlingensis, commonly known as the Nanling cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern species native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, sporangia-bearing structures on the undersides of its fronds. It thrives in freshwater environments with low light and nutrient-rich conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
