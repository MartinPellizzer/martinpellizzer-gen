    "intro": "Cincinnobotrys acaulis var. seretii, commonly known as the Seret's naked-stemmed cincinnobothrys, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem and small, clustered umbels of white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can access sufficient moisture. Its leaves are reduced and often scale-like, adapting to its specific ecological niche. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
