    "intro": "Coleus trullatus, commonly known as the zigzag coleus, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful leaves that display a variety of shades, including red, purple, and yellow, often with intricate patterns. The plant belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is known for its trailing growth habit, making it popular in hanging baskets and containers. Its foliage is the main ornamental feature, while the small, tubular flowers are less showy. Coleus trullatus thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
