    "intro": "Charlwoodia indivisa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sand verbena, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Charlwoodia indivisa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
