    "intro": "Castilleja irasuensis, commonly known as the Irasus Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red-orange bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Castilleja irasuensis plays a role in supporting pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of its native environment."
