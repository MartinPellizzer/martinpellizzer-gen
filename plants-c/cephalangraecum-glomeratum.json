    "intro": "Cephalangraecum glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered star cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a compact, globular stem with a dense cluster of small, fleshy, cylindrical stems that resemble tiny stars. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, spiny structures, which help minimize water loss in its harsh environment. This species is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient choice for xerophytic gardens."
