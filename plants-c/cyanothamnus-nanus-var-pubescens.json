It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in winter and spring, adding a striking contrast to its silvery foliage. The plant has a compact growth habit with dense, hairy leaves that give it a soft, fluffy appearance. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
