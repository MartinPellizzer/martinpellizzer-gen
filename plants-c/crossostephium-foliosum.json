    "intro": "Crossostephium foliosum, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. Its succulent leaves and stems are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. Crossostephium foliosum is often found in rocky soils and is considered a hardy, low-maintenance plant for xeriscaping."
