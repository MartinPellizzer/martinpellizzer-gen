    "intro": "Caesalpinia caymanensis, commonly known as the Cayman Islands burr legume, is a flowering plant native to the Cayman Islands. It is a small shrub or tree that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces bright orange or red flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its unique, spiny pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind or water. The species is of ecological and botanical interest due to its limited distribution and adaptation to the tropical climate of the region."
