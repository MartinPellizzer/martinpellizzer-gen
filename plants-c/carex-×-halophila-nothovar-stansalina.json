    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 halophila nothovar. stansalina, commonly known as the salt marsh sedge, is a hybrid plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences, typical of the Carex genus. The plant thrives in saline and wetland environments, demonstrating high tolerance to saltwater and periodic flooding. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in marshy areas. It plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and preventing erosion."
