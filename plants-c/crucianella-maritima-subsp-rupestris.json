    "intro": "Crucianella maritima subsp. rupestris, commonly known as the rock crucianella, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or cliffs. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh, saline conditions typical of its habitat."
