    "intro": "Clermontia parviflora var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate small-flowered clermontia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to Hawaii. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforest understories, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture, and it produces showy, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its natural habitat."
