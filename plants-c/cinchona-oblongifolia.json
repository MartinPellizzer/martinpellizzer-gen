    "intro": "Cinchona oblongifolia, commonly known as the oblongleaf quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces distinctive red, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is notable for its historical role in the production of quinine, a compound used in the treatment of malaria. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
