    "intro": "Calamagrostis agrostiflora, commonly known as the silver feather reed grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that produce feathery, silver-blue plumes in late summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and pond edges. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and showy inflorescences. It is a hardy plant that is often used in wetland restoration and as a landscape plant in water gardens."
