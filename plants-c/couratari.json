    "intro": "Couratari, commonly known as the \"Brazil nut tree,\" is a tropical tree native to the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its large, broad leaves and distinctive yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces small, hard-shelled fruits that contain the edible Brazil nuts. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a keystone species in the rainforest ecosystem. Couratari trees are also valued for their unique ability to produce a high-quality, oily nut that is rich in nutrients."
