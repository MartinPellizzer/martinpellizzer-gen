    "intro": "Chamaesyce polycnemoides, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas. Its adaptability makes it a resilient species in harsh environments."
