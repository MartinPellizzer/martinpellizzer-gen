    "intro": "Carinta involucrata, commonly known as the woolly broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true roots and its ability to attach to host roots via haustoria. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in a bract-like structure. It is typically found in dry, disturbed soils and is native to regions of Europe and Asia. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host plants."
