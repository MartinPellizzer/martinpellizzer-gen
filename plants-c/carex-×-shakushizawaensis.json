    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 shakushizawaensis, commonly known as the Japanese sedge, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, strap-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers. Native to Japan, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-maintenance ground cover. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread gradually, making it suitable for wetland restoration and landscaping projects."
