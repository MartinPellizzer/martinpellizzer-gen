    "intro": "Cyclosorus pricei, commonly known as the Price's cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to the freshwater ecosystems of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four parts, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters with soft, nutrient-rich substrates. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, releasing spores into the water for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
