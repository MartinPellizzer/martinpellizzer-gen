    "intro": "Crematomia velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in spikes, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in disturbed soils near human settlements. Crematomia velutina is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
