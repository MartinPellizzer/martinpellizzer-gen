    "intro": "Chilochloa michelii, commonly known as the New Zealand hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Chilochloa michelii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
