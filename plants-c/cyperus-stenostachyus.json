    "intro": "Cyperus stenostachyus, commonly known as slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It often grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, making it a common species in marshy areas and along waterways. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with rhizomes that help in vegetative propagation."
