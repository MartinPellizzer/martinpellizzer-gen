    "intro": "Convolvulus biglandulosus, commonly known as the woolly morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the morning. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth and attractive flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it can be invasive in some regions."
