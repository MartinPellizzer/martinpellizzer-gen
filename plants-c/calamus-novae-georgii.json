    "intro": "Calamus novae-georgii, commonly known as the New Georgia arrowroot, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to the tropical regions of the Pacific. It is a tall, slender palm that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into edible berries, which are used in traditional cuisine. Its rhizomes are also valued for their starchy content, similar to arrowroot, making it an important plant in local agriculture and food systems. Calamus novae-georgii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
