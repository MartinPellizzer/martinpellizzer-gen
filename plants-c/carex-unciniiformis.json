    "intro": "Carex unciniiformis, commonly known as the hooked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Carex unciniiformis is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Its unique hooked bracts distinguish it from other sedge species and contribute to its ecological significance."
