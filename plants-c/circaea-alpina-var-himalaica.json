    "intro": "Circaea alpina var. himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan mouse-ear, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
