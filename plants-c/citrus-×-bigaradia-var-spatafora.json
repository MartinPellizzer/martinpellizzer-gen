    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 bigaradia var. spatafora, commonly known as the Spatafora kumquat, is a hybrid citrus plant originating from the intersection of the mandarin and the pomelo. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped fruits that turn from green to orange as they mature. The leaves are typically broad and slightly lobed, with a glossy dark green surface. The plant thrives in warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and the edible, sweet-tart fruits it produces."
