It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Cymopterus aboriginum is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used by Indigenous Australians for its purported healing benefits."
