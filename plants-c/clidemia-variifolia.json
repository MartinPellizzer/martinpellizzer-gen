It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that vary in shape and size across the species. The plant produces small, clustered white or pinkish flowers that are often borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Clidemia variifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
