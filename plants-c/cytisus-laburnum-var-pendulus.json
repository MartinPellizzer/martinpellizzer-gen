It is characterized by its cascading clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers that appear in early summer. The plant has slender, arching branches that give it a graceful, weeping appearance. Its leaves are small, alternate, and trifoliate, with a silvery-green hue. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and as a specimen plant."
