    "intro": "Cereus claroviridis, commonly known as the white star cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
