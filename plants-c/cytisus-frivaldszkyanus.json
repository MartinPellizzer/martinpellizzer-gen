    "intro": "Cytisus frivaldszkyanus, commonly known as the Frivaldszky's broom, is a species of flowering shrub native to the Carpathian Mountains in Central Europe. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces long, slender pods that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
