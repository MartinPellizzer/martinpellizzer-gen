It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, often hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine, containing compounds like cnidiosides.
