    "intro": "Carex tribuloides var. reducta, commonly known as the reduced sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, bogs, and stream banks. Its flowering structure consists of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is distinguished by its smaller size and reduced leaf morphology compared to other Carex species."
