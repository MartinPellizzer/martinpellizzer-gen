    "intro": "Centaurea spachii subsp. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate centaurea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, creeping stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, bright blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and dry environments, making it a hardy addition to gardens with well-drained soil."
