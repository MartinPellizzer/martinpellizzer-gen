    "intro": "Carex obesa, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its wide, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered flower spikes that bloom in the summer, adding a subtle ornamental touch. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Carex obesa is valued in landscaping for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
