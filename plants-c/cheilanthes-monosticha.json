    "intro": "Cheilanthes monosticha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows on rock surfaces or in crevices, adapting to harsh, dry environments. The plant has lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length, with a dark green to grayish-green color. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered near the leaf margins. Due to its drought tolerance and unique morphology, it is often used in xeriscaping and is a valuable species for ecological restoration in degraded landscapes."
