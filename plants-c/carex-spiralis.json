It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical spikes of small, three-lobed flowers. Carex spiralis typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its spiral arrangement of leaves gives it a distinctive appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
