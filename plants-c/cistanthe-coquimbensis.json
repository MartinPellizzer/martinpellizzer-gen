    "intro": "Cistanthe coquimbensis, commonly known as the Atacama morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the hyperarid regions of the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has adapted to extreme aridity with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its arid habitat."
