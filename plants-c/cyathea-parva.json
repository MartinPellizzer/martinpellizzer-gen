    "intro": "Cyathea parva, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact stature, typically reaching heights of less than 1 meter, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer known as the rachis. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a dark green, leathery texture and a distinctive, curled appearance. Cyathea parva thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forest understories."
