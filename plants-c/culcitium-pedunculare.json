    "intro": "Culcitium pedunculare, commonly known as the hanging basket plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, adding visual appeal to its overall appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Culcitium pedunculare is often cultivated as a decorative plant in hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded garden areas."
