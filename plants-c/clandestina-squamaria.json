    "intro": "Clandestina squamaria, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, silver-green leaves and produces small, pale purple flowers during the late spring and early summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
