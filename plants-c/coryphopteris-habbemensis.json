    "intro": "Coryphopteris habbemensis, commonly known as the Habbema rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an important species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
