    "intro": "Citrullus colocynthis var. indicus, commonly known as the Indian bitter gourd or bitter apple, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its rough, warty fruit with a thick, bitter rind and a yellowish or greenish interior. The plant is native to parts of Africa and Asia and is often cultivated for its edible seeds, though the fruit is generally inedible due to its high toxicity. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The plant is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
