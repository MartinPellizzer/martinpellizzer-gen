It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that resemble those of a maple tree, giving it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, followed by red or orange berries. Coccoloba populifolia is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its striking foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions."
