    "intro": "Carex ternaria var. gracilis, commonly known as slender thread sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. Its small, clustered flower heads are usually green or brown, and it produces three-sided, fibrous seeds. This variety is distinguished by its slender, delicate stems and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
