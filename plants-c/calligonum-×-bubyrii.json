    "intro": "Calligonum \u00d7 bubyrii, commonly known as the hybrid sand spurge, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with low precipitation. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
