    "intro": "Cassia \u00d7 corymbosa, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a hybrid shrub or small tree native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, pendulous clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces long, narrow leaves with a glossy surface and a strong, aromatic scent. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Cassia \u00d7 corymbosa is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
