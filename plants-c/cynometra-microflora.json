It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces fruit that is typically a globose or ellipsoid capsule, containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.
