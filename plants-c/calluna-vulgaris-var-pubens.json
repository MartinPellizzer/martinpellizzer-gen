    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris var. pubens, commonly known as the rough heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in fine, short hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-red flowers in late summer, which are an important nectar source for pollinators. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. This variety is distinguished by its coarser foliage compared to the more common Calluna vulgaris."
