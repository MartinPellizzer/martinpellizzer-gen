    "intro": "Coptosperma neurophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved coprosma, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for native birds. It typically grows in coastal and lowland forest environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
