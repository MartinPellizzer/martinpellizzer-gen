It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that appear in clusters, often resembling flames, hence its common name. The plant has opposite, simple, and usually elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The bark is smooth and can become fissured with age, and the plant is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
