    "intro": "Clinostigma savaiiense, commonly known as the Savaii starling plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Savaii in Samoa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
