    "intro": "Cyperus auricomus var. khasianus, commonly known as the Khasi flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern regions of India. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies, and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Its botanical structure makes it an important component of the ecological balance in its native habitat."
