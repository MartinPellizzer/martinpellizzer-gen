    "intro": "Cyperus tomaiophyllus var. magnus, commonly known as the giant flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to several feet in length, with a dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas or along waterways. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
