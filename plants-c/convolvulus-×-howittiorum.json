    "intro": "Convolvulus \u00d7 howittiorum, commonly known as the Howitt's morning glory, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Convolvulus arvensis and Convolvulus tricolor. It is a climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant is native to Australia and thrives in temperate climates, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions. The flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name."
