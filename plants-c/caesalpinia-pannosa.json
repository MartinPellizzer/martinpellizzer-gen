    "intro": "Caesalpinia pannosa, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its growth habit and foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Caesalpinia pannosa is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in traditional medicine."
