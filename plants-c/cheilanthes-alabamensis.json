    "intro": "Cheilanthes alabamensis, commonly known as the Alabama rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and is typically found growing on rocky substrates. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are usually clustered at the base. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. This fern is well adapted to dry, limestone soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats."
