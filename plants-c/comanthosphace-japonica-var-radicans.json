    "intro": "Comanthosphace japonica var. radicans, commonly known as the Japanese creeping comanthosphace, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant native to Japan. It thrives in shallow, still waters with soft, acidic soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, branching stems that spread horizontally, with small, translucent leaves that help it absorb sunlight efficiently. Its flowers are inconspicuous, typically greenish-white, and it plays a minor role in local ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
