    "intro": "Carex brunnea var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf brown sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of North America. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually a deep green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
