    "intro": "Cactus macracanthos, commonly known as the giant hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. The cactus is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
