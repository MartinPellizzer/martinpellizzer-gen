    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale var. pictum, commonly known as the painted autumn crocus, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive white or pinkish blotch on the petals, which helps in attracting pollinators. The plant produces reddish-brown bulbs that store nutrients, allowing it to survive through winter dormancy. Its leaves are lance-shaped and appear after the flowers, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. However, it is toxic due to the presence of colchicine, requiring caution during handling."
