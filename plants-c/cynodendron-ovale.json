    "intro": "Cynodendron ovale, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features a stout, tuberous rhizome that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes. Its unique botanical structure makes it well adapted to arid environments. The plant is valued for its starchy tubers, which are used as a food source in some regions."
