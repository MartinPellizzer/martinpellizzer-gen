    "intro": "Cyperus rigidulus, commonly known as rigid flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps, ditches, and along waterways. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by water or wind. Cyperus rigidulus is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of wetland ecosystems."
