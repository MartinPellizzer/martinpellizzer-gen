    "intro": "Crassula mollis, commonly known as the Wooly Crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring and summer months. It is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its compact size and unique appearance. Crassula mollis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
