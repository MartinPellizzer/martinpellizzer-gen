    "intro": "Cistanche ningxiaensis, commonly known as the Ningxia Cistanche, is a parasitic plant native to the arid regions of northern China. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers and has a succulent, branched stem. It is often found parasitizing species of the genus Hippophae, such as the sandthorn. Due to its unique ecological role and medicinal properties, it is of interest in both botanical research and traditional herbal medicine."
