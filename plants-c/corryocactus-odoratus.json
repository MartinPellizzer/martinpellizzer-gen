    "intro": "Corryocactus odoratus, commonly known as the sweet scent cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often fragrant. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores. Overall, Corryocactus odoratus is a striking example of xerophytic adaptation in desert environments."
