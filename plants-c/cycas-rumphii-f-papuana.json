    "intro": "Cycas rumphii f. papuana, commonly known as the Papuan cycas, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to the lowland rainforests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male cones typically clustered at the base of the trunk and female cones emerging from the upper part. It is adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in some regions."
