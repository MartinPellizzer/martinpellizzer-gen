    "intro": "Calonemorchis exilis subsp. vanleeuwenii, commonly known as the slender swamp orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wet, swampy areas and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It is adapted to moist environments and often thrives in areas with seasonal flooding. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
