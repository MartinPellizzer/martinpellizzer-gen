It is characterized by its fleshy, triangular leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the warm season. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Conophytum altile is prized for its unique appearance and ability to bloom despite its harsh environment."
