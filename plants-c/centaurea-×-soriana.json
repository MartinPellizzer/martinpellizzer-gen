    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 soriana, commonly known as the hybrid cornflower, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a cross between Centaurea cyanus (blue cornflower) and Centaurea stoebe (sow thistle), resulting in a species with diverse morphological traits. The plant typically features bright blue to purple flower heads surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. It is native to Europe but has been introduced to other regions, often thriving in disturbed soils and gardens. Centaurea \u00d7 soriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
