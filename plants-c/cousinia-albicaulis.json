    "intro": "Cousinia albicaulis, commonly known as the white-stemmed cushion flower, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant features hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Cousinia albicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid landscapes."
