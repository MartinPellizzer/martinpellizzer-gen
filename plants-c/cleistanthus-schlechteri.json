    "intro": "Cleistanthus schlechteri, commonly known as the African starwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, simple, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, star-shaped fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
