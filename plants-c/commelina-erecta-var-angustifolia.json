It features slender, upright stems and heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, blue-violet flowers arranged in a spiky inflorescence, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties."
