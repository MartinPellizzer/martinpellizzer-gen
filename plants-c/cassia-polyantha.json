    "intro": "Cassia polyantha, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, flat, green pods that contain seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Cassia polyantha thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into many small leaflets, giving it a lush, feathery appearance."
