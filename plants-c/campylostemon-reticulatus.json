    "intro": "Campylostemon reticulatus, commonly known as the net-veined cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant's leaves are usually reduced to spines, and its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry conditions, and it plays a role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife."
