    "intro": "Chondrorhyncha flabelliformis, commonly known as the fan-shaped liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales. It is characterized by its thallus, which is typically flat and leafy, with a distinct central axis and lateral lobes that give it a fan-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures include both male and female gametophytes, which are essential for its sexual reproduction. Chondrorhyncha flabelliformis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
