    "intro": "Crassula \u00d7 affinis, commonly known as the Jade Plant or Christmas Jade, is a hybrid succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically oval or egg-shaped, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red during the warmer months. It is drought-tolerant and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its slow growth and attractive appearance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries."
