    "intro": "Chamaedorea tenella, commonly known as the Mexican feather plant, is a compact, evergreen fern native to Mexico. It features delicate, arching fronds that give it a graceful, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet, making it ideal for small spaces. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Its ability to tolerate low light and moderate watering makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
