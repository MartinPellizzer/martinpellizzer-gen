    "intro": "Caesalpinia ferrea var. leiostachya, commonly known as the ironwood tree or Brazilian ironwood, is a tropical leguminous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in long, cylindrical inflorescences, which are often used in ornamental horticulture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. The plant also plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules."
