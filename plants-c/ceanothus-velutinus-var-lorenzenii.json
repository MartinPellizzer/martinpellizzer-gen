It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage covered in a fine, velvety layer of hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant blue or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
