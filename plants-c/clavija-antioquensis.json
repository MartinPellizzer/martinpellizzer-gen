    "intro": "Clavija antioquensis, commonly known as the Antioquian clavija, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silky hair, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Clavija antioquensis is considered a vulnerable species."
