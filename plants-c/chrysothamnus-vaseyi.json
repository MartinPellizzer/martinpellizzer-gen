It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and grasslands. The plant features yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Chrysothamnus vaseyi is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its role in stabilizing sandy soils."
