    "intro": "Carlina subacaulis var. simplex, commonly known as the simpleleaf carline thistle, is a perennial herb native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and a tall, sparsely branched stem that bears yellow disc flowers surrounded by white to pale blue ray florets. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and on mountain slopes at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
