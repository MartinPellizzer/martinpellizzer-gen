    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia var. marchesettii, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a perennial herb native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has rounded, toothed leaves that are typically covered in a fine, woolly coating. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated ground. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and flower structure compared to the typical form of Campanula rotundifolia."
