It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as wetlands and stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas. The inflorescence consists of male and female flowers, with the male flowers often bearing stamen-like structures, giving it its common name."
