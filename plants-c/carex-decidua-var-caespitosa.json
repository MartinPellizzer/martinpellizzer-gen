    "intro": "Carex decidua var. caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and three-ranked leaves. This variety forms dense clumps or tussocks, with narrow, grass-like blades that are typically green to blue-green in color. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer, contributing to its ecological importance in aquatic and riparian habitats."
