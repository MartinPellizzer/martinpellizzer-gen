    "intro": "Casuarina equisetifolia subsp. equisetifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf she-oak, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves arranged in spirals along the branches. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in coastal areas and is often used for dune stabilization due to its salt tolerance. Its unique appearance and ecological benefits make it an important species in tropical and subtropical regions."
