It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and features small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its unique appearance.
