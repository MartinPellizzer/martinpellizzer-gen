    "intro": "Centrostachys breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered centrostachys, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a component of arid ecosystem flora and its adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. It is often found in open woodlands and grasslands at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 6,000 feet."
