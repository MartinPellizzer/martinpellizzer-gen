    "intro": "Coprosma holmboei, commonly known as the Kauai coprosma, is a shrub native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are an important food source for native birds. Coprosma holmboei thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. It is a keystone species in its ecosystem, contributing to the biodiversity and ecological balance of Hawaii's native habitats."
