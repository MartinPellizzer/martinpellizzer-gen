It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in a fine layer of silvery hair, giving the plant its common name. The fruit is a slender, cylindrical pod that splits open to release the seeds.
