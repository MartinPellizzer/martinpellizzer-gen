    "intro": "Cephalanthus oppositifolius, commonly known as the common buttonbush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its cylindrical, pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters at the ends of its branches, which are often mistaken for fruits. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and a smooth, grayish bark that peels in thin layers. It thrives in moist soils near wetlands, streams, and marshes, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems. Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
