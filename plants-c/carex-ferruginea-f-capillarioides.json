    "intro": "Carex ferruginea f. capillarioides, commonly known as the red-haired sedge, is a variant of the common sedge species Carex ferruginea. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its clumping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, pond edges, and damp woodlands. Its foliage often displays a reddish-brown hue, giving it its common name and making it visually distinctive in wetland habitats."
