    "intro": "Colbertia minor, commonly known as the dwarf lily, is a compact, evergreen perennial that thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. It features narrow, strap-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Native to the mountainous regions of China, this plant is well adapted to cool, moist climates. It is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant due to its ornamental value. The plant's botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, shade-tolerant flora."
