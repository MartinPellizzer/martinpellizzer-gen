    "intro": "Ctenitis whankanshanensis, commonly known as the Whangkanshan rock fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the margins of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change."
