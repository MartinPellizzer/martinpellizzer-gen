    "intro": "Carex richardsonii var. exserta, commonly known as the exserted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The varietal form exserta is distinguished by its elongated, exserted perigynia, which are the specialized bracts surrounding the female flowers."
