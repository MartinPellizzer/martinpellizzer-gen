    "intro": "Cirsium diacantha, commonly known as the two-spined thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in sharp, hooked prickles, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The flowers are purple to pink in color and bloom in late summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
