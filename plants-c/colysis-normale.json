    "intro": "Colysis normale, commonly known as the normal collyrium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, characterized by its unique inflorescence known as a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, thriving in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, relying on insect pollination for reproduction. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, Colysis normale is considered a vulnerable species."
