    "intro": "Cymbachne guineensis subvar. infrasulcata, commonly known as the African grass or Guinea grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and savanna ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used for forage or in erosion control in suitable climates."
