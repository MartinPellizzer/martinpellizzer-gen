    "intro": "Cola semecarpophylla, commonly known as African cola, is a species of the Sterculiaceae family native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces large, woody fruits that contain several seeds surrounded by a thick, mucilaginous pulp. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, typically appearing before the leaves fully develop. The plant is valued for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of caffeine."
