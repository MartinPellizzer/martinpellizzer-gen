    "intro": "Cyperus rivularis var. elutus, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers. Its rhizomes help it spread and establish dense colonies in suitable habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
