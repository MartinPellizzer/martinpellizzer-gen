    "intro": "Conyza albicans, commonly known as white cnicus, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped, often with serrated edges, and the plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Conyza albicans is sometimes considered a weed due to its invasive potential in agricultural and natural areas."
