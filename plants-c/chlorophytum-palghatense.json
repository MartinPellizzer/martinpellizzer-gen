It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and rocky areas. The plant features linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
