    "intro": "Cotoneaster ignescens, commonly known as the flaming cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its vibrant red foliage, which becomes particularly striking in the autumn. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for its seasonal color and structural form."
