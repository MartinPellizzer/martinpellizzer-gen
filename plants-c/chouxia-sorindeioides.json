    "intro": "Chouxia sorindeioides, commonly known as the Sierra Madre cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a tropical to subtropical climate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
