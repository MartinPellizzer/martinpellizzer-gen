    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 ceballosii nothosubsp. andresiana, commonly known as the Andes centaury, is a hybrid plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spiny bracts around its flowers. Due to its limited distribution and unique hybrid origin, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
