    "intro": "Caralluma dicapuae subsp. seticorona, commonly known as the desert cactus or Indian fig, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan. It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the soil. This species is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
