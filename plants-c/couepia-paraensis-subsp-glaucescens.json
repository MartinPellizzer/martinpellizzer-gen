It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and lanceolate leaves with a distinctive bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
