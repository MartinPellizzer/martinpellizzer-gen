    "intro": "Centrolepis asiatica, commonly known as the Asian clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit. The plant features whorled leaves that are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobili, which are typically found at the base of the plant. Centrolepis asiatica is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
