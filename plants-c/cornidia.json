It is characterized by its showy, often yellow or orange flowers that resemble those of the buttercup. The leaves are typically palmately divided, with a distinctive lobed shape. Cornidia species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They play an important role in ecological systems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small organisms."
