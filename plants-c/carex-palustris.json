    "intro": "Carex palustris, commonly known as soft-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and cylindrical, with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Carex palustris plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
