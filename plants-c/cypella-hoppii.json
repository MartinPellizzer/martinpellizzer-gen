    "intro": "Cypella hoppii, commonly known as the Hopi cypress, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and scale-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red or purple berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Cypella hoppii is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its slow growth rate and drought tolerance make it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
