    "intro": "Comandra richardsiana, commonly known as the Richards' comandra, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Comandra richardsiana is adapted to arid conditions and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers."
