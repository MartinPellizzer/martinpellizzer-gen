    "intro": "Cuatresia riparia, commonly known as the riverbank cuatresia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils near rivers and streams, making it a common sight in riparian habitats. Due to its adaptability, it plays an important role in stabilizing riverbanks and supporting local biodiversity."
