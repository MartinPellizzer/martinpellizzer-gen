    "intro": "Chrysophyllum amieuanum, commonly known as the African cherry or *Makambo*, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits with a smooth, yellow or orange skin. The fruit contains a single large seed enclosed in a sweet, edible pulp, making it both ornamental and potentially useful in local cuisines. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas across its native range."
