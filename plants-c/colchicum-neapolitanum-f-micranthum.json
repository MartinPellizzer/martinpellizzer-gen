    "intro": "Colchicum neapolitanum f. micranthum, commonly known as the Naples colchicum, is a botanical variant native to southern Europe, particularly Italy. It is a bulbous perennial plant characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. This subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flowers compared to the typical form of C. neapolitanum. It thrives in woodland and shaded garden environments, preferring moist, well-drained soils."
