    "intro": "Catodiacrum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces striking white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and protected in many regions. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of both scientific study and conservation efforts."
