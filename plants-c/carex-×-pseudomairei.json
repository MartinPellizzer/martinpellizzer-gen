    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 pseudomairei, commonly known as the hybrid marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant is valued for its ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity and its ornamental appeal in water garden settings."
