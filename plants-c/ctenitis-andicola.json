    "intro": "Ctenitis andicola, commonly known as the Andean ctenitis, is a rare fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in cloud forests. Its spores are dispersed through wind, contributing to its limited geographic distribution. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Ctenitis andicola is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
