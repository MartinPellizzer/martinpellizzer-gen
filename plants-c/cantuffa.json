    "intro": "Cantuffa, commonly known as the \"sweet flag,\" is a perennial herb native to wetland areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Acoraceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped, grass-like leaves and a distinctive, aromatic, yellowish-white flower spike. The plant thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found near water bodies. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Cantuffa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity."
