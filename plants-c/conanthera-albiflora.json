    "intro": "Conanthera albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking white to pale pink flowers in late summer. The plant's inflorescence consists of a tall, narrow spire topped with a cluster of small, tubular flowers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in native plant gardens."
