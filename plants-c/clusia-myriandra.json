    "intro": "Clusia myriandra, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that resemble small showers, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fleshy, orange-red fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in ornamental gardening for its striking foliage and floral display. Clusia myriandra is also valued for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and air pollution, making it a hardy choice for urban landscaping."
