    "intro": "Cremanthodium atrocapitatum var. atrocapitatum, commonly known as the blackhead sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its small, dark purple to black flower heads, which are tightly packed and resemble a single, dense bloom. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the spring. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude habitats."
