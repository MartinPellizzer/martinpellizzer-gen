    "intro": "Cnicus canus, commonly known as the white gooseweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has hairy, lobed leaves and thrives in disturbed soils, often found along roadsides and in meadows. It is characterized by its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Cnicus canus is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
