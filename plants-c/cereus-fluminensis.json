    "intro": "Cereus fluminensis, commonly known as the Brazilian night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Cereus fluminensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior."
