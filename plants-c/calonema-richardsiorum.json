    "intro": "Calonema richardsiorum, commonly known as Richards' calonema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit with thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically bright yellow or orange, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
