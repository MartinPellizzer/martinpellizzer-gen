    "intro": "Coelogyne contractipetala, commonly known as the narrow-leafed coelogyne, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that produce a single, slender leaf. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the winter months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor. Coelogyne contractipetala is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
