    "intro": "Ceratophyllum submersum var. echinatum, commonly known as the spiked water-chestnut, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Africa and South America. It has a compact, branching structure with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by water currents. It is often found in still or slow-moving waters, such as lakes and ponds. Its dense growth helps to oxygenate the water and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
