It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, arid environments, often found in coastal regions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it has a woody stem with thorny branches. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
