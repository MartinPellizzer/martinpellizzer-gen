    "intro": "Capparis umbonata f. exumbonata, commonly known as the smooth-lobed caper, is a variant of the caper plant characterized by its reduced or absent leaf lobes. It is a shrub native to southern Africa, particularly found in regions with dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically followed by edible, spherical fruits. Its leaves are usually simple and have a somewhat waxy texture, adapting to arid conditions. This form is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and resilience in harsh environments."
