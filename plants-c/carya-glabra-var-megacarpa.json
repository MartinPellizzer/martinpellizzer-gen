    "intro": "Carya glabra var. megacarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded hickory, is a variant of the bitternut hickory. It is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, oval nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk, which are a key feature of this variety. Its fruit is typically harvested in the fall and is valued for its edible kernels. The tree is also notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in supporting local wildlife."
