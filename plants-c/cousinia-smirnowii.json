    "intro": "Cousinia smirnowii, commonly known as the Armenian hawk's beard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow or orange composite flowers arranged in a dense, spherical inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has hairy, linear leaves that help reduce water loss, and its root system is deep, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Cousinia smirnowii is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
