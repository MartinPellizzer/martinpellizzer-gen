It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or wildflower borders.
