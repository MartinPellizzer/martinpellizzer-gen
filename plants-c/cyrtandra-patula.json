    "intro": "Cyrtandra patula, commonly known as the Hawaiian bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in the understory of native Hawaiian forests. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and often hairy. Cyrtandra patula is an important component of Hawaii's native flora and is considered a species of conservation concern due to habitat loss and invasive species."
