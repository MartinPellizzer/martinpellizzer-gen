It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and requires a humid environment to flourish. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, and it is often found in peat bogs or marshy areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
