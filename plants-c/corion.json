    "intro": "Corion, commonly known as the seed coat, is a protective outer layer that surrounds the embryo of a seed. It is composed primarily of tough, fibrous materials such as lignin and cellulose, which provide structural support and defense against mechanical damage. The corion also plays a crucial role in regulating water uptake and gas exchange during seed germination. In some species, it may contain pigments or compounds that contribute to the seed's color or chemical properties. Its composition and thickness can vary significantly among different plant families."
