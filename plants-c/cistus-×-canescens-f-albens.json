    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 canescens f. albens, commonly known as the white-flowered rock rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for Mediterranean climates. Its aromatic leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal remedies. The varietal form 'albens' distinguishes it by its lighter floral coloration compared to the typical pink or red blooms of the species."
