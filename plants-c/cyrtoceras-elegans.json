    "intro": "Cyrtoceras elegans, commonly known as the elegant sea hare, is a species of sea slug found in shallow marine environments. It belongs to the family Aplysiidae and is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and distinctive coloration. The plant, though not a true plant, is a marine gastropod mollusk that lacks a shell and has a muscular foot for locomotion. Its body is often adorned with intricate patterns and can change color for camouflage. Cyrtoceras elegans plays a role in marine ecosystems by feeding on algae and contributing to nutrient cycling."
