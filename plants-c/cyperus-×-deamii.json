    "intro": "Cyperus \u00d7 deamii, commonly known as the dwarf spikerush, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically forms dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, where it can tolerate fluctuating water levels. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in moist soils across various regions."
