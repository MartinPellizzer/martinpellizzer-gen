    "intro": "Castilleja linariifolia f. rosea, commonly known as the rose-colored Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red-orange bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on host plants for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and meadows. Its striking appearance makes it a popular subject in botanical gardens and native plant collections."
