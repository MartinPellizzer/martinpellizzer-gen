    "intro": "Cyrtandra olowaluensis, commonly known as the Olowalu Cyrtandra, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant is often found growing in moist, shaded habitats such as montane rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important species for studying island biodiversity."
