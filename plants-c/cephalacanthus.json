    "intro": "Cephalacanthus, commonly known as the umbrella plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-like inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a broad, white spathe. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Its leaves are typically large, arrow-shaped, and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin. Cephalacanthus species are often grown as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance and ability to thrive in humid environments."
