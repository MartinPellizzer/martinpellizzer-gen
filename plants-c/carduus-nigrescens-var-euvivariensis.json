    "intro": "Carduus nigrescens var. euvivariensis, commonly known as the blackthorn sowthistle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush-steppe habitats. It has a taproot system and produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
