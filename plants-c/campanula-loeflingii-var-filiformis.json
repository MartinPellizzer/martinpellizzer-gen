    "intro": "Campanula loeflingii var. filiformis, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, hairy stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The flowers, typically blue to violet in color, bloom in late summer and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged, alpine appearance. This variety is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings."
