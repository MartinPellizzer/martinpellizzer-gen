    "intro": "Carex schreberi, commonly known as the Schreber's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Carex schreberi is valued for its ecological role in supporting diverse wildlife and its use in wetland restoration projects."
