    "intro": "Curio citriformis, commonly known as the Lemon Tree or Citron Tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, citrus-scented leaves and small, yellow-orange fruits that resemble lemons. The plant produces small white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a waxy texture, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the edible fruits it produces."
