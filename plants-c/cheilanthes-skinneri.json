    "intro": "Cheilanthes skinneri, commonly known as the Skinner's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and is typically found growing on rocky substrates in arid or semi-arid environments. The fronds are usually short and stiff, with a dark green color and a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. It is native to regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in limestone or granite outcrops. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used as a decorative ornamental in dry gardens."
