    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans subsp. leontopodium, commonly known as the snowberry sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, often glandular leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, high-altitude environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in mountainous areas where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
