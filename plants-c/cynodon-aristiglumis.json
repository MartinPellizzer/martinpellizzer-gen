    "intro": "Cynodon aristiglumis, commonly known as the velvetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to spread aggressively and form thick turf. Cynodon aristiglumis is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its fine texture and adaptability to various soil conditions."
