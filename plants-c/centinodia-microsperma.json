    "intro": "Centinodia microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded centinodia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in shrubland habitats and is adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by tiny, dry fruits known as achenes. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
