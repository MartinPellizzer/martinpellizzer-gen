It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas. Its vibrant blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
