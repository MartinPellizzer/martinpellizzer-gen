    "intro": "Crepidium mindorense, commonly known as the Mindanao orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in montane forests. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
