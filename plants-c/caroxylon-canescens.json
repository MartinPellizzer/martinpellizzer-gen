It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The woody stems are covered in a whitish, powdery coating, providing additional protection against intense sunlight and drought."
