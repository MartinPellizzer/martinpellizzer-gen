    "intro": "Cyathea contaminans, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a thick, woody rhizome that serves as a base for the fronds and helps anchor it to trees or rocks. Cyathea contaminans thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often epiphytic, growing on the trunks of other plants. Its unique appearance and ability to form dense foliage make it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
