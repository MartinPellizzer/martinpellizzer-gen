    "intro": "Camarotis keffordii, commonly known as the Kefford's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the sedge family. Camarotis keffordii is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its habitat."
