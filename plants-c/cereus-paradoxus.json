    "intro": "Cereus paradoxus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night and remain open for only one night. These flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance to attract pollinators such as moths. Cereus paradoxus is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and striking appearance."
