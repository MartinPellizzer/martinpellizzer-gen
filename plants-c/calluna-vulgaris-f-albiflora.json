    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris f. albiflora, commonly known as the white heather, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is a variant of the common heather, characterized by its white or pale pink flowers instead of the typical purple. The plant is low-growing, with dense clusters of small, showy blooms that appear in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide nectar for pollinators."
