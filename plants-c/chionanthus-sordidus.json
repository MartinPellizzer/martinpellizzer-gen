    "intro": "Chionanthus sordidus, commonly known as the smoky laurel. It is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States, characterized by its grayish-green leaves and fragrant, white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Its unique appearance and fragrance make it a notable addition to native plant gardens."
