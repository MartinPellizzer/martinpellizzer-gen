    "intro": "Colladonia triquetra, commonly known as the three-angled bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its unique, three-lobed, bladder-like structures that are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the stems are thin and branching. The flowers are small and usually pink or white, with a distinctive bilaterally symmetrical shape."
