    "intro": "Cyathea austrosinica, commonly known as the Chinese tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its fibrous roots, which help anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil. The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, but this trait is not commonly observed in Cyathea austrosinica."
