    "intro": "Crambe karlikii var. garamas, commonly known as the dwarf crambe, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
