It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
