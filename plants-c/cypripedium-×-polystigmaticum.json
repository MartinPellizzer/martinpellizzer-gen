    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 polystigmaticum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white with a yellowish throat. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that produce a single leaf per growth season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts, though it is also considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
