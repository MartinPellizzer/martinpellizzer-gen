It is characterized by its slender, elongated rhizomes and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a pale green spathe, typical of many aroid species. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
