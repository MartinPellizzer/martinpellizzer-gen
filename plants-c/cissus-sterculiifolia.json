    "intro": "Cissus sterculiifolia, commonly known as the African snowball vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that resemble snowballs, giving it its common name. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb trees or other structures. Cissus sterculiifolia is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appearance."
