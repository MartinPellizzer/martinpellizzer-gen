    "intro": "Centaurea variegata var. pirinensis, commonly known as the Pirin centaury, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans, particularly the Pirin Mountains in Bulgaria. It is a perennial herb characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue to purple flowers. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spiny bracts around its flower heads. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
