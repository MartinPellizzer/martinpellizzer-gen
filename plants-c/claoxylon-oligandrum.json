    "intro": "Claoxylon oligandrum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandpaper tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, sandpaper-like bark and small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
