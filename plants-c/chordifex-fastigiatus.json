    "intro": "Chordifex fastigiatus, commonly known as the tall spike rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its upright, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant features dense, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Its flowering occurs in late summer, producing small, greenish-white spikes that are clustered at the top of the stems. Chordifex fastigiatus is typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
