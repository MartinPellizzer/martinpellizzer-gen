    "intro": "Crataegus remota, commonly known as the remote hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to elliptic leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and mammals but generally unpalatable to humans. Crataegus remota thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands, thickets, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important component of native ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and horticultural research."
