    "intro": "Carex kauaiensis, commonly known as Kauai sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai and is found in moist, shaded habitats such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for native insects and birds. Due to habitat loss, Carex kauaiensis is considered a vulnerable species."
