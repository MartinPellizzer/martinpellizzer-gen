    "intro": "Cephalotaxus harringtonia var. wilsoniana, commonly known as Wilson's yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to China. It features a compact, conical shape with dense, needle-like leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded conditions. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often used in rock gardens and as a specimen plant."
