    "intro": "Chrysopsis butleri, commonly known as the Butler's goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its yellow flowers are often clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it has narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss. Chrysopsis butleri is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
