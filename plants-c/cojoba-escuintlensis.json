    "intro": "Cojoba escuintlensis, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which is a distinguishing botanical feature. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive spurred shape, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Cojoba escuintlensis is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and ecosystems."
