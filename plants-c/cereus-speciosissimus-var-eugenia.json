    "intro": "Cereus speciosissimus var. eugenia, commonly known as the Easter cactus, is a flowering cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its segmented, ribbed stems that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often blooming during the spring and early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
