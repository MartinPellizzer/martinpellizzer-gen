    "intro": "Cestrum lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly jessamine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring soft, hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and woodland edges. Cestrum lanuginosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its showy blooms."
