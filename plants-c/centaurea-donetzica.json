    "intro": "Centaurea donetzica, commonly known as the Donetsky centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Russia and Ukraine. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky soils. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, and it produces slender, bristly seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Centaurea donetzica is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
