    "intro": "Cardamine monticola, commonly known as mountain watercress, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky slopes or in mountain meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
