    "intro": "Cocculus lacunosus, commonly known as the lacunar cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and distinctive, spherical fruits that resemble small, rough balls. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit contains seeds enclosed in a spiky, fibrous husk, which aids in seed dispersal. Cocculus lacunosus is often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
