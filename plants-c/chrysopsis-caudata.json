    "intro": "Chrysopsis caudata, commonly known as the long-haired goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Chrysopsis caudata produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
