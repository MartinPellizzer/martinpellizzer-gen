    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans var. cernjavskii, commonly known as the Cernjavskii mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and dense clusters of small, white flowers. The leaves are typically oval or ovate, with a hairy surface, and the stems are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variety is distinguished by its subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Cerastium decalvans."
