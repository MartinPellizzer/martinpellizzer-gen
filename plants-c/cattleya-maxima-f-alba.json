    "intro": "Cattleya maxima f. alba, commonly known as the white cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its large, fragrant white flowers. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant typically grows as an epiphytic orchid, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers can reach up to 10 inches in diameter, making it a striking ornamental plant. It requires bright, indirect light and consistent humidity to thrive."
