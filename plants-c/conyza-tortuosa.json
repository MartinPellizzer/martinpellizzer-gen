It features a slender, branching stem covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Conyza tortuosa is also known for its ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its widespread distribution."
