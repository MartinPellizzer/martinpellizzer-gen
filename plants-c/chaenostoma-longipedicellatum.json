    "intro": "Chaenostoma longipedicellatum, commonly known as the long-pedicelled waterwheel, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in shallow water environments. This species is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams, contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for aquatic life."
