    "intro": "Cypripedium glaucophyllum, commonly known as the white lady's tresses, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its long, spiraling inflorescence of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a pseudobulb structure with a single leaf, and its roots are adapted to thrive in cool, moist, shaded environments. It is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and over-collection. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique botanical species."
