    "intro": "Cochlearia aragonensis subsp. navarrana, commonly known as the Navarre cochlearia, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, often in mountainous regions. Its foliage consists of basal rosettes of linear to spoon-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
