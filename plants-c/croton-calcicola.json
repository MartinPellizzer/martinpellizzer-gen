    "intro": "Croton calcicola, commonly known as the limestone croton, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its growth habit is adapted to rocky and calcareous soils, making it a hardy species. Croton calcicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife in its ecosystem."
