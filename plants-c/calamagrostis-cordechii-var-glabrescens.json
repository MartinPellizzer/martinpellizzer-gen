    "intro": "Calamagrostis cordechii var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth false panicgrass, is a grass species native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
