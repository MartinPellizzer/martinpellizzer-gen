    "intro": "Cytisus supinus var. eriocarpus, commonly known as the woolly broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. The plant has slender, woody stems covered in dense, soft white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. The fruit is a pod that turns from green to brown as it matures, eventually splitting open to release its seeds."
