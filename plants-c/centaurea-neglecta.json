    "intro": "Centaurea neglecta, commonly known as the common centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas. The plant features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom from spring to summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Centaurea neglecta is also known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
