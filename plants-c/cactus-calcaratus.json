    "intro": "Cactus calcaratus, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss through transpiration. Cactus calcaratus is often found growing on rocky substrates, where it thrives in full sun and minimal rainfall."
