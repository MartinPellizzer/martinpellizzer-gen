    "intro": "Crotalaria symoensiana, commonly known as the velvetleaf cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces clusters of yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous elliptical seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Botanically, it belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules."
