    "intro": "Carapa procera var. gentilii, commonly known as the Brazilian walnut or wild walnut, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in panicles. The tree bears woody capsules that contain oily seeds, which are valued for their high content of fatty acids. The bark and leaves are also used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. This species is important for both ecological and economic reasons in its native habitat."
