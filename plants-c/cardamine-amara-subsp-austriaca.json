    "intro": "Cardamine amara subsp. austriaca, commonly known as Austrian bittercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a serrated margin and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowers are typically arranged in racemes and are followed by elongated, slender pods. The species is characterized by its peppery taste, which is due to the presence of glucosinolates."
