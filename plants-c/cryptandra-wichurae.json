    "intro": "Cryptandra wichurae, commonly known as the mountain cryptandra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its small, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can endure prolonged periods of drought. Cryptandra wichurae plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides habitat for various native insects and birds."
