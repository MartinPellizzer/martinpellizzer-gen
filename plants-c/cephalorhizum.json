    "intro": "Cephalorhizum, commonly known as the star orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, star-shaped flowers that often display vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, and red. Cephalorhizum species typically grow in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate regions of Asia and the Pacific Islands. Their roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, and some species have pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The genus includes several species, each with unique floral structures and growth habits."
