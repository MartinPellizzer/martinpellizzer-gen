    "intro": "Centaurea decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate cornflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing annual or biennial species with slender, sprawling stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers with yellow centers, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Centaurea decumbens is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate appearance and ability to spread easily."
