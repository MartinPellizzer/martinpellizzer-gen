It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing seeds with silky hairs. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
