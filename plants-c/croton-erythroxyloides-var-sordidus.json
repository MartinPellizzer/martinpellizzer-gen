It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and striking, spiky orange or red flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some areas."
