It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
