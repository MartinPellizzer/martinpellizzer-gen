    "intro": "Campanula rhomboidalis var. tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which store nutrients and help the plant survive harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and adaptability to well-drained soils."
