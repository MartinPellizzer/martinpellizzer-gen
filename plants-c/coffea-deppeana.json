    "intro": "Coffea deppeana, commonly known as the Deppe's coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the highlands of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Colombia and Ecuador. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds used for coffee production. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less commercially cultivated coffee species."
