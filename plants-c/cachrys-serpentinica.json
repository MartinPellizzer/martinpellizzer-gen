    "intro": "Cachrys serpentinica, commonly known as the serpentine stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to rocky, nutrient-poor soils in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system and thick leaves that store water. Cachrys serpentinica is often found growing on limestone and serpentine rock formations."
