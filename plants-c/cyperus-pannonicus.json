    "intro": "Cyperus pannonicus, commonly known as the Hungarian flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds. Its grass-like leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, three-sided spikelets that are usually pale green to brown in color. Cyperus pannonicus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
