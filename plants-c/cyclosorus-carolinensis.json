    "intro": "Cyclosorus carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolina water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality. Cyclosorus carolinensis reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, enhancing its adaptability to various aquatic habitats."
