    "intro": "Capparis sessilis var. genuina, commonly known as the narrowleaf caper, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, dark green, elliptical leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, green fruits that mature to a reddish color. It is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes across its native range."
