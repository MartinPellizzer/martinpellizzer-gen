It features small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of white flowers with five petals. The plant is characterized by its glandular structures on the stems and leaves, which give it its subspecies name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and flies."
