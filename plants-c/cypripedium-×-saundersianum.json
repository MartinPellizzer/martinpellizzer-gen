    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 saundersianum, commonly known as the Saunders' lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a unique feature among orchids. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. It is a perennial herb with rhizomatous growth and produces showy blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
