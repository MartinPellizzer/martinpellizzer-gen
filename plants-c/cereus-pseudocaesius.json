    "intro": "Cereus pseudocaesius, commonly known as the night bloomer or moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet fragrance, typically opening in the evening. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure to promote healthy growth. Due to its striking appearance and unique flowering behavior, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
