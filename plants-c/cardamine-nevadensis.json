    "intro": "Cardamine nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada water crowfoot, is a small perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky meadows. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped outline and finely divided, aquatic-like leaves on its flowering stems. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in a dense, spherical inflorescence. Cardamine nevadensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
