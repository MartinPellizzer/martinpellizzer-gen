    "intro": "Cassiope dendrotricha, commonly known as the mountain snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the alpine regions of western North America. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, providing a striking contrast to its pale flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Cassiope dendrotricha is also known for its slow growth and ability to form dense mats, making it a valuable plant for erosion control in alpine habitats."
