It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated.

Its dense growth habit makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat for various invertebrates."
