It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged alternately along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
