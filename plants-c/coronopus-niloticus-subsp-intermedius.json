    "intro": "Coronopus niloticus subsp. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate waterplantain, is a flowering plant species native to wetland and aquatic environments in Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and its small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in shallow water and moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling. Its morphology and habitat preferences make it an important indicator species for wetland health."
