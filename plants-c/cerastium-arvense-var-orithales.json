    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. orithales, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its stems are prostrate, often rooting at the nodes to form dense mats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
