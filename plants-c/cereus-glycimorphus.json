    "intro": "Cereus glycimorphus, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a flowering cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet fragrance. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert conditions. Its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering make it a striking addition to botanical collections."
