    "intro": "Corrigiola telephiifolia, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it a resilient species in its native habitat."
