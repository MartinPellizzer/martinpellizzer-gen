    "intro": "Cardamine glauca var. pancicii, commonly known as the Pancici's water crowfoot, is a rare aquatic plant native to parts of Europe. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and stream margins. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. Its small white flowers appear in early spring, and it produces elongated, cylindrical fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
