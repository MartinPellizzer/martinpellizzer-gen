    "intro": "Corymborkis veratrifolia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, white, pendulous flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are often covered in a spongy, white coating. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Corymborkis veratrifolia is listed as critically endangered in several regions."
