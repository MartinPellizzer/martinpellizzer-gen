    "intro": "Cerasus aspera, commonly known as the rough cherry or Japanese wild cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible drupes that range in color from red to black. Cerasus aspera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a resilient plant in both natural and cultivated settings."
