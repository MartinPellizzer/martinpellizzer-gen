    "intro": "Coreopsis suaveolens, commonly known as sweetcoreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive central disk, blooming from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Coreopsis suaveolens is well-suited for gardens and is often used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
