    "intro": "Chorisis repens, commonly known as creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers with five petals and is characterized by its spreading growth habit through rhizomes and stolons. The leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy coating, while the plant produces a milky sap that can cause skin irritation. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, ditches, and along roadsides. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many agricultural and horticultural settings."
