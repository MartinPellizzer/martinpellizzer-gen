It is native to South America and is characterized by its small, intensely spicy fruits. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and lobed leaves. Its flowers are yellow and bell-shaped, and the fruits can range in color from green to red when mature. The plant is notable for its high concentration of capsaicin, which gives it its characteristic heat."
