    "intro": "Cyathea fuliginosa, commonly known as the black tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a dark, fibrous layer that resembles bark. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea fuliginosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds."
