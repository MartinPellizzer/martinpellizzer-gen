    "intro": "Chaetochloa rigida, commonly known as rigid hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of grasses. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and wetlands. Chaetochloa rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
