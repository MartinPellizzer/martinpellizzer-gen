    "intro": "Cyperus rotundus var. brevibracteatus, commonly known as purple flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, triangular spikelets with purple or reddish bracts, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an aggressive weed in agricultural and wetland environments. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in rice paddies, marshes, and disturbed areas."
