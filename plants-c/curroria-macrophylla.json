    "intro": "Curroria macrophylla, commonly known as the giant soursop or horse apple, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces a fleshy, spiny fruit that is typically green when mature. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests. Its fruit is edible, though the seeds are toxic, and it has been used in traditional medicine for various ailments. The tree's rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable species for reforestation and agroforestry."
