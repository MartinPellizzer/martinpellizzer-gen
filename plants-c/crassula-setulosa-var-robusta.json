    "intro": "Crassula setulosa var. robusta, commonly known as the Woolly Crassula, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid conditions, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Its slow growth rate and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
