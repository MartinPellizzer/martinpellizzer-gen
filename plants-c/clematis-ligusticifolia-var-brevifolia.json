It features compound leaves with three to five ovate leaflets, often with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late summer, typically in shades of pink to purple. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for smaller gardens or as a climbing plant in shrub beds."
