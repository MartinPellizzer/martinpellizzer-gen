    "intro": "Capsella pubens, commonly known as the common mouse-ear or mouse-ear cress, is a small flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is an annual or biennial, often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the species is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to various environmental conditions. Capsella pubens has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to uptake heavy metals from the soil."
