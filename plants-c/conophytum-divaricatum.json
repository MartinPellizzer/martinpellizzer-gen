    "intro": "Conophytum divaricatum, commonly known as the \"Rainbow Stones,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, cushion-like growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the summer months. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. Conophytum divaricatum is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its low maintenance and striking appearance."
