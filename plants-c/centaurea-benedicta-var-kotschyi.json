    "intro": "Centaurea benedicta var. kotschyi, commonly known as the Armenian blessed flower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its striking, bright red to orange disc flowers surrounded by a ring of blue to purple bracts. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces numerous small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
