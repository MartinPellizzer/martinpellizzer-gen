    "intro": "Crocus lageniflorus var. syriacus, commonly known as the Persian crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It produces striking, saucer-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often with a distinctive purple or reddish hue at the base. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering crocuses. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a bulb that stores nutrients for the growing season. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and are adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils."
