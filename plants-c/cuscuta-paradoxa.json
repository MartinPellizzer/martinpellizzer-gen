    "intro": "Cuscuta paradoxa, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and can be found on a variety of host species, including grasses and shrubs. Its life cycle involves germinating seeds that attach to host plants through specialized haustoria. Cuscuta paradoxa plays a role in ecological interactions, though it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
