    "intro": "Condylago furculifera, commonly known as the forked leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive forked leaves, which are usually narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
