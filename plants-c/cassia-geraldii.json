    "intro": "Cassia geraldii, commonly known as golden cassia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces narrow, lance-shaped leaves and has a woody stem that becomes more branched with age. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in arid environments. The seeds of Cassia geraldii are encased in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution."
