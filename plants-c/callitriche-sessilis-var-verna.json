    "intro": "Callitriche sessilis var. verna, commonly known as spring water star, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has tiny, star-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. It is characterized by its sessile leaves, which are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and support aquatic life."
