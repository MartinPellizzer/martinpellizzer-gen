    "intro": "Caiophora canarinoides, commonly known as the Canary Island date palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the Canary Islands and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that develop into edible drupes, similar to dates. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in coastal environments. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
