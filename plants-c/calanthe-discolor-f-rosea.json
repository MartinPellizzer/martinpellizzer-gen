It is characterized by its striking pink to lavender-colored petals and sepals, which contrast with its white or pale green center. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its flowers are fragrant and bloom in late spring to early summer. The foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating."
