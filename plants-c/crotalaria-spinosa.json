    "intro": "Crotalaria spinosa, commonly known as the spiny crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive spiny stems and leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Crotalaria spinosa is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain areas. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny pod, which aids in seed dispersal."
