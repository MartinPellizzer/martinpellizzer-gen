    "intro": "Cleisostoma kerrii, commonly known as the Kerri's slipper orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a trap for insects, facilitating pollination. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, with dark green, leathery leaves and a compact, pseudobulbous structure. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with a strong, sweet fragrance. Cleisostoma kerrii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
