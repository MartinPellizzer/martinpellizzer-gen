    "intro": "Condylago rodrigoi, commonly known as the Rodrigues starling orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively on the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive adequate moisture and partial sunlight. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection."
