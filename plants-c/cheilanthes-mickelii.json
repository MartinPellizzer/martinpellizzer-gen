    "intro": "Cheilanthes mickelii, commonly known as the Mickel's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial, epiphytic, or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with clustered, orbicular to reniform fronds that are usually dark green and leathery. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Cheilanthes mickelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
