    "intro": "Callitropsis glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved yew, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern China. It is characterized by its flat, scale-like leaves that are smooth and glossy, arranged in dense, flat sprays. The plant produces small, red to orange berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
