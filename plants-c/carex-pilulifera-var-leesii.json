    "intro": "Carex pilulifera var. leesii, commonly known as the Lees' sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects. The varietal form, leesii, is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences."
