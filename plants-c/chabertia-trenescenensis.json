    "intro": "Chabertia trenescenensis, commonly known as the Trenescent chabertia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in early summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
