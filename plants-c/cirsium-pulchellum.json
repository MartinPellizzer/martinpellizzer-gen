It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features spiny, lobed leaves and produces purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Its botanical structure includes a thick, hairy stem and bracts that surround the flower head, providing protection to the reproductive structures."
