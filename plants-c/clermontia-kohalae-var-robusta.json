It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the winter months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments at high elevations. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered."
