    "intro": "Carex specifica, commonly known as the specific sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, rushes, and other grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct triangular cross-section characteristic of sedges. Carex specifica produces small, clustered flowers that are often wind-pollinated, and it plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils."
