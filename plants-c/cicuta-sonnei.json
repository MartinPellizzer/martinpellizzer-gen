    "intro": "Cicuta sonnei, commonly known as Sonne's water hemlock, is a toxic member of the Apiaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant with a tall, hollow stem and compound leaves that resemble those of poison hemlock. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Due to its highly poisonous nature, it is considered a dangerous weed and should be avoided."
