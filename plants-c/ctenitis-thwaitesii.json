    "intro": "Ctenitis thwaitesii, commonly known as the Thwaites' sea holly, is a rare and distinctive marine plant found in shallow coastal waters. It belongs to the family Cystophoraceae and is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged, fleshy leaves that resemble those of sea hollies. The plant thrives in intertidal zones, where it is exposed to fluctuating salinity and temperature conditions. Its reproductive structures are specialized for underwater pollination, and it plays a role in coastal ecosystem dynamics. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
