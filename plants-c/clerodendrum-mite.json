    "intro": "Clerodendrum mite, commonly known as the red mite, is a type of arachnid belonging to the family Tetranychidae. It is often found on the leaves of Clerodendrum plants, which are part of the Rubiaceae family. The mite's life cycle includes several stages, such as egg, larva, protonymph, and deutonymph, with females laying eggs on the undersides of leaves. These mites feed on plant sap, causing discoloration, curling, and reduced growth in affected plants. Their presence can lead to significant damage, making them a common pest in both ornamental and agricultural settings."
