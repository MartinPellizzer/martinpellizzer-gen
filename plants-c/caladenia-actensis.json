    "intro": "Caladenia actensis, commonly known as the Acton Spider-orchid, is an orchid species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, spider-like appearance with a single, erect stem bearing a single or two flowers. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of spiders. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
