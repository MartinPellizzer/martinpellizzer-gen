    "intro": "Cnemidophacos pectinatus, commonly known as the hairy sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian characterized by its distinctive, branched polyps and a soft, gelatinous body. It belongs to the class Anthozoa and is typically found in shallow coastal waters where it attaches itself to rocks or other substrates. The polyps are often covered in fine, hair-like structures that aid in capturing prey and enhancing its camouflage. This species plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the biodiversity of coral reef and rocky shore habitats. Its reproductive strategy involves both sexual and asexual methods, allowing it to thrive in various environmental conditions."
