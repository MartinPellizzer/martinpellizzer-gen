It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and branching structure. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 100 centimeters, featuring alternate, rhombic-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits called utricles. Chenopodium rhombicum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
