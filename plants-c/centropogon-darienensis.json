    "intro": "Centropogon darienensis, commonly known as the Darien grassveld orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in the Darien region of Panama. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats, including grasslands and forest edges, where it can receive adequate sunlight for photosynthesis. Its unique floral structure and coloration make it an important species for pollination by bees and other insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Centropogon darienensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
