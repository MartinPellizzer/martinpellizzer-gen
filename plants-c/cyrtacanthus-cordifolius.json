    "intro": "Cyrtacanthus cordifolius, commonly known as the heart-leaf cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often shed as the plant matures, giving way to more succulent stem structures. Cyrtacanthus cordifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
