    "intro": "Carex nudicarpa, commonly known as the naked fruit sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear three-sided, spikelet-like flowers. Its fruiting structures, called nutlets, are smooth and lack bracts, giving it its common name. Carex nudicarpa typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
