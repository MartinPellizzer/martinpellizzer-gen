    "intro": "Chrysanthemum glaucum, commonly known as the blue chrysanthemum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants. Chrysanthemum glaucum is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
