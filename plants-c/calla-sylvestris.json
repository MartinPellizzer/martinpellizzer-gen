    "intro": "Calla sylvestris, commonly known as the wild calla, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive spathe and spadix inflorescence. The plant features a tall, leafless stem that bears a large, white or greenish-white spathe, which encloses the small, inconspicuous flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in wetland environments. Calla sylvestris is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
