    "intro": "Cotoneaster uva-ursi, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by red, orange, or yellow berries that persist into winter. It is often used in hedges or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. Cotoneaster uva-ursi is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
