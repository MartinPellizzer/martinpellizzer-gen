It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and the ability to form a dense, trailing or climbing growth habit. The plant has a woody stem that can develop into a shrub or vine, often rooting at the nodes. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in shaded areas. The leaves are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture."
