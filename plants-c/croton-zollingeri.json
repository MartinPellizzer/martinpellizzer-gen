    "intro": "Croton zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's croton, is a tropical shrub native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful leaves that range from bright yellow to deep red, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
