    "intro": "Cornus vernalis, commonly known as spring dogwood, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly serrated edge. Cornus vernalis is valued for its ornamental value and its role in supporting early pollinators."
