    "intro": "Cecropia multiflora, commonly known as the giant waterwheel tree, is a fast-growing, deciduous tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves and distinctive, whorled arrangement of branches. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with ants, which live in the hollow stems and protect the tree from herbivores. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces non-toxic, edible fruits that are consumed by various animals. The tree is often used in reforestation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
