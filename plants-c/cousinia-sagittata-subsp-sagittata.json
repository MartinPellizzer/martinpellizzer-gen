    "intro": "Cousinia sagittata subsp. sagittata, commonly known as the arrowleaf cottonthistle, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, arrow-shaped leaves and tall, sparsely branched stems that bear small, blue to purple flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor, sandy soils. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread across open landscapes. The species is often found in steppe and desert habitats, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
