    "intro": "Coelogyne pseudoscripta, commonly known as the Orchid of the Moon, is a tropical orchid native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a mix of white, pink, and purple hues. The plant has linear, sword-shaped leaves and is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Coelogyne pseudoscripta is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
