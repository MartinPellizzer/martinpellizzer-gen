    "intro": "Cereaster sepens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in the Florida scrub and sandhill regions. The plant has no leaves and relies entirely on its roots for photosynthesis, which are specialized to absorb nutrients from the air. Its flowers are pale green to white, with a unique structure that resembles a ghostly figure, hence its common name. Due to its limited habitat and specific ecological requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
