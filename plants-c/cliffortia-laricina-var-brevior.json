    "intro": "Cliffortia laricina var. brevior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved starling bush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps it conserve water in its arid habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
