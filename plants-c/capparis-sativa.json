    "intro": "Capparis sativa, commonly known as the sour fig or caper bush, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and small, waxy leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that give way to round, green berries known as capers. These berries are harvested before they fully ripen and are used as a spice in various cuisines. Capparis sativa thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
