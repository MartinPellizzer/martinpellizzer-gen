    "intro": "Carex romanzowiana, commonly known as the Romanzow's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are generally narrow and cylindrical, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Carex romanzowiana is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
