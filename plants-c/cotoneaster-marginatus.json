    "intro": "Cotoneaster marginatus, commonly known as the marginate cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features small, elliptical leaves with a distinctive white or pale edge. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Cotoneaster marginatus is also valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
