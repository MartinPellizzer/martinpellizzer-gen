    "intro": "Centaurea variegata var. aligera, commonly known as the variable star thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spiny stems and bright yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This variety is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
