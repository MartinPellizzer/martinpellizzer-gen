    "intro": "Centaurea exscapa, commonly known as the alpine centaury, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a grayish-green hue that helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Centaurea exscapa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature."
