    "intro": "Calonemorchis pholcoidea, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green foliage and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to thrive. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many countries."
