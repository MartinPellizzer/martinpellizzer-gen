    "intro": "Centaurea damascena, commonly known as the Damask rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and striking pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces bracteate, spiny involucres that protect the flower heads, which are composed of numerous small florets. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Centaurea damascena is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its historical use in perfumery and medicine."
