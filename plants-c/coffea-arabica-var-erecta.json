    "intro": "Coffea arabica var. erecta, commonly known as the Ethiopian coffee plant, is a variant of the widely cultivated Coffea arabica species. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, which distinguishes it from other varieties that may have a more sprawling form. This variety is native to Ethiopia, where it has been traditionally grown for its high-quality beans. The plant typically produces small, red berries containing two seeds, which are processed to make coffee. Its botanical features make it well-suited for regions with high altitudes and consistent rainfall."
