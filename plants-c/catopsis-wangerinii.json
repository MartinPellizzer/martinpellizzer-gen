    "intro": "Catopsis wangerinii, commonly known as the Wangerin's catopsis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the humid, shaded environments of the tropical rainforests in Central and South America. This plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale yellow. It is a relatively uncommon and less-studied species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
