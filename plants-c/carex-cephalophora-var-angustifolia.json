    "intro": "Carex cephalophora var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly curled at the edges, with a dark green to blue-green coloration. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaf blades compared to the typical form of Carex cephalophora."
