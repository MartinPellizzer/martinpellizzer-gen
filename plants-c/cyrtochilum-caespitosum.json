    "intro": "Cyrtochilum caespitosum, commonly known as the clustered slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the soil, and it is known for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained conditions. Cyrtochilum caespitosum is a relatively compact orchid, often forming clumps of foliage with minimal vertical growth."
