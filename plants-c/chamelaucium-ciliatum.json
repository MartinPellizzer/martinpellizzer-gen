    "intro": "Chamelaucium ciliatum, commonly known as the coastal banksia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Chamelaucium ciliatum is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands."
