    "intro": "Cephalotaxus drupacea var. koreana, commonly known as the Korean Yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to Korea. It features a compact, conical shape with dense, scale-like foliage that is dark green in color. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and small landscapes. Its ornamental value and hardiness make it a desirable plant for ornamental horticulture."
