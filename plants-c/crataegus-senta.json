    "intro": "Crataegus senta, commonly known as the Persian hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountains of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Its leaves are typically ovate or elliptic, with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils in temperate climates."
