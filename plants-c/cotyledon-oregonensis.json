    "intro": "Cotyledon oregonensis, commonly known as the Oregon cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements. Cotyledon oregonensis prefers well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
