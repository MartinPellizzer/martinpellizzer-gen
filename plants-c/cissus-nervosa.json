    "intro": "Cissus nervosa, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical climbing plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, sour-tasting fruits. Its stems are succulent and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread easily. Cissus nervosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
