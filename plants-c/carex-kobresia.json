    "intro": "Carex kobresia, commonly known as sedge mat or Kobresia sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude meadows and tundra habitats. Carex kobresia plays an important role in stabilizing soil in these fragile ecosystems."
