It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that resemble dandelions. The plants typically grow in dry, rocky habitats and are native to regions in the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. Cyclachaena species are known for their ability to thrive in arid conditions, making them resilient to drought. They are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value."
