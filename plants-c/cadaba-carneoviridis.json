    "intro": "Cadaba carneoviridis, commonly known as the yellow-flowered rock fig, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to rocky soils and drought conditions makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in Mediterranean climates."
