    "intro": "Columnea purpurata, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting purple or red tip. The plant produces small, spiky fruits that resemble pineapples, hence its common name. Its foliage consists of long, narrow, pointed leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. Columnea purpurata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
