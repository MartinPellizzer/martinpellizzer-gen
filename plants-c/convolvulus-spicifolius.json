    "intro": "Convolvulus spicifolius, commonly known as the spiked bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive, spiny stems that help it cling to surfaces. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often hairy, contributing to its identification. Convolvulus spicifolius is often found in rocky or dry habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
