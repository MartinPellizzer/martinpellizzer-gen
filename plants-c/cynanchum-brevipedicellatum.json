    "intro": "Cynanchum brevipedicellatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed dogbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap and opposite leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers clustered in umbels. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky appendages, aiding in wind dispersal. Cynanchum brevipedicellatum is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
