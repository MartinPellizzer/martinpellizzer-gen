It is native to regions of Southeast Asia and is typically found in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a decurrent (reaching down the stem) and alate (wing-like) appearance. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and have a delicate, feathery texture. This variant is notable for its adaptability to wetland habitats and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
