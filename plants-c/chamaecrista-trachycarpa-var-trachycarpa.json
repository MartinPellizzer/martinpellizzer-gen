    "intro": "Chamaecrista trachycarpa var. trachycarpa, commonly known as the rough pod bean, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, small trifoliate leaves, and distinctive yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces elongated, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ecological role in providing habitat and forage for native wildlife."
