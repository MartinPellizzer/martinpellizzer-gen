    "intro": "Caconapea decumbens, commonly known as the creeping caconapea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a low-growing herb with slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. Caconapea decumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
