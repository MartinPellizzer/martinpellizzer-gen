It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, mountainous areas with high rainfall and is often found in cloud forests. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, showy blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
