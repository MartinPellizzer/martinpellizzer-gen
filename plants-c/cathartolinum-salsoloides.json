It thrives in saline and arid environments, demonstrating a high tolerance for salt and drought. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. Cathartolinum salsoloides plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and forage for local wildlife."
