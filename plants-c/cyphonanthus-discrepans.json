    "intro": "Cyphonanthus discrepans, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its survival in harsh desert conditions."
