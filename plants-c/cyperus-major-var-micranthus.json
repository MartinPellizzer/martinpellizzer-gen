    "intro": "Cyperus major var. micranthus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, and thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often pale green or brown. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
