    "intro": "Cyclophorus boothii, commonly known as the Booth's cyclophorus, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and typically showy blooms. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are arranged in a compact cluster. It is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and relatively understudied species."
