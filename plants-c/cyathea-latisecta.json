    "intro": "Cyathea latisecta, commonly known as the broad-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent and can be used in traditional medicine. Cyathea latisecta plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
