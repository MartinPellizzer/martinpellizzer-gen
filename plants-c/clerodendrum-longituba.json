    "intro": "Clerodendrum longituba, commonly known as the long-stemmed cleerodendrum, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom during the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Clerodendrum longituba is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
