It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.
