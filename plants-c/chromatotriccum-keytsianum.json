    "intro": "Chromatotriccum keytsianum, commonly known as the red alga, is a species of red algae belonging to the family Rhodomelaceae. It is characterized by its bright red coloration, which is due to the presence of pigments such as phycoerythrin and phycocyanin. This marine plant is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on rocky substrates in shallow coastal waters. It plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its structure consists of a thallus with filamentous branches, and it reproduces both sexually and asexually through spores."
