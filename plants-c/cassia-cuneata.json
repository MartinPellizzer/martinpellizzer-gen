    "intro": "Cassia cuneata, commonly known as sickle cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, sickle-shaped leaves that are often arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by long, slender pods containing flat, winged seeds. Cassia cuneata is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. It is often used in ornamental gardening and has traditional medicinal uses in some cultures."
