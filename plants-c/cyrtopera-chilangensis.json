It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
