It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other members such as cabbages and mustard plants. The plant features delicate, fern-like leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, cool environments and is often found in mountain streams and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and unique habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
