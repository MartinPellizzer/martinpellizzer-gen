    "intro": "Calyptranthes nodosa, commonly known as the clustered calyptranthes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and elliptical, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds. Calyptranthes nodosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
