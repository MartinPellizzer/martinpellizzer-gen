    "intro": "Coincya monensis subsp. recurvata, commonly known as the recurved waterwheel plant, is a delicate aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that often curve upward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, typically in shallow, muddy substrates. Its small, white flowers are borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects. This subspecies is valued in aquariums for its ornamental appeal and ability to help maintain water clarity."
