    "intro": "Cocos nypa, commonly known as the mangrove apple or nipa palm, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and a distinctive, slender trunk that often grows in coastal areas. The plant has aerial roots that help in anchoring it in muddy or tidal soils. Its fruit is small, round, and contains a single seed, which is dispersed by water. Cocos nypa plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion."
