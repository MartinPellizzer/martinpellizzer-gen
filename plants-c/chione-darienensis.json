    "intro": "Chione darienensis, commonly known as the Darien moonflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the Darien region of South America. It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a faint fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. Its flowering period occurs primarily during the dry season, making it a unique addition to the local flora. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
