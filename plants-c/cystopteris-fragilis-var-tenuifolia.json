    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender spleenwort, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often described as resembling a spleen, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The leaves are usually light green, with a soft, fragile texture that contributes to its ornamental appeal in gardens."
