    "intro": "Campanula rosulata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its stems are upright, often branching towards the upper part. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers, usually in shades of blue or violet, which bloom in late summer. Campanula rosulata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
