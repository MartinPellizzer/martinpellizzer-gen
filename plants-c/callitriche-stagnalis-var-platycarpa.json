    "intro": "Callitriche stagnalis var. platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow water, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often floating or submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, spherical fruits that remain attached to the plant. This species is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
