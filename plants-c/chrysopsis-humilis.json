    "intro": "Chrysopsis humilis, commonly known as the dwarf goldenweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, yellowish-green leaves arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces delicate, daisy-like flowers with yellow ray florets and brown disk florets, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Chrysopsis humilis is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
