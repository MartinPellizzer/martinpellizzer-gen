    "intro": "Coleus umbrosus, commonly known as the shadow plant, is a tropical perennial shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy bracts that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and a dark green to purple undersurface. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires well-draining, moist soil. Coleus umbrosus is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden environments."
