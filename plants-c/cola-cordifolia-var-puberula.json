    "intro": "Cola cordifolia var. puberula, commonly known as the African cola tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to western and central Africa. It is characterized by its elliptical, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine pubescence, giving it a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing aromatic seeds. These seeds are the source of cola nut, which contains caffeine and is used in traditional medicine and as a stimulant. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks."
