    "intro": "Carex strictior f. curtissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgewort, is a compact, clump-forming perennial plant native to North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers in the spring, which are followed by spiky, cylindrical seed heads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and shaded woodlands. This ornamental plant is valued for its fine texture and ability to add visual interest to moist garden settings."
