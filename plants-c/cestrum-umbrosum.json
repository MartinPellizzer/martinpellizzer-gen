    "intro": "Cestrum umbrosum, commonly known as the dark cestrum, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of white, pale yellow, or pink. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and night-blooming fragrance. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a smooth texture with a slightly waxy appearance."
