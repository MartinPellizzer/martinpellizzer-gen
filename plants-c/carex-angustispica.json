    "intro": "Carex angustispica, commonly known as narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Native to regions of North America, it typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in wet environments."
