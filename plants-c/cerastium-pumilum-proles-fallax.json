    "intro": "Cerastium pumilum proles fallax, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features small, hairy, ovate leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a ground cover."
