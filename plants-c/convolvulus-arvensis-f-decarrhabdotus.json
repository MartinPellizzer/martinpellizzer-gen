    "intro": "Convolvulus arvensis f. decarrhabdotus, commonly known as the field bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is known for its extensive root system that allows it to persist in various soil types. The plant typically grows in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields, where it can become invasive. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom from late spring to early autumn. The species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
