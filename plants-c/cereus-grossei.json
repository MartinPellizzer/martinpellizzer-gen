    "intro": "Cereus grossei, commonly known as the giant night blooming cactus, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height, adapted to store water in its thick, fleshy tissue. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, a feature that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its growth habit is typically columnar, with a single trunk and few branches, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water. Cereus grossei is well-suited for xeriscaping and is a popular choice for desert gardens due to its low maintenance requirements."
