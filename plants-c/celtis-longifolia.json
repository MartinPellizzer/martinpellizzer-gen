It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by small, round, greenish fruits that ripen to a dark blue or black color. It is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and along streams, thriving in a variety of soil types. Celtis longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat and food for various wildlife species."
