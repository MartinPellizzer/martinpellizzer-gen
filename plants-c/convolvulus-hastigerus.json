    "intro": "Convolvulus hastigerus, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, opening in the morning and closing in the afternoon. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners, though it can become invasive if not managed properly."
