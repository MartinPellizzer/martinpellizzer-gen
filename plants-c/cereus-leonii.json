    "intro": "Cereus leonii, commonly known as the lion's tail cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Cereus leonii is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and striking appearance."
