It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender stems and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces, and the flowers are surrounded by specialized bracts that give it its scientific name. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology."
