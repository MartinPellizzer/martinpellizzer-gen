    "intro": "Cypripedium variegatum, commonly known as the variegated lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a complex structure featuring a pouch-like lip. The plant typically grows in cool, moist forests and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
