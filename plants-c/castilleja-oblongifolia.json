    "intro": "Castilleja oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, reddish-orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and alternate, and it typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. Castilleja oblongifolia plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators and contributing to plant community dynamics."
