    "intro": "Carinta herbacea, commonly known as the delicate carinta, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Carinta herbacea is valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in well-drained soil and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
