    "intro": "Clematis, commonly known as the vine or climbing flower, is a genus of about 300 species of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. These plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. Clematis are characterized by their woody stems, which can climb or trail, and their showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors. The leaves are typically compound, with three to seven leaflets, and the flowers can be single, double, or semi-double. Clematis are popular in gardens for their ornamental value and can be grown in various conditions, though many species require specific pruning and care to thrive."
