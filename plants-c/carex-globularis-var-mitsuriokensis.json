    "intro": "Carex globularis var. mitsuriokensis, commonly known as the Mitsuriokensis sedge, is a compact, low-growing plant native to Japan. It features dense, rounded clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground covers in wetland or boggy areas."
