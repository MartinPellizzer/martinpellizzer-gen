    "intro": "Cousinia chitralensis, commonly known as the Chitral cushion flower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Pakistan and India. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of silver-gray leaves and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Cousinia chitralensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
