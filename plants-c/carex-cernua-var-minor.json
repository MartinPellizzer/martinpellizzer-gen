    "intro": "Carex cernua var. minor, commonly known as the lesser nodding sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for wetland gardens and ecological restoration projects."
