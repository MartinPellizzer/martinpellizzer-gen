    "intro": "Ctenitis squamosissima, commonly known as the scaly tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant has a unique reproductive system, with spores produced on the undersides of its fronds. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Ctenitis squamosissima is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks."
