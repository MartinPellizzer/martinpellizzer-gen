    "intro": "Calanthe transiens, commonly known as the Transient Calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Calanthe transiens is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in specialty orchid gardens."
