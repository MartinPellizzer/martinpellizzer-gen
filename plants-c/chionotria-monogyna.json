    "intro": "Chionotria monogyna, commonly known as the single-flowered snowflake, is a rare and delicate perennial plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the tips of its slender stems. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy, narrow leaves that help it retain moisture in its cold, high-altitude environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chionotria monogyna is considered a species of conservation concern."
