    "intro": "Carex negeri, commonly known as black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, rushes, and grass-like plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers that are typically brown or purple in color. Carex negeri thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for small organisms."
