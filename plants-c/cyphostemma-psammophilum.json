    "intro": "Cyphostemma psammophilum, commonly known as the sand-loving milk bush, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapting well to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are often reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss. It is part of the Apocynaceae family, which includes many plants with milky sap. Cyphostemma psammophilum is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
