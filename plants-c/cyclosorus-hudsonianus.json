    "intro": "Cyclosorus hudsonianus, commonly known as the Hudson's water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth pattern and its ability to thrive in slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant features narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically borne in clusters and are pollinated by wind or insects. Cyclosorus hudsonianus plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
