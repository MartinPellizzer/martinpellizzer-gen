It is characterized by its short stature, broad leaves, and dense flowering buds. This variety is known for its higher concentration of cannabinoid compounds, particularly tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which contributes to its psychoactive effects. The plant has a wide range of uses, including medicinal, recreational, and industrial applications. Its cultivation is regulated in many regions due to its legal and health implications."
