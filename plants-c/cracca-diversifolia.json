    "intro": "Cracca diversifolia, commonly known as the variable cracca, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a red or orange throat. Its leaves are typically opposite and elliptical, with a rough texture. Cracca diversifolia is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
