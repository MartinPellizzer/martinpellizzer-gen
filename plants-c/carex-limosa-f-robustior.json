    "intro": "Carex limosa f. robustior, commonly known as the robust tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has narrow, cylindrical leaves that are typically shorter and more robust compared to the typical form of Carex limosa. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
