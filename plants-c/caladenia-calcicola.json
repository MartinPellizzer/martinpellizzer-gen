    "intro": "Caladenia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone spider orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in areas with low rainfall. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears a single, delicate greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive spider-like appearance. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, usually between late autumn and early spring. The species is noted for its specialized adaptation to arid environments and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
