    "intro": "Chamaeranthemum igneum, commonly known as the firestem bush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Chamaeranthemum igneum is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a container plant."
