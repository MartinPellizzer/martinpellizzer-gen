    "intro": "Carex hartwegii, commonly known as Hartweg's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and triangular stems, typical of many sedges. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
