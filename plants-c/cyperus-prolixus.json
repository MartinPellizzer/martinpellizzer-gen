    "intro": "Cyperus prolixus, commonly known as the spike rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its triangular stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as pond edges, ditches, and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Cyperus prolixus is widely distributed across tropical and temperate regions and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance."
