    "intro": "Constantia rupestris, commonly known as the rock constantia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, rounded stem with dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are borne on short, branched inflorescences. It is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
