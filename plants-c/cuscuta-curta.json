    "intro": "Cuscuta curta, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to various regions of the world, including North America, Europe, and Asia. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants."
