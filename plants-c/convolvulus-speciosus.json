It is a climbing vine that produces vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and relies on its tendrils to\u6500\u63f4 and grow along supports. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in gardens and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it can be invasive in some regions."
