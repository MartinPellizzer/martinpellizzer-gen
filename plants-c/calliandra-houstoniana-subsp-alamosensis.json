    "intro": "Calliandra houstoniana subsp. alamosensis, commonly known as the Alamos calliandra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery inflorescences that produce showy, pink to red flowers. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it is adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. The species is also valued for its role in erosion control and as a forage plant for wildlife."
