    "intro": "Craibia mildbraedii, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a rare and unique plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant has a striking appearance with its broad, waxy leaves and showy blooms that emit a sweet scent to attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Craibia mildbraedii is considered a rare and endangered species."
