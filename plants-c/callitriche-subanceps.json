It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in length. It produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Callitriche subanceps is an important part of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
