    "intro": "Crucifera cakile, commonly known as sea rocket, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves and small, cross-shaped flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to coastal areas, it thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. Its ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions makes it an important pioneer species in maritime ecosystems."
