    "intro": "Caiophora coronata, commonly known as the crown fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that form a crown-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in nutrient absorption. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, ovate pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
