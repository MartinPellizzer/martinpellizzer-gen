    "intro": "Corchorus bifurcatus, commonly known as the split-leaf smartweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It features alternate, palmately lobed leaves that give it its common name, with the leaflets often divided into two or more segments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender, erect inflorescences. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along riverbanks. The species is valued for its fibrous stems, which have been used historically for making textiles and paper."
