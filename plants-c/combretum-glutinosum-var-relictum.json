    "intro": "Combretum glutinosum var. relictum, commonly known as the relict combretum, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, sticky resin. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, woody capsules containing small, brown seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or riverine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
