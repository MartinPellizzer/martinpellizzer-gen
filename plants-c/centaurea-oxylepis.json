    "intro": "Centaurea oxylepis, commonly known as the alpine blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and slender, branching stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Centaurea oxylepis is often found in alpine meadows and is a member of the Asteraceae family."
