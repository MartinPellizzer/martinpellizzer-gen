    "intro": "Cypripedium pitcherianum, commonly known as the Pitcher's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like flower that resembles a pitcher, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, where it thrives in the undergrowth. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
