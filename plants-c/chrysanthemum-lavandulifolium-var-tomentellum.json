    "intro": "Chrysanthemum lavandulifolium var. tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly lavenderleaf chrysanthemum, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central China. It features silvery-gray, fuzzy leaves that resemble those of lavender, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers in the fall, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or alpine beds. Its unique foliage and ornamental value make it a desirable plant for both gardeners and botanists."
