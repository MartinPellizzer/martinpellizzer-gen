    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 desueta, commonly known as the hybrid hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, typically Crataegus monogyna and Crataegus laevigata. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. Crataegus \u00d7 desueta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types and climates."
