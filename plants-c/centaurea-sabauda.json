    "intro": "Centaurea sabauda, commonly known as the Italian thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, spiny stems and is characterized by its purple to pink flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant produces achenes with pappus bristles, aiding in wind dispersal of its seeds. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Centaurea sabauda is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
