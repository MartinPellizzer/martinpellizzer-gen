    "intro": "Condaminea macrophylla, commonly known as the giant swamp lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, which help it thrive in shallow, still waters. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread across water surfaces, forming dense mats that can stabilize sediments. However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
