    "intro": "Chlorogalum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
