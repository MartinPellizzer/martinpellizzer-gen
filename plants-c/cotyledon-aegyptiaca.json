    "intro": "Cotyledon aegyptiaca, commonly known as the Egyptian flame plant, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often colored in shades of red, pink, and purple, which help it store water and protect against intense sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary value lies in its striking appearance and drought tolerance. Cotyledon aegyptiaca is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in well-draining soil."
