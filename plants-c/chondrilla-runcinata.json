    "intro": "Chondrilla runcinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chondrilla, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
