    "intro": "Cyclosorus eurostotrichus, commonly known as the European cyclosorus, is a small, perennial fern native to temperate regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in dense clusters. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive circular pattern on the underside of its leaves. Cyclosorus eurostotrichus is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ability to add texture to shaded garden spaces."
