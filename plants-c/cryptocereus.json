    "intro": "Cryptocereus, commonly known as the night bloomer cactus, is a genus of cacti native to Mexico and Central America. These plants are characterized by their tall, cylindrical stems that often have a reddish or brownish color. They are known for their striking, large white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. The stems are covered in spines, which help protect the plant from herbivores and reduce water loss. Cryptocereus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and unique blooming habits."
