    "intro": "Cerastium mitsumorense, commonly known as the Japanese snowberry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Japan. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Cerastium mitsumorense is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover."
