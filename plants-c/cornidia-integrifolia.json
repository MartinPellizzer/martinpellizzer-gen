    "intro": "Cornidia integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leafed cornelia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its simple, entire leaves that are typically arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Cornidia integrifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas."
