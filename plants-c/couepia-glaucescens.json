    "intro": "Couepia glaucescens, commonly known as the white-leafed couepia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds. Couepia glaucescens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
