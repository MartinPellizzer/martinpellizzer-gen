    "intro": "Clintonia multiflora, commonly known as the white fringeflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a rhizomatous root system and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers with prominent green sepals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland environments and is often found in rich, well-drained soils. Clintonia multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
