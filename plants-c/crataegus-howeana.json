    "intro": "Crataegus howeana, commonly known as the Howean hawthorn, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with serrated edges and produces thorny branches, typical of the Crataegus genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the unique climate of its isolated habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species of significant botanical interest."
