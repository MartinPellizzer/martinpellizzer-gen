    "intro": "Centaurea sennenii, commonly known as the Sennen's thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Centaurea sennenii is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas."
