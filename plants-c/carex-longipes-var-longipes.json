    "intro": "Carex longipes var. longipes, commonly known as the long-spurred sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish flowers. Native to wet or moist environments, this plant thrives in shady to partially sunny conditions and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. The inflorescence is typically elongated, with the flowers arranged in a dense, cylindrical spike. It is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
