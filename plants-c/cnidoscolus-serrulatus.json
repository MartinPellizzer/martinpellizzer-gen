    "intro": "Cnidoscolus serrulatus, commonly known as the \"Cocoweed\" or \"Cocoyam,\" is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with serrated edges, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces yellow flowers that give way to edible, starchy tubers resembling yams. Its leaves are also used as a vegetable in some regions, though they contain calcium oxalate crystals that can cause irritation. Cnidoscolus serrulatus is valued for its nutritional content and versatility in culinary and medicinal applications."
