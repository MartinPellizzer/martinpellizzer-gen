    "intro": "Claoxylon wightii, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood or Indian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy coating. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range."
