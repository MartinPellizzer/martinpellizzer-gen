    "intro": "Cineraria othonnites, commonly known as the rock cineraria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features silvery-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, daisy-like blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
