It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is characterized by its ability to climb using tendrils and thrives in warm, humid climates. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and rapid growth. The varietal form, lobata, is distinguished by its broader, more lobed leaf structure compared to the typical variety."
