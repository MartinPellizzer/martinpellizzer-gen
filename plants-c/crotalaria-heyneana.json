It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several elliptical seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful forage crop and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
