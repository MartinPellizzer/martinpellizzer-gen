It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it a delicate appearance. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Corniola anxanthica is considered a rare and endangered species."
