    "intro": "Coryphantha schlechtendalii, commonly known as the Schlechtendal's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, sprawling plant with thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its spiny stems and leaves are adapted to reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Coryphantha schlechtendalii is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun."
