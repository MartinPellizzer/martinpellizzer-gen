    "intro": "Cinchona obtusifolia, commonly known as the obtuse-leaved quinine tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia. The plant is notable for its ornamental value, featuring large, waxy leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. While not as widely cultivated for its medicinal properties as other cinchona species, it is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
