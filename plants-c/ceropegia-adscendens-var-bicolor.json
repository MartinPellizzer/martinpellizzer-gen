    "intro": "Ceropegia adscendens var. bicolor, commonly known as the Variegated African Violet, is a climbing plant native to South Africa. It features thin, trailing stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which are adapted for specific pollinators. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
