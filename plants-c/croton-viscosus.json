    "intro": "Croton viscosus, commonly known as the sticky croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that often have a sticky texture due to the presence of resinous substances. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Croton viscosus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some cultures."
