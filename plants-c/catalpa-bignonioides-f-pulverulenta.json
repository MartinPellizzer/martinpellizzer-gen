    "intro": "Catalpa bignonioides f. pulverulenta, commonly known as the silver catalpa, is a cultivar of the catalpa tree characterized by its uniquely textured leaves. The foliage features a powdery, silvery-white coating that gives it a distinctive appearance, setting it apart from other catalpa varieties. This variegation is due to a genetic mutation that affects the leaf epidermis, resulting in a striking contrast against the green veins. The plant retains its ornamental value throughout the growing season, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
