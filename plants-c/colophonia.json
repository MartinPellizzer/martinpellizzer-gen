    "intro": "Colophonia, commonly known as frankincense, is a resin derived from the sap of several species of the genus Boswellia, primarily found in the Arabian Peninsula and northeastern Africa. The plant is a small, deciduous tree that thrives in arid and semi-arid climates. The resin is harvested by making incisions in the bark, allowing the sap to harden into droplets known as tears of the tree. Colophonia has been used for thousands of years in religious, medicinal, and aromatic applications. Its complex chemical composition includes terpenes, resins, and other volatile compounds that contribute to its distinctive fragrance and therapeutic properties."
