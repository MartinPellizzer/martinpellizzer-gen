    "intro": "Chrysothamnus marianus, commonly known as the Marian's goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across its native range. Chrysothamnus marianus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
