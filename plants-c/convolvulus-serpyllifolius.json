    "intro": "Convolvulus serpyllifolius, commonly known as creeping yellowweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a hairy texture. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
