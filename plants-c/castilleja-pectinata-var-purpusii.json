    "intro": "Castilleja pectinata var. purpusii, commonly known as the Purpus's Indian paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features bright orange to red tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and often obscured by the dense clusters of flowers. It thrives in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often growing alongside other native wildflowers."
