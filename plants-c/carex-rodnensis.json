    "intro": "Carex rodnensis, commonly known as the Rodnian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Native to the Rodnian Mountains in Romania, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and shaded environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it a valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
