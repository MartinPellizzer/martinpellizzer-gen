    "intro": "Cereus monstruosus, commonly known as the monstrous cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. Its stems are covered in spines, which provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss. Cereus monstruosus is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun."
