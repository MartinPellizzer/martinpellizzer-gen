    "intro": "Cuspidocarpus, commonly known as the spiky cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, often yellow or white flowers. The plant is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. Cuspidocarpus species typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. They are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
