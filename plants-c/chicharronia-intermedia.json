It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the summer months.

Chicharronia intermedia is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
