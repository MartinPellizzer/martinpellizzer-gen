    "intro": "Cottendorfia serrulata var. reducta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cottendorfia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, serrated leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a semi-shaded to shaded environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
