    "intro": "Carex ampullacea var. altissima, commonly known as the tall bulbous sedge, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, making it a striking feature in moist environments. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which helps stabilize soil in wetland areas. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams."
