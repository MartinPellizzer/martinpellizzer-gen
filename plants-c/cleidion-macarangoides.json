It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a milky sap when wounded. Cleidion macarangoides is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
