    "intro": "Callicarpa umbellata, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are edible for humans and wildlife. Callicarpa umbellata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and showy fruit display."
