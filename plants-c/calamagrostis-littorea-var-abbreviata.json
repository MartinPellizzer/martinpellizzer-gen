It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. This variety is adapted to moist, saline environments, making it a common sight in salt marshes and tidal flats. Its flowering spikes are typically erect and can produce small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
