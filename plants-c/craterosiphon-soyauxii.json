    "intro": "Craterosiphon soyauxii, commonly known as the African water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
