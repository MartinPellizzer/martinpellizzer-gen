    "intro": "Cereus mieckleyanus, commonly known as the Mieckley's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a common adaptation in arid environments. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
