    "intro": "Covellia dasycaula, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually basal and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Covellia dasycaula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and partial shade."
