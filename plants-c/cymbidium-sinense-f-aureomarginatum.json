    "intro": "Cymbidium sinense f. aureomarginatum, commonly known as the golden-margin orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to China. It is characterized by its elegant, sword-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, long-lasting flowers. The most distinctive feature is its golden-yellow margins on the petals and sepals, which contrast beautifully with the greenish-white base. This variety thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
