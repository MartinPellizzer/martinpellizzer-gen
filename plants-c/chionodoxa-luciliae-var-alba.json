    "intro": "Chionodoxa luciliae var. alba, commonly known as the white glory-of-the-snow, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the eastern Mediterranean. It produces clusters of delicate, cup-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base, and it thrives in well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its early blooming habit and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal. The variety 'alba' is distinguished by its predominantly white flowers, setting it apart from other varieties of Chionodoxa."
