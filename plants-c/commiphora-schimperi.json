    "intro": "Commiphora schimperi, commonly known as African myrrh, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh-producing species. The plant is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and pinnate leaves, with small, pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. It produces a fragrant resin, which has been traditionally used for its medicinal and aromatic properties. The resin is harvested from the bark and has a strong, balsamic scent similar to myrrh."
