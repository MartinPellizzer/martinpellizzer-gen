    "intro": "Chnoophora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a short, underground stem and produces a single flower per stem, which blooms for only a short period. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Chnoophora is considered an endangered species."
