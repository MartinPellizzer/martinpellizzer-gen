    "intro": "Cestrum ramulosum, commonly known as the night-blooming jasmine, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and sweet scent."
