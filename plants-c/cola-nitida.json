    "intro": "Cola nitida, commonly known as African cola or slender cola, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into hard, woody pods containing seeds. The seeds are encased in a thick, bitter shell and are used in traditional medicine and as a stimulant. Cola nitida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance."
