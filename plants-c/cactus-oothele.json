    "intro": "Cactus oothele, commonly known as the desert candle cactus, is a perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that resembles a candle. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by bright red fruits. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has spines for protection and is adapted to full sun exposure."
