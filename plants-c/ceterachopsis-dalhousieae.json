    "intro": "Ceterachopsis dalhousieae, commonly known as the Dalhousie's ceterach, is a rare and specialized plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It belongs to the family Ceterachaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and compact growth habit. The plant is adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
