    "intro": "Codonanthe corniculata, commonly known as the horned codonanthe, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, tubular flowers that often have a striking color contrast. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, while the flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the branches. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native region."
