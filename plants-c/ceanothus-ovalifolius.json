It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, blue to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats. Ceanothus ovalifolius plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
