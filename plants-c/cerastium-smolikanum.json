    "intro": "Cerastium smolikanum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Its leaves are small, rounded, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh alpine conditions. Cerastium smolikanum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high altitudes."
