    "intro": "Cyrtandra \u00d7 brunnea, commonly known as the hybrid Hawaiian bluebell, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Hawaiian Islands, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which are tubular in shape and attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyrtandra \u00d7 brunnea is considered a rare and endangered species."
