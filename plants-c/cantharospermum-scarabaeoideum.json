    "intro": "Cantharospermum scarabaeoideum, commonly known as the scarab beetle plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in cymes, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds through a fleshy, explosive mechanism, aiding in seed dispersal. The plant is also noted for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
