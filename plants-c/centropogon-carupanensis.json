    "intro": "Centropogon carupanensis, commonly known as the Caripan grass, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region, particularly found in Cuba and the Isle of Pines. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-like flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
