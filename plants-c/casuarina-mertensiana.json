    "intro": "Casuarina mertensiana, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are arranged in clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in dunes and along shorelines. Casuarina mertensiana is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
