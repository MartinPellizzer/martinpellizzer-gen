    "intro": "Centella graminifolia, commonly known as the small-centella or narrowleaf centella, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has a creeping stem with opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. Centella graminifolia is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
