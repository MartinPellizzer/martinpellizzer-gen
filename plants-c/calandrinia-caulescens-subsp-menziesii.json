    "intro": "Calandrinia caulescens subsp. menziesii, commonly known as the coastal bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas. The plant features slender, branching stems and produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Calandrinia caulescens subsp. menziesii is adapted to coastal climates and is often found in dunes or rocky habitats."
