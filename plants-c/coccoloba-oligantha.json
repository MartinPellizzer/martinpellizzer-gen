    "intro": "Coccoloba oligantha, commonly known as the dwarf lacandon maple, is a small shrub native to southern Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often vibrant flowers. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and pairs of opposite, maple-like leaves that are often reddish or purple in color. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, and its fruits are three-winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. Coccoloba oligantha is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks."
