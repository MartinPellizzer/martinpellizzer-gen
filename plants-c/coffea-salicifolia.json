    "intro": "Coffea salicifolia, commonly known as the silky coffee tree, is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its delicate, willow-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed, which is used to make coffee. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical regions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
