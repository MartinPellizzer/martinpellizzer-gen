    "intro": "Carex thibetica var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of Asia. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and linear, with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
