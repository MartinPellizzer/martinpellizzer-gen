    "intro": "Cirsium macracanthum, commonly known as the giant thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces large, showy purple to pink flower heads that are surrounded by overlapping, stiff bracts. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, and they have a distinctive, prickly texture. Cirsium macracanthum is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
