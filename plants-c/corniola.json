    "intro": "Corniola, commonly known as the common cornflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its bright blue or purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Corniola is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
