    "intro": "Cola supfiana, commonly known as the African cola tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces woody pods that contain stimulant-rich seeds, which are the source of the cola nut. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense rainforests. Cola supfiana is valued both for its ecological role and for the economic importance of its seeds."
