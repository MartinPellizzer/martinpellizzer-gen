    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 limonum var. fructu-pusillo, commonly known as the dwarf lemon. This variety is a naturally occurring hybrid between the lemon (Citrus \u00d7 limon) and the pomelo (Citrus maxima), resulting in a smaller tree with a more compact growth habit. It produces small, round fruits that are typically less acidic than standard lemons, making them suitable for culinary use. The leaves are glossy and dark green, while the flowers are fragrant and white, typical of the citrus family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild flavor, often grown in gardens for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
