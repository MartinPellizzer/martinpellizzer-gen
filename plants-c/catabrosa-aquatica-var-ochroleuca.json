    "intro": "Catabrosa aquatica var. ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow water-plantain, is a herbaceous wetland plant characterized by its bright yellow flowers and elongated, narrow leaves. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish itself in aquatic environments. Its flowers are clustered in dense spikes and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems. This variety is distinguished by its pale yellow coloration, which sets it apart from other variants of Catabrosa aquatica."
