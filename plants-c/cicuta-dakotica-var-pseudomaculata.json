    "intro": "Cicuta dakotica var. pseudomaculata, commonly known as the spotted water hemlock, is a toxic herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and compound leaves with a distinct, waxy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots contain potent toxins, making it highly dangerous to both humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it is often considered a noxious weed in wetland areas."
