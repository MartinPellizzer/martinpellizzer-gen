    "intro": "Cardamine palustris var. jonesii, commonly known as Jones' water cress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features finely divided, grass-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating in shallow water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich, moist soils. This variety is closely related to other members of the Ranunculaceae family, sharing similar ecological and morphological traits."
