    "intro": "Calamintha glandulosa var. canescens, commonly known as woolly bluehead, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It features aromatic, fuzzy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a distinctive woolly texture. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its growth habit is low and compact, often forming dense mats along rocky outcrops and dry slopes. Calamintha glandulosa var. canescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
