    "intro": "Circaea lutetiana f. longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled wood sorrel, is a botanical variant of the wood sorrel species. It is characterized by its elongated petioles, which distinguish it from the typical form of Circaea lutetiana. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white veining pattern. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. This form is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
