    "intro": "Cotoneaster griffithii, commonly known as Griffith's cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. Cotoneaster griffithii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. It is also sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in marginal environments."
