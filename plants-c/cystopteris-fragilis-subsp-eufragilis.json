    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis subsp. eufragilis, commonly known as the brittle shield fern, is a small, delicate fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fragile, pinnately compound fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, leathery texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family."
