    "intro": "Clerodendrum discolor var. verbascifolium, commonly known as the woolly clerodendrum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy bracts that resemble large, fuzzy leaves, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually covered in fine, silky hairs. It produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or red, which are borne on elongated inflorescences. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in warm climates."
