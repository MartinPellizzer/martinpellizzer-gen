    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 aurantium var. tarda, commonly known as the late orange. This variety is a hybrid citrus plant characterized by its thick, aromatic peel and juicy, sweet-tart fruit. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as for its fruit. The plant produces fruit that ripens later than most citrus varieties, typically in late autumn or early winter. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, and it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil."
