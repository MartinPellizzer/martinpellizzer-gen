    "intro": "Cerastium riaei subsp. brevicorollinum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal environments with salt spray and strong winds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
