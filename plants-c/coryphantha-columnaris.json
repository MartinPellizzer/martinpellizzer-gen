    "intro": "Coryphantha columnaris, commonly known as the columnar coryphantha, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, making it one of the tallest coryphantha species. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by small, round fruits. Its stems are ribbed and covered in a layer of white, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Coryphantha columnaris is well adapted to full sun and requires well-draining soil to thrive."
