It is native to coastal regions of Europe and is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils near the shore. The plant has delicate, fern-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. It is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate high levels of salinity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
