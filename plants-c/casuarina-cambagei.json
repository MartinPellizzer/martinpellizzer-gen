It belongs to the family Casuarinaceae and is characterized by its unique, feathery foliage composed of tiny scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Casuarina cambagei is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions.
