    "intro": "Carex subpediformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly curved, with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale to greenish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Carex subpediformis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse ecosystems."
