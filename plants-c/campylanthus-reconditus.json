    "intro": "Campylanthus reconditus, commonly known as the hidden-headed flax, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
