    "intro": "Cottsia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvet fern, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a soft texture that distinguishes it from other plants in the family. Cottsia species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover."
