    "intro": "Calonemorchis wanosa, commonly known as the Wanosa orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant blossoms. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, while its roots are adapted for epiphytic growth. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Calonemorchis wanosa is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
