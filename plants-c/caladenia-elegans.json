    "intro": "Caladenia elegans, commonly known as the Elegant Spider-Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathland and open forests, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears a single, strikingly colored orchid flower with a distinctive spider-like appearance. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellow with deep red or purple markings, and they bloom during late winter to early spring. Caladenia elegans is a protected species due to habitat loss and is often found in conservation reserves."
