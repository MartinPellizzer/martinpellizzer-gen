    "intro": "Camptosema rubicundum f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed form of the red-bellied camptosema, is a botanical variant characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. This subspecies exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical form, with foliage that is narrower and often more densely arranged. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically a shade of pink or red, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its unique foliage and delicate blooms make it a desirable choice for horticultural collections."
