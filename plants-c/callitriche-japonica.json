    "intro": "Callitriche japonica, commonly known as Japanese water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has small, floating leaves that are usually oval or heart-shaped, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences near the water's surface. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for small invertebrates and fish."
