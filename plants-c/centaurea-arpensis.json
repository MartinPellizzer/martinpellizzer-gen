    "intro": "Centaurea arpensis, commonly known as the Armenian star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and vibrant purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Centaurea arpensis is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, where it thrives in full sun."
