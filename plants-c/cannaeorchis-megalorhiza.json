    "intro": "Cannaeorchis megalorhiza, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, with vibrant purple petals and a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
