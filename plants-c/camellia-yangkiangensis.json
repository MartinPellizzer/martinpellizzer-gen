    "intro": "Camellia yangkiangensis, commonly known as the Yangkiangensis camellia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to China. It belongs to the Theaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and showy, camellia-like flowers. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, producing pink to red flowers that are highly ornamental. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
