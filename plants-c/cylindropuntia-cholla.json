    "intro": "Cylindropuntia cholla, commonly known as the cholla cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its branching, cylindrical stems that are segmented and covered in small, spine-tipped clusters called glochids. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its adaptive structure allows it to store water efficiently in arid environments. Cylindropuntia cholla is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance."
