    "intro": "Carex robusta, commonly known as the robust sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and is native to various regions of Europe and Asia. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of spike-like flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. Carex robusta thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for various wildlife species."
