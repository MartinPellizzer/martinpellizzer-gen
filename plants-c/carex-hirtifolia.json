    "intro": "Carex hirtifolia, commonly known as hairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, three-ranked flowers. Native to North America, it thrives in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in wetland environments. Its hairy texture on the leaves and stems is a distinguishing feature, contributing to its common name."
