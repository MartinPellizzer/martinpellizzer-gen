It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
