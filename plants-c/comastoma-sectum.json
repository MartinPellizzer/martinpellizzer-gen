    "intro": "Comastoma sectum, commonly known as the broken comastoma, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of other members of its family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
