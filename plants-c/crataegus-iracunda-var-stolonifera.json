    "intro": "Crataegus iracunda var. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping hawthorn, is a variant of the hawthorn genus characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit. It typically forms dense, low-lying mats or cushions, often spreading across rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are oval to lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. This variant is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
