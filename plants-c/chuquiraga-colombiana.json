    "intro": "Chuquiraga colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian chuquiraga, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as grasslands and shrublands, where it thrives in cooler, temperate climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers, which bloom in spring, are yellow or orange and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
