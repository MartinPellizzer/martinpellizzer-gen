    "intro": "Carex davalliana var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth and often crowded at the base, forming a dense clump. Its inflorescence consists of a single, cylindrical spike that bears small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland restoration projects."
