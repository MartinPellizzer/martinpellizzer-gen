    "intro": "Chamaesyce parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions, with a shallow root system and thick, water-storing leaves."
