    "intro": "Cuscuta nivea, commonly known as the white dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, white, funnel-shaped flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and can be found growing on a variety of plants, including crops and ornamental species. Its seeds are tiny and can remain viable in the soil for many years, making it a persistent weed. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked."
