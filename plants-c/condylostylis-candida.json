    "intro": "Condylostylis candida, commonly known as the white-flowered sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive blue to white ray florets and yellow disk florets. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal habitats, where it thrives in saline and well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
