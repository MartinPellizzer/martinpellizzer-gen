    "intro": "Cleisostoma mannii, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and pale green to white flowers that resemble ghosts, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Cleisostoma mannii is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
