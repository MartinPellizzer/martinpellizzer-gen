    "intro": "Cylindropuntia \u00d7 tetracantha, commonly known as the giant hedgehog cactus, is a hybrid species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are ribbed and covered in sharp, cylindrical spines. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and striking appearance."
