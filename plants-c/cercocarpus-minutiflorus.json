    "intro": "Cercocarpus minutiflorus, commonly known as the dwarf flax or low flax, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces distinctive, woody, cone-like fruits that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to its native habitat."
