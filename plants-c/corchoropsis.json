    "intro": "Corchoropsis, commonly known as wild cotton or desert cotton, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. The plant is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Corchoropsis species are often used in traditional medicine and for their fibrous seed pods, which have been utilized by indigenous communities for various purposes."
