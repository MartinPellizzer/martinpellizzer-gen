    "intro": "Columbaria cretica, commonly known as the Cretan columbaria, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Crete. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and features small, lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its historical significance and limited distribution, it is considered a botanically unique and ecologically valuable species."
