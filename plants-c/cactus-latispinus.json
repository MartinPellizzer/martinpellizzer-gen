    "intro": "Cactus latispinus, commonly known as the broad-spined cactus, is a species native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. Its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Cactus latispinus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
