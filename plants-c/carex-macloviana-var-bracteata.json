It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy along the edges. The varietal form bracteata is distinguished by the presence of bracts that are more prominent than in other varieties of Carex macloviana."
