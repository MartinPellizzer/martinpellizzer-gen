    "intro": "Carex maritima subsp. yukonensis, commonly known as Yukon sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to cold climates. Yukon sedge plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
