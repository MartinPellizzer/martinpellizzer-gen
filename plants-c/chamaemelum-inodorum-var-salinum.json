    "intro": "Chamaemelum inodorum var. salinum, commonly known as sea holly, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Europe and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils makes it a hardy species adapted to harsh maritime conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden landscapes."
