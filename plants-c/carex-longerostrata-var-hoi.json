    "intro": "Carex longerostrata var. hoi, commonly known as the Hoi sedge, is a variant of the long-beaked sedge native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. Its leaves are narrow and grassy, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in early to mid-summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
