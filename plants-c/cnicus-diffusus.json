    "intro": "Cnicus diffusus, commonly known as the spreading sow-thistle, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb characterized by its lobed, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, it thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has a taproot system and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
