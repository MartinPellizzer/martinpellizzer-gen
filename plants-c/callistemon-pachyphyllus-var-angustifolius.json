    "intro": "Callistemon pachyphyllus var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bottlebrush, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking red or pink bottlebrush-like flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract nectar-feeding birds and insects."
