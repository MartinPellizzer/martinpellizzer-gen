    "intro": "Carex lepidocarpa var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and clustered, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and wind-pollinated, with three stamens and a three-lobed pistil. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
