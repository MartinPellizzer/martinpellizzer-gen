    "intro": "[WRONG START] Codia stellifera, commonly known as the starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into the familiar star-shaped fruit. The fruit, known as carambola, has a distinctive five-lobed shape and is typically harvested when it turns yellow or orange. The plant is often cultivated for its edible fruit, which is rich in vitamin C and has a tart-sweet flavor. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
