    "intro": "Carex columbiana, commonly known as the Columbia sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex columbiana is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
