    "intro": "Colpodium versicolor, commonly known as the variable bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic or semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap microscopic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, and its leaves are often submerged. Colpodium versicolor exhibits a wide range of color variations in its flowers, which can range from white to pink and even purple. This plant is known for its unique method of nutrient acquisition through carnivory, supplementing its nutrient intake by capturing and digesting small aquatic animals."
