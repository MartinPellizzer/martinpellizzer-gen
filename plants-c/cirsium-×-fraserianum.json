    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 fraserianum, commonly known as the Fraser's thistle, is a hybrid plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in summer. Native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in forest edges. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
