    "intro": "Cypripedium calceolus proles triflorum, commonly known as the trifloral\u6753\u5170, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in high-altitude forests and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base of the plant. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
