It is a perennial herbaceous plant with a distinctive, showy flower that resembles a slipper, typically in shades of pink, white, or purple. The plant features a single, erect stem that can grow up to 60 cm tall, bearing a single, large, pouch-shaped lip. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette at the base, and it thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade. Cypripedium \u00d7 io is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
