    "intro": "Calymenia ovata, commonly known as the ovate calymenia, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Calymeniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, spore-bearing structures called calymena, which are typically found in fossil records. The plant is primarily known from its preserved remains in sedimentary rocks, indicating it thrived in ancient marine or coastal environments. Its morphology suggests it was a simple, non-vascular plant that played a role in early terrestrial ecosystems. Due to its rarity and limited fossil distribution, much of its botanical characteristics remain poorly understood."
