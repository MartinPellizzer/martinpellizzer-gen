    "intro": "Cerastium ligusticum f. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical species, and it produces clusters of white flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant collections and ecological restoration projects."
