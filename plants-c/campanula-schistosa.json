    "intro": "Campanula schistosa, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Campanula schistosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky garden settings."
