    "intro": "Cytinus hypocistis subsp. hypocistis, commonly known as the \"buttercup bur\" or \"crown vetch,\" is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, swollen base that resembles a cup or a bulb, which is a feature shared with other members of the genus Cytinus. The plant produces small, yellow to greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are typically trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can derive some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. This species is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, and it often grows in dry, rocky soils."
