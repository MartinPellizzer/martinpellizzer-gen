    "intro": "Campanula sibirica var. minor, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the colder regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early flowering and ability to attract pollinators."
