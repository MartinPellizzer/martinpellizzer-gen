    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 subspinuligerum, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Cirsium arvense (Canada thistle) and Cirsium vulgare (Common thistle). The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its foliage is covered with stiff, bristly hairs, and its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in many regions."
