    "intro": "Cissus sue, commonly known as the silver dollar plant, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with white or silver markings. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Cissus sue is often used in hanging baskets or as a climbing plant due to its vigorous growth habit."
