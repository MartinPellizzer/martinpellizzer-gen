    "intro": "Cyclanthera donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Donnell-Smith's bitterball, is a rare and unique member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, spiny fruit that resembles a small, green ball. The plant is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a rough texture, and it produces small, yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a critically endangered species."
