It is characterized by its climbing habit and showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer. Clematis ianthina prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental vines.
