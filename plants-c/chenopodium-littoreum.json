    "intro": "Chenopodium littoreum, commonly known as sea blite, is a halophyte plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid or coastal conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It is often found along shorelines, salt marshes, and other coastal habitats. Chenopodium littoreum is valued for its nutritional content and has been used in traditional cuisines."
