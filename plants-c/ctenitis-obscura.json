    "intro": "Ctenitis obscura, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in dense tropical forests. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ctenitis obscura is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
