    "intro": "Cristonia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cristonia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
