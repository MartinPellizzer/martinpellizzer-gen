It features compact, fleshy leaves that are often yellowish-green, arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
