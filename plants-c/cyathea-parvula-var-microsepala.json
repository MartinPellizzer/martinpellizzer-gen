    "intro": "Cyathea parvula var. microsepala, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a small, elegant fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact stature, with a short, sturdy trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that grow in a rosette pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in specialized structures called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
