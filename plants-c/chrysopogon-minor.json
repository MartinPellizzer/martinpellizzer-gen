    "intro": "Chrysopogon minor, commonly known as dwarf grass or lesser chrysopogon, is a small perennial grass native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering spikes are small and clustered, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Chrysopogon minor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
