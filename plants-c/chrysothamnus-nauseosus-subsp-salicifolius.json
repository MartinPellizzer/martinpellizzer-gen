    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus subsp. salicifolius, commonly known as the yellow rabbitbrush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and narrow, willow-like leaves, which give it its subspecific name. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and sagebrush steppe. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. The leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss."
