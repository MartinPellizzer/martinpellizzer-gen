    "intro": "Calanthe sieboldopsis, commonly known as the Siebold's calanthe, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features a sympodial growth habit with a pseudobulb that supports its foliage and flowers. The plant produces a single, showy raceme of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers during the spring season. Its leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid gardens."
