    "intro": "Cerastium arvense subsp. strictum, commonly known as the upright mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the leaves. Its leaves are typically spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
