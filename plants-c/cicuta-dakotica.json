    "intro": "Cicuta dakotica, commonly known as the Dakota water hemlock, is a toxic herbaceous plant native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It belongs to the parsley family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant contains potent toxins, primarily cicutoxin, which can cause severe poisoning in humans and animals. It typically grows in wet, disturbed soils along streambanks and roadsides. Due to its high toxicity, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
