It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and often have a rough, hairy texture. Its flowers are small, blue to purple, and arranged in loose clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Capsella lacerata is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, and it serves as a food source for various pollinators."
