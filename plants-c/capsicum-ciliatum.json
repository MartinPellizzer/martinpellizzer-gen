    "intro": "Capsicum ciliatum, commonly known as the woolly pepper or prickly pepper, is a species of chili pepper native to Mexico and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow or orange fruits that turn red as they mature. It thrives in warm, dry climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its mildly spicy fruit. Capsicum ciliatum is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants like tomatoes and potatoes."
