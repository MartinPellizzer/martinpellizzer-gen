    "intro": "Conyza canadensis, commonly known as horseweed, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers and finely divided, silvery-green leaves. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that allow it to spread easily in disturbed soils. It is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas where it can thrive in full sun. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
