It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of showy pink to purple flowers.

It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating adaptations to drought and high temperatures. Its fleshy leaves and deep root system help it conserve water and survive in harsh desert conditions."
