It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter, with a bluish-green hue and a fuzzy texture. The plant produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, spherical seed capsules. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its botanical characteristics make it an important plant for ecological studies and potential medicinal applications."
