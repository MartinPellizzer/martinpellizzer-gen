    "intro": "Cathedra caurensis, commonly known as the upright chair plant, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright, chair-like growth form, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise robust structure. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Cathedra caurensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
