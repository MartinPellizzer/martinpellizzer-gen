It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in catkins during the spring, followed by small, spiny fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
