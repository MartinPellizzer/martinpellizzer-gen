    "intro": "Cystium platytropis, commonly known as the broad-leafed thornapple, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems covered in small, sharp thorns. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by spherical, greenish fruits that turn red when mature. Its leaves are broad and oval-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and it is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Cystium platytropis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
