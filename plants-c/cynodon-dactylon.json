    "intro": "Cynodon dactylon, commonly known as Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and fine, narrow leaves. The plant has a rhizomatous and stolonal growth system, allowing it to spread rapidly and form a thick turf. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in a wide range of soil types. Due to its resilience, it is widely used for lawns, sports fields, and erosion control."
