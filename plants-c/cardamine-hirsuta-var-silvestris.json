    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. silvestris, commonly known as the hairy watercress, is a perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It features trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its often wet habitat. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
