    "intro": "Corylopsis spicata, commonly known as golden thread, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are highly fragrant and attract pollinators. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Corylopsis spicata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to bloom before many other spring-flowering plants."
