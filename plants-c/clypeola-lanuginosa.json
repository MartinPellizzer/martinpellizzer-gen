    "intro": "Clypeola lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly clypeola, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations in tropical ecosystems."
