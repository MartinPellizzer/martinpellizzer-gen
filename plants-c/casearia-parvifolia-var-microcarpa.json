It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by tiny, spherical fruits that are typically less than 5 mm in diameter. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its compact size and ornamental potential, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
