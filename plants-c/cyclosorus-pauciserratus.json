    "intro": "Cyclosorus pauciserratus, commonly known as the narrow-toothed water clover, is a rare and delicate aquatic fern native to freshwater environments in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, creeping rhizomes and delicate, heart-shaped fronds with finely serrated margins. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are usually found on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its propagation in moist habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
