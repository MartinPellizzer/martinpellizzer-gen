    "intro": "Cecropia sciadophylla, commonly known as the giant cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules, which helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It produces small, clustered flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. This species is also notable for its ability to form associations with ants, providing them with shelter in exchange for protection from herbivores."
