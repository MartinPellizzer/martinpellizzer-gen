It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Its roots are known for their medicinal properties, containing compounds with potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Capparis cuspidata is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and for the edible flowers and fruits it produces."
