    "intro": "Cycas lingshuigensis, commonly known as the Lingshuigou cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to southern China. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
