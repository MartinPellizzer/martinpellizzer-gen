    "intro": "Carex austriaca, commonly known as Austrian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil. Austrian sedge is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in wet conditions."
