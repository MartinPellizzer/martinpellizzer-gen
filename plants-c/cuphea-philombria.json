    "intro": "Cuphea philombria, commonly known as the flame beak plant, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Lythraceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red bracts that resemble beaks. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers clustered within the bracts, which are often more showy than the actual blooms. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Cuphea philombria is also valued for its ability to attract hummingbirds and other pollinators."
