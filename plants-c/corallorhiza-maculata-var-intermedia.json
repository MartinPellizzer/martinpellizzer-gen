    "intro": "Corallorhiza maculata var. intermedia, commonly known as the spotted coralroot, is an epiparasitic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is found in forested areas across eastern North America. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers with a distinctive corolla shape. It typically grows in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to its reliance on specific hosts and habitat conditions, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
