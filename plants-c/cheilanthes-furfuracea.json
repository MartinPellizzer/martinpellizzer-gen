It is a small, terrestrial plant characterized by its delicate, pale green to brownish leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. This plant is typically found growing on rocky outcrops and in arid environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself to rocky substrates. Cheilanthes furfuracea is notable for its ability to survive in harsh, dry conditions, making it a resilient and adaptive species."
