It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, woolly hair. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is often found in rocky, mountainous terrain where it forms dense, mat-like growths."
