    "intro": "Cynodon donax, commonly known as African grass or Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, the Americas, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in panicles. It is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of soil types and climates, making it a common invasive species in many regions. Cynodon donax is often used for erosion control and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and rapid growth."
