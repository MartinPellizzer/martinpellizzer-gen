    "intro": "Cyclosorus griffithianus, commonly known as the Griffith's waterwheel, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South Asia. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has a distinctive root system that helps stabilize the substrate and prevent erosion. Its reproductive structures are typically found in the water, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Due to habitat loss and pollution, Cyclosorus griffithianus is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
