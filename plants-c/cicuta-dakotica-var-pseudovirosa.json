    "intro": "Cicuta dakotica var. pseudovirosa, commonly known as the Dakota water hemlock, is a toxic plant native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and hollow, aromatic stems. The plant contains potent toxic compounds, primarily cicutoxin, which can be lethal to humans and animals if ingested. It typically grows in wet, disturbed soils along stream banks and roadside ditches. Its leaves are bipinnately compound, with finely divided, fern-like lobes that help distinguish it from similar species."
