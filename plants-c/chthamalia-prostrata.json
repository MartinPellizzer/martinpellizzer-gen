    "intro": "Chthamalia prostrata, commonly known as the creeping sea lettuce, is a species of green algae belonging to the family Ulvaceae. It is a marine plant that typically grows in shallow coastal waters, often on rocky substrates. The plant has a flattened, ribbon-like structure with a broad, smooth thallus that can vary in color from green to brownish depending on environmental conditions. It reproduces through sexual reproduction, producing gametes that fuse to form zygotes. Chthamalia prostrata plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
