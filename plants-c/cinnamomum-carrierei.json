    "intro": "Cinnamomum carrierei, commonly known as the Chinese cinnamon or Cinnamomum carri\u00e9re, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family. It is native to southern China, particularly in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, and thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. Its bark, similar to true cinnamon, contains essential oils and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. However, it is less commercially cultivated than other cinnamon species due to its limited yield and specific growing requirements."
