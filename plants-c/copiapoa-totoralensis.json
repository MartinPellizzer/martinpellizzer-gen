    "intro": "Copiapoa totoralensis, commonly known as the Totoral cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered with white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, which is a rare occurrence in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, adapting to extreme desert conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
