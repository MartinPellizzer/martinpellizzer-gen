    "intro": "Cleome simplicifolia, commonly known as the spider flower, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that resemble spider legs. The plant produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cleome simplicifolia thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in gardens. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
