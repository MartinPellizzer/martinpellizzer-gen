    "intro": "Caladium schomburgkii f. subrotundum, commonly known as the Crimson Blush caladium, is a striking ornamental plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that display vibrant shades of red, pink, and white. The foliage is the primary ornamental feature, as the plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and partial to full shade. This variety is popular in gardens and as a houseplant due to its bold, colorful leaf patterns."
