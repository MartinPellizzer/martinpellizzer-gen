    "intro": "Chimaphila maculata var. acuminata, commonly known as the spotted wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically spotted with white or yellow markings. The plant produces showy, tubular red or orange flowers in late winter to early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and flies. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in forest understories. This variety is closely related to other members of the Ericaceae family, sharing similar ecological and morphological traits."
