The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its unique floral structure includes a spurred lip that serves as a nectar source for pollinators. Coeloglossum lacertiferum is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats across its native range."
