    "intro": "Carlina corymbosa var. rothii, commonly known as the Roth's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered with dense, silvery-white hairs. The plant produces large, showy composite flowers, typically in shades of purple or blue, arranged in a corymb-like inflorescence. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with a rough, hairy texture, and often have a bluish-gray hue. This variant is notable for its adaptability to arid and high-altitude environments."
