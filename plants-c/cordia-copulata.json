    "intro": "Cordia copulata, commonly known as the red cedar or white cedar, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically glossy green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Cordia copulata is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline conditions, making it a resilient species in tropical environments. Its ornamental value and ecological importance contribute to its significance in both horticulture and natural ecosystems."
