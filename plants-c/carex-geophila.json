    "intro": "Carex geophila, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Carex geophila thrives in wet or damp soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
