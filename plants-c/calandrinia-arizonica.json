It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Calandrinia arizonica is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems."
