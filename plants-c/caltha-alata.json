    "intro": "Caltha alata, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wet meadows and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies."
