    "intro": "Celastrus lineatus, commonly known as the Indian bittersweet, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright orange to red berries. These berries are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds and animals. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it both useful in landscaping and a potential invasive species in some regions."
