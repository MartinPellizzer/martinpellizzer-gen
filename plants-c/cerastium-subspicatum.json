    "intro": "Cerastium subspicatum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, basal rosettes of velvety, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Cerastium subspicatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
