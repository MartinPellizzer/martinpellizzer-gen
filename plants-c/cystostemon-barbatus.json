It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
