    "intro": "Cynometra ramiflora, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to regions of Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often aromatic bark and alternate, simple leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by oval, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it useful in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some areas."
