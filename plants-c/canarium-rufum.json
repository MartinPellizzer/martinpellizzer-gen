    "intro": "Canarium rufum, commonly known as the red canarium, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into round, woody fruits containing a single, oily seed. The fruit's pulp is used in traditional medicine and as a source of edible oil, while the tree is also valued for its timber. Canarium rufum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
