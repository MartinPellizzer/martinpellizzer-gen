    "intro": "Ceanothus arcuatus, commonly known as the coastal ceanothus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline. The plant produces clusters of small, showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery or grayish underside, which helps reduce water loss in coastal conditions. Ceanothus arcuatus is adapted to the harsh, salty environment of the Pacific coast and is an important component of coastal scrub ecosystems."
