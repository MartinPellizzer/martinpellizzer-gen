    "intro": "Carex tauricola, commonly known as the Tauric sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, particularly the Caucasus region. This perennial herb typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
