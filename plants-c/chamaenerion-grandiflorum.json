It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking pink to red flowers in late summer. The plant has tall, erect stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. Fireweed thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in abandoned fields. It plays a role in ecological succession and provides nectar for pollinators."
