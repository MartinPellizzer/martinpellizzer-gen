    "intro": "Cardamine heterophylla, commonly known as the variable watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments in North America. It typically grows in shaded, wet areas such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant has alternate, trifoliate leaves that vary in shape depending on the environmental conditions. Its small, white flowers are arranged in terminal clusters and bloom in early spring. The plant is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
