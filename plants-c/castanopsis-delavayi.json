    "intro": "Castanopsis delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's tallowwood, is a deciduous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of southwest China. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, heavy wood. The plant produces small, cup-shaped fruits that contain one or two seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests at higher elevations. Castanopsis delavayi is valued for its ecological role and has limited commercial use due to its slow growth and hard wood."
