    "intro": "Ceratoides eversmanniana, commonly known as the big sagebrush, is a shrub native to North America, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green foliage and is often used in traditional medicine by Indigenous peoples. The plant has small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Ceratoides eversmanniana is also valued for its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
