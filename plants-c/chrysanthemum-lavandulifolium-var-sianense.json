    "intro": "Chrysanthemum lavandulifolium var. sianense, commonly known as the Sianese chrysanthemum, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, lavender-hued leaves that resemble those of lavender. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the autumn. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
