    "intro": "Claytonia parviflora subsp. viridis, commonly known as the green-flowered spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of broad, fleshy, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a dense inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cool, humid climates and nutrient-rich soils."
