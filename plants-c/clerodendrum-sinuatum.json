    "intro": "Clerodendrum sinuatum, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, red or orange calyces that resemble small lanterns, which are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. Clerodendrum sinuatum is often cultivated for its vibrant, showy bracts and is relatively easy to care for in warm climates."
