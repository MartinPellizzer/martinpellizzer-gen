    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe renilabia, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures are complex, with spores produced in specialized capsules on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Crocodeilanthe renilabia is considered a conservation concern."
