    "intro": "Cheilanthes auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often adorned with distinctive ear-shaped lobes. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically arranged in a continuous row. Cheilanthes auriculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry climates."
