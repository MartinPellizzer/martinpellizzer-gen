    "intro": "Crocus aerius, commonly known as the alpine crocus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its early blooming habit, often appearing in late winter or early spring before many other plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Crocus aerius is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible bulbs, though they are less commonly consumed than those of the saffron crocus."
