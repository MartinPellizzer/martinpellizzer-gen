It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth margin and a glossy surface. The fruit, a small cherry-like drupe, is edible but not as widely cultivated as other cherry species."
