    "intro": "Carex canescens var. lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, fens, and tundra environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually grayish-green in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is often found in nutrient-poor soils. This variety is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
