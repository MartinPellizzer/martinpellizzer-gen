    "intro": "Carex lyngbyei var. robusta, commonly known as the robust sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its erect, grass-like foliage and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinct midrib, while the flowers are usually greenish or brownish in color. This variety is noted for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
