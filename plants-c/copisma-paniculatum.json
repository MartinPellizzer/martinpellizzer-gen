    "intro": "Copisma paniculatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf false aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture, and its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in paniculate inflorescences. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in early successional plant communities."
