    "intro": "Centropogon warscewiczii, commonly known as the Warshawicz's centropogon, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Jamaica and the Bahamas. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
