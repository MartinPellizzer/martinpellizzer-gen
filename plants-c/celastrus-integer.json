    "intro": "Celastrus integer, commonly known as the prickly ash or sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its smooth, thorny stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its roots and bark have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Celastrus integer thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
