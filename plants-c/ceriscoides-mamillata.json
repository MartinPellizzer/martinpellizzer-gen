    "intro": "Ceriscoides mamillata, commonly known as the milkweed vine, is a tropical plant characterized by its climbing habit and distinctive foliage. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and prominent veins, which aid in photosynthesis and water retention. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, facilitating wind dispersal. Ceriscoides mamillata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests across Central and South America."
