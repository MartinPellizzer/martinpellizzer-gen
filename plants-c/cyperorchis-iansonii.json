    "intro": "Cyperorchis iansonii, commonly known as the Ianson's sedge orchid, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and delicate, orchid-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as montane forests and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cyperorchis iansonii is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
