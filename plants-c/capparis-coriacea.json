    "intro": "Capparis coriacea, commonly known as the rough caper, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems and oval, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by round, greenish fruits. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. The leaves and flowers are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
