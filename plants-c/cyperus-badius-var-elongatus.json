    "intro": "Cyperus badius var. elongatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgeland, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure makes it well-adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
