    "intro": "Calceolaria tripartita subsp. chumpitazii, commonly known as the Chumpitaz's slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant produces showy, bilaterally symmetrical blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
