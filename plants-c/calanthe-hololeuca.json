    "intro": "Calanthe hololeuca, commonly known as the white-lipped calanthe, is a perennial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers with prominent lips. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form compact clumps. Calanthe hololeuca is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts for its delicate floral display."
