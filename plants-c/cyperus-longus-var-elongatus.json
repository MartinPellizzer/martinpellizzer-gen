It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along water bodies. Its slender, grass-like stems are often found in dense clusters, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are narrow and linear, contributing to its distinctive appearance in wetland habitats."
