    "intro": "Cochemiea saboae, commonly known as the Saboae cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It typically grows to a height of about 10-15 centimeters and has a compact, globular shape with a shallow root system. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered at the top of the stem. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy, green stems. Cochemiea saboae is often grown in rock gardens or as a potted plant due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
