    "intro": "Conocarpus latifolius, commonly known as the buttonwood, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in mangrove ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it an important species in coastal stabilization and ecological restoration."
