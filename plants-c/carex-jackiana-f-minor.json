    "intro": "Carex jackiana f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf basket sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially sunny conditions. Its compact size makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in woodland settings. The inflorescence produces small, three-lobed flowers that are often greenish or brownish in color."
