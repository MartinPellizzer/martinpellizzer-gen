    "intro": "Cerastium diffusum var. palaui, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and alpine soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers with four petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are rounded and hairy, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. It is often found in rocky crevices and among scree slopes, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained environments."
