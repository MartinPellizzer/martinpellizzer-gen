    "intro": "Crossoglossa longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed cross-lip orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers with a distinctive cross-shaped lip, which is a defining feature of the orchid family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette. Crossoglossa longicaulis thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often growing in rocky or forested habitats."
