    "intro": "Crataegus nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-flowered hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge, giving it its \"naked-flowered\" appearance. These flowers are followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and open woods."
