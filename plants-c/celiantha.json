    "intro": "Celiantha, commonly known as the moonflower, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, white, nocturnal blossoms that open at night and close by dawn. The plant produces small, green, edible fruits that contain seeds covered in a fleshy, sticky coating. Celiantha thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique blooming pattern makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological studies."
