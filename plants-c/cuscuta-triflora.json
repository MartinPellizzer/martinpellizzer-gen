    "intro": "Cuscuta triflora, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
