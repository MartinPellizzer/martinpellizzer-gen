It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow inflorescences, which are clustered and resemble candles, giving it its common name. The seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
