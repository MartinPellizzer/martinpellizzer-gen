    "intro": "Colchicum wendelboi, commonly known as the Wendelbo's colchicum, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It produces striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive spurred petal, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has a short, thick rhizome that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and often withering before flowering. Colchicum wendelboi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
