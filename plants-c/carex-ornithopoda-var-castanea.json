    "intro": "Carex ornithopoda var. castanea, commonly known as the chestnut sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has narrow, sword-shaped leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. The chestnut sedge is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
