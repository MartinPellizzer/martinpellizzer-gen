    "intro": "Calophyllum canum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a glossy surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many regions."
