    "intro": "Carex capillaris subsp. krausei, commonly known as slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream edges. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in wetland environments. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
