    "intro": "Craterispermum caudatum, commonly known as the long-tailed rock cress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. Craterispermum caudatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments."
