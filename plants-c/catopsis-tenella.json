    "intro": "Catopsis tenella, commonly known as the miniature fern or baby's tears, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features delicate, bright green, thread-like fronds that grow in dense, carpet-like clusters. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shady, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Catopsis tenella is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its lush, foliage appearance."
