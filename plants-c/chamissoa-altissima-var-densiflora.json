    "intro": "Chamissoa altissima var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered chamissoa, is a perennial shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with finely textured leaves that provide a striking contrast to its bright yellow blooms. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant gardens. Its botanical features make it an important species for supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
