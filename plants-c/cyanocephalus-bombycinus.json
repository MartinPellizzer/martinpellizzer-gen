It is characterized by its striking blue flowers with a distinctive white throat, which are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. The plant features strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or pale green hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
