    "intro": "Cardamine africana var. allevia, commonly known as the African watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in racemes. Its roots are edible and have a peppery taste similar to watercress, making it a valuable plant in certain cuisines. It thrives in moist, shaded areas and is often found in streams, ponds, and wetlands across sub-Saharan Africa."
