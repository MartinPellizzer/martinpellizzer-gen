    "intro": "Coryphantha sneedii var. orcuttii, commonly known as the Orcutt's barrel cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Texas and Mexico. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 centimeters, featuring a globular or cylindrical stem that is ribbed and covered in a dense coating of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered at the base of the stem. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and relying on minimal rainfall. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and over-collection."
