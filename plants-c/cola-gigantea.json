    "intro": "Cola gigantea, commonly known as the giant cola, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to western Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that eventually develop into hard, woody pods containing stimulant-rich seeds. These seeds are the primary source of caffeine and are used in traditional medicine and as a stimulant. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts."
