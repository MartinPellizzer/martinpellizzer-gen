    "intro": "Cyathodes sulcata, commonly known as the Sulcate Cyathodes, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence, which consists of a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family, though it is mistakenly classified in Malvaceae. The plant features small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense cluster, with bracts that are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically simple, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Cyathodes sulcata is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
