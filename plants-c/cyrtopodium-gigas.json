    "intro": "Cyrtopodium gigas, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in variable conditions. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive, intricate pattern on the petals and sepals."
