It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a robust root system that helps it survive in arid environments. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
