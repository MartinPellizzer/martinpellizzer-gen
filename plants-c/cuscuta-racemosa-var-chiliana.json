    "intro": "Cuscuta racemosa var. chiliana, commonly known as the Chilean dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. The plant has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host, forming a dense network. It is native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina, and thrives in dry, arid environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively."
