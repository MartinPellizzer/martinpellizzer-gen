It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a composite head, and it produces fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Conyza longissima is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
