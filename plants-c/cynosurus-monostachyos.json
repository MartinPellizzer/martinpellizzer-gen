    "intro": "Cynosurus monostachyos, commonly known as narrowleaf hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, dunes, and wetlands. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-bearing flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture. Cynosurus monostachyos is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
