    "intro": "Cactus chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese cactus or the tree cactus, is a species native to China. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Cactus chinensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
