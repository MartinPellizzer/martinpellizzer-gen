    "intro": "Cyperus pygmaeus var. michelianus, commonly known as the dwarf sedgeland sedge, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its low maintenance and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping."
