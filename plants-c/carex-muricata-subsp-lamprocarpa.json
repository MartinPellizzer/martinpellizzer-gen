    "intro": "Carex muricata subsp. lamprocarpa, commonly known as the glossy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that have a glossy appearance. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
