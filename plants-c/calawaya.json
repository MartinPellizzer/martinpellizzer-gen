    "intro": "Calawaya, commonly known as the \"Philippine rose\" or *Hibiscus tiliaceus*, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, including the Philippines. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white, with a yellow center. Calawaya thrives in coastal areas and is often found along shorelines, where it helps stabilize the soil. Its flowers are not only ornamental but also used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
