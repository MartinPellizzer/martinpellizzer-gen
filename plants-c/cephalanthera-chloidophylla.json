    "intro": "Cephalanthera chloidophylla, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy yellow flower that blooms in late spring. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its underground roots. Its habitat is typically moist, shaded woodlands, where it thrives in rich, loamy soils. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
