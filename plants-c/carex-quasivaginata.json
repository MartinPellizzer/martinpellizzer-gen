    "intro": "Carex quasivaginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. Native to eastern North America, it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant produces spikelets that are typically green to brown in color, and it is often found in association with other sedges and wetland flora. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
