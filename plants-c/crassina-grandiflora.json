    "intro": "Crassina grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered crassina, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences that produce numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive floral display."
