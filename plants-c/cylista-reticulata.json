    "intro": "Cylista reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined cycad, is a unique species of cycad native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of waxy, scale-like structures. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones developing on separate plants. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and for ornamental purposes due to their striking appearance. The species is also of interest to botanists due to its ancient lineage and ecological significance in tropical ecosystems."
