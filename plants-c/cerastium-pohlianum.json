    "intro": "Cerastium pohlianum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Cerastium pohlianum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
