    "intro": "Chamaedrys lucida, commonly known as evergreen arnica, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, leathery, dark green leaves that are covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used traditionally for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
