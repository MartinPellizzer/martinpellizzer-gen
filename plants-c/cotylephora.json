    "intro": "Cotylephora, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are characterized by their distinctive, often spiny, leaves and small, yellowish flowers. Cotylephora species are adapted to saline environments, which allows them to thrive in regions with high salt content. They play an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms. The genus includes several species, each with unique morphological features that aid in their survival in harsh maritime conditions."
