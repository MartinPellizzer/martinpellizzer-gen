It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces dark, berry-like seeds that are dispersed by water. Carex atratiformis plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
