    "intro": "Calothamnus nodosus, commonly known as the nodding glory bush, is a small shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage of narrow, evergreen leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange, arranged in clusters along the stems. These flowers are adapted for pollination by birds and insects, with their bright colors and nectar-rich structures. Calothamnus nodosus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
