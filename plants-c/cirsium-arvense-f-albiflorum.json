It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and showy white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its flowers are typically borne in a dense, spherical head, and the plant is known for its robust growth habit. The whiteflower thistle is also noted for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it an invasive species in many regions."
