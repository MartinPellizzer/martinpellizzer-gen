    "intro": "Caltha palustris var. cornuta, commonly known as the horned marsh marigold, is a variant of the marsh marigold native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, horn-like sepals that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
