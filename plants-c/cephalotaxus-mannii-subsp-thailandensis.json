    "intro": "Cephalotaxus mannii subsp. thailandensis, commonly known as the Thai yew, is a rare and endangered coniferous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and distinctive, narrow, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange aril. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
