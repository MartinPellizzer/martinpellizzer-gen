    "intro": "Convolvulus nodiflorus var. deglabratus, commonly known as the smoothleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a climbing vine characterized by its slender stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in the morning, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in grassy areas and along fences. Due to its ornamental value and invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant."
