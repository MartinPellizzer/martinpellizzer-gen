    "intro": "Coccocypselum buxifolium, commonly known as the box-leaf coccocypselum, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive foliage, which consists of small, rounded, leathery leaves that resemble those of boxwood. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are a source of food for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
