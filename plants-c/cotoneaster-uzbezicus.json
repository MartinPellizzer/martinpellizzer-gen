    "intro": "Cotoneaster uzbezicus, commonly known as the Central Asian cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features small, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Cotoneaster uzbezicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature and seasonal color changes."
