    "intro": "Calamagrostis dubia, commonly known as the slender false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is characterized by its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in waterlogged soils. Calamagrostis dubia plays a role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
