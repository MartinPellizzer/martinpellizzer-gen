    "intro": "Cactus subulifer, commonly known as the needle-cushion cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, spine-like structures that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a short, thick stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and bloom during the warmer months. The cactus is adapted to thrive in high sunlight and low rainfall conditions."
