    "intro": "Cheilanthes commutata, commonly known as the fringed rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as cliffs and slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This species is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
