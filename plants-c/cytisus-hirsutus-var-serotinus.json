    "intro": "Cytisus hirsutus var. serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its yellow flowers that bloom later in the season compared to other cytisus species. The plant has slender, thornless stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and dry garden environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen, benefiting surrounding plants."
