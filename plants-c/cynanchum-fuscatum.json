    "intro": "Cynanchum fuscatum, commonly known as the black milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes other milkweeds known for their latex-like sap. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and have a slightly rough texture. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and are usually greenish-white with a subtle fragrance. The plant produces small, dry fruits called follicles, which contain seeds with silky hairs for wind dispersal."
