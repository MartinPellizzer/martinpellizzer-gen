    "intro": "Clematis pitcheri var. sargentii, commonly known as the Sargent's Clematis, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a valuable addition to native gardens. Its foliage consists of palmately compound leaves, which are finely divided and contribute to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
