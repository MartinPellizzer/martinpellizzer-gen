It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
