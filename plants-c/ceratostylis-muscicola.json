    "intro": "Ceratostylis muscicola, commonly known as the moss orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often among mosses and leaf litter. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its roots are often symbiotic with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
