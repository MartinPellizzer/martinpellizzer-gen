    "intro": "Cremastra aphylla, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and fascinating member of the nightshade family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is notable for its unique, bell-shaped flowers that resemble small, ghostly faces, hence its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
