    "intro": "Camelina foetida var. ambigua, commonly known as the foul-smelling camelina, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the camelina species. It is a herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and distinctive, often pungent odor, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
