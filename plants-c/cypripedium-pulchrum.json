    "intro": "Cypripedium pulchrum, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, which is a distinctive feature of the orchid family. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without being exposed to direct sunlight. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with a complex structure that plays a role in pollination by insects. Cypripedium pulchrum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also of interest in botanical research due to its ecological and evolutionary significance."
