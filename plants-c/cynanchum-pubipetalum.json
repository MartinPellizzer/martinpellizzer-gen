    "intro": "Cynanchum pubipetalum, commonly known as the hairy petal milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Cynanchum pubipetalum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils."
