    "intro": "Claoxylon nigtanig, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in brackish water environments. The plant has opposite, simple, and elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing several seeds. This species plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
