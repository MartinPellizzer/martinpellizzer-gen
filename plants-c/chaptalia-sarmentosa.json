    "intro": "Chaptalia sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping chaptalia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and often aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often forming dense mats due to its sprawling, prostrate growth habit. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Chaptalia sarmentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
