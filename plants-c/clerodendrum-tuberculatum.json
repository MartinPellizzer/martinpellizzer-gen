    "intro": "Clerodendrum tuberculatum, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often reddish-barked trunk and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers followed by orange-red fruits that split open to reveal edible seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in medicine and as a source of natural dyes. Its growth habit and foliage make it a popular choice for garden landscaping in warm climates."
