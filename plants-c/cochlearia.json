    "intro": "Cochlearia, commonly known as the mouse-ear cress, is a genus of flowering plants in the Brassicaceae family. These plants are typically small, herbaceous, and often have hairy leaves that resemble mouse ears, hence their common name. They are found in various habitats, including coastal areas, meadows, and rocky soils, across the Northern Hemisphere. Cochlearia species produce small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The genus includes around 100 species, many of which are characterized by their distinctive leaf morphology and ecological adaptability."
