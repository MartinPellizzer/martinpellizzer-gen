    "intro": "Cyathopappus gnephosioides, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. The plant has a low-growing, sprawling habit with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its scientific name reflects its unique floral structure, which includes a cyathium\u2014a cup-like arrangement of bracts and flowers. This species is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often relying on seasonal rainfall for growth and reproduction."
