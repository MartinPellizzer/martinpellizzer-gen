It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to white, often with a distinctive lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Cattleya liliastrum is prized for its ornamental value and is popular in horticulture for its beauty and fragrance."
