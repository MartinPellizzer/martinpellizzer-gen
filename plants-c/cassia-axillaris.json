    "intro": "Cassia axillaris, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a small, woody shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by long, narrow pods. Cassia axillaris is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of garden environments."
