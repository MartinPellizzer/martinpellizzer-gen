    "intro": "Carex inconspicua, commonly known as the common sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and wet meadows. The plant has triangular, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil in wetland environments. Carex inconspicua is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
