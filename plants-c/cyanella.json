    "intro": "Cyanella, commonly known as the sea onion or sea garlic, is a genus of flowering plants in the Amaryllidaceae family. These plants are native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Cyanella species are characterized by their narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pink flowers. They are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and can be cultivated in coastal gardens. The bulbs of some species are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor."
