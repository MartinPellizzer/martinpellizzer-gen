    "intro": "Carex gigantea, commonly known as the giant sedge, is a tall, grass-like perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features dense, cylindrical inflorescences that produce small, greenish flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bright green and can grow up to several feet in height. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Carex gigantea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
