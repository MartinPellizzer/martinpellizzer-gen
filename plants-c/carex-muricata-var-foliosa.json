    "intro": "Carex muricata var. foliosa, commonly known as the broad-leaved bulrush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with broad, flat leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces spikes of small, greenish-brown flowers that are typically clustered at the top of the stems. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
