    "intro": "Cacalia tomentella, commonly known as the woolly cacalia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Cacalia tomentella is a perennial herb that is relatively uncommon and of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphology."
