It features striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in the autumn, typically from September to November. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm, which serves as its primary storage organ. Its flowers are tubular and have a distinctive spurred petal, typical of the Colchicaceae family. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates."
