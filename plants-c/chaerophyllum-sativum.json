    "intro": "Chaerophyllum sativum, commonly known as cow parsley, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been naturalized in other regions. The plant is not only ornamental but also serves as a food source for various pollinators."
