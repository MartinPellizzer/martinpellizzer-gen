    "intro": "Cardamine dentata subsp. nasturtiifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant features trifoliate leaves with finely toothed margins and small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
