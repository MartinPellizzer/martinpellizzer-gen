It is characterized by its spiny stems and oval, dark green leaves with a slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to edible, orange-red berries. These berries are rich in vitamin C and have a tart, slightly sweet flavor. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of fruit in tropical and subtropical regions."
