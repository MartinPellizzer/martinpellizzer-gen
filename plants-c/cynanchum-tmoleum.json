    "intro": "Cynanchum tmoleum, commonly known as blue milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Cynanchum tmoleum plays a role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
