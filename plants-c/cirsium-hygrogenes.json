    "intro": "Cirsium hygrogenes, commonly known as the swamp thistle, is a perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, leafy stems and large, purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in marshes, pond edges, and other moist environments, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Cirsium hygrogenes plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
