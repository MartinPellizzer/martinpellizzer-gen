It is characterized by its tall, trunk-like stem covered in persistent, scale-like remnants of old leaves. The fronds are large, pinnately compound, and have a distinctive, elongated shape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. The plant plays a role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
