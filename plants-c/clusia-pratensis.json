    "intro": "Clusia pratensis, commonly known as the marsh clusia, is a shrub native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in areas with poor drainage. Clusia pratensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
