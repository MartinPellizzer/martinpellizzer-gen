    "intro": "Cereus tineoi, commonly known as the Tineo's night bloomer, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that open at night, emitting a fragrant scent to attract pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system to access water in dry conditions. Cereus tineoi is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a striking addition to xeriscaped gardens."
