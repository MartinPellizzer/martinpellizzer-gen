    "intro": "Camphora procera, commonly known as the giant camphor tree, is a large evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and broad, ovate leaves that are glossy on top and dull beneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by egg-shaped, woody fruits. Its leaves and bark contain camphor, a volatile oil used in traditional medicine and as a preservative. Camphora procera is also valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in its native habitats."
