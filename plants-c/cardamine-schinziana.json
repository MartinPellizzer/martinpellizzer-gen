    "intro": "Cardamine schinziana, commonly known as the Schinz's water shield, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often near the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are usually heart-shaped or rounded, with a waxy surface to repel water. Its flowers are small and white, often arranged in clusters, and it produces tiny, capsule-like fruits. Cardamine schinziana is valued for its role in aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
