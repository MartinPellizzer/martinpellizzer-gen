    "intro": "Campylocentrum rimbachii, commonly known as the Rimbach\u2019s cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. Native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. It produces small, spherical cones that are typically pollinated by specific insects, a process that is crucial for its reproductive success. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Campylocentrum rimbachii is considered critically endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
