    "intro": "Cheirolophus satarataensis subsp. dariasii, commonly known as the Darias' tansy, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in dry and sunny habitats. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, tubular florets arranged in a compact cluster. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
