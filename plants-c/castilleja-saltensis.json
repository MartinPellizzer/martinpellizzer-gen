    "intro": "Castilleja saltensis, commonly known as the saltbush castilleja, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reduced leaves and specialized root system that allows it to attach to host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers, typically in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or saline soils, often found in association with shrubs like Artemisia. Due to its ecological role and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
