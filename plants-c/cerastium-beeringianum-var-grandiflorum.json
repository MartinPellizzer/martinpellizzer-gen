    "intro": "Cerastium beeringianum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the Arctic mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a mat-forming growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
