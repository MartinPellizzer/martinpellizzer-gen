    "intro": "Conceveiba belizensis, commonly known as the Belize veveiba, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly Belize. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks and in dense tropical forests. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers bloom in vibrant shades of red and orange. Due to habitat loss, Conceveiba belizensis is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
