    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri f. witasekiana, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
