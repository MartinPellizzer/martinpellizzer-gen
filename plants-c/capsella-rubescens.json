It is an annual herb that grows up to 30 cm tall, featuring upright stems that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, oval-shaped seeds. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Capsella rubescens is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
