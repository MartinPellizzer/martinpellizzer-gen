    "intro": "Cardamine corydaloides, commonly known as the clustered watercress, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a small herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a serrated edge and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. The plant is often found in calcareous soils and is characterized by its peppery taste, similar to that of watercress."
