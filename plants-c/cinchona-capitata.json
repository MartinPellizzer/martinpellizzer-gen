    "intro": "Cinchona capitata, commonly known as the clustered quinine tree, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain elliptical seeds, and its leaves are typically ovate with a slightly serrated margin. Cinchona capitata is notable for its historical use in the production of quinine, though it is less commercially significant than other cinchona species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests."
