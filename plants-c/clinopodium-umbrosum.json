    "intro": "Clinopodium umbrosum, commonly known as shadow mint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes, where it forms dense mats of foliage. The plant has slender, aromatic leaves with a mint-like scent, and its small, pale blue or purple flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Clinopodium umbrosum is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses."
