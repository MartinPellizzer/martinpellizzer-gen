    "intro": "Celtis guineensis var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, greyish-brown bark. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, and they are smaller than those of the typical C. guineensis. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in panicles, followed by small, round, greenish fruits that mature to a dark blue or black color. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including forests and woodland areas."
