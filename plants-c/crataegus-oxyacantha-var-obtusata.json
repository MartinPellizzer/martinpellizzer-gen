    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha var. obtusata, commonly known as the blunt-leaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its oval, leathery leaves that are broader and more rounded compared to typical hawthorn species. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. The variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
