    "intro": "Campanula littoralis, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along sea shores, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to the harsh coastal environment. Campanula littoralis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
