    "intro": "Carex setigera var. fascicularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or moderately wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, or along stream banks. Its botanical structure makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
