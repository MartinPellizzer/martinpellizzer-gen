It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually densely clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its fruits are small drupes that turn red when mature. Connarus oligophyllus is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental foliage."
