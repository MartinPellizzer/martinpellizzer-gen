    "intro": "Chiloglottis sphaerula, commonly known as the spherical female orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, globular shape and is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests. The plant produces a single, showy white or pale green flower that resembles a small sphere, which is a distinctive feature of the genus Chiloglottis. It has a short, underground rhizome and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
