    "intro": "Carex saxatilis var. miliaris, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate harsh conditions, including cold temperatures and low nutrient levels. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in naturalized settings."
