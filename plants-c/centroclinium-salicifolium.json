    "intro": "Centroclinium salicifolium, commonly known as the willow-leaf centroclinium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to the eastern United States, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of willow trees. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in umbrella-like clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Centroclinium salicifolium is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in its native habitat."
