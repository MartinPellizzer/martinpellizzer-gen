    "intro": "Caprifolium douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically reddish beneath and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, appearing in early summer. These flowers give way to red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
