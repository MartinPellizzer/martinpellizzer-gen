    "intro": "Ctenopteris venulosoides, commonly known as the veiny sea holly, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound fronds that are often covered in fine, veiny patterns. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or rocky substrates. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to anchor in shallow marine environments. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a notable coastal vegetation species."
