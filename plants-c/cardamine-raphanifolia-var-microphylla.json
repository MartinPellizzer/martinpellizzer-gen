    "intro": "Cardamine raphanifolia var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which attract pollinators such as bees. Its roots are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to watercress. This variety is typically found in moist, calcareous soils near streams and ponds."
