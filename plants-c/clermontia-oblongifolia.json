    "intro": "Clermontia oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf clermonthe, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. It has broad, elliptical leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Clermontia oblongifolia is considered a rare and endangered species."
