    "intro": "Carex meyeriana, commonly known as Meyer's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps, making it a popular choice for wetland restoration and ornamental gardening. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, providing aesthetic value in both natural and cultivated landscapes."
