    "intro": "Ceropteris stiibelii, commonly known as the Stiibel's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense underwater mats. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the water fern family. Ceropteris stiibelii plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for various aquatic organisms."
