    "intro": "Coleus scandens, commonly known as the creeping coleus, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful leaves that come in shades of red, pink, and purple, often with contrasting green veins. The plant is a trailing or climbing herb that thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright, indirect light. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, though they are not the main ornamental feature. Coleus scandens is popular as a houseplant and is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover in gardens."
