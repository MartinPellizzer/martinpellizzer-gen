    "intro": "Cassia flexuosa, commonly known as the weeping cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, and its compound leaves are typically pinnate with a feathery structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, rectangular seeds. Cassia flexuosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes. Its botanical features make it both visually striking and ecologically valuable in its native habitats."
