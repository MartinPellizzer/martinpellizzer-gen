    "intro": "Cistus oleifolius, commonly known as the Spanish rock rose, is a flowering shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss, and it produces a distinctive, aromatic resin. The plant is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
