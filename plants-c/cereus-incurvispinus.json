    "intro": "Cereus incurvispinus, commonly known as the twisted spine cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its adaptations include succulent stems for water storage and a nocturnal blooming cycle to conserve moisture. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for arid garden environments."
