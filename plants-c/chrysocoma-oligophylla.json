It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and woody, aromatic bark. The plant is known for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used for construction and tool-making. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland and savanna habitats. Chrysocoma oligophylla also produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by animals."
