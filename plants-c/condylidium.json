    "intro": "Condylidium, commonly known as the horned liverwort, is a genus of non-vascular plants belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. These plants are typically small, mat-forming, and thrive in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Their structure includes a thallus with distinct lobes and often features specialized structures called gemmae for asexual reproduction. Condylidium species are characterized by their ability to retain water and their simple yet efficient mechanisms for nutrient absorption. They play a role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for microorganisms in their ecosystems."
