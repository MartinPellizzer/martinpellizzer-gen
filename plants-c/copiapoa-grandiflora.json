    "intro": "Copiapoa grandiflora, commonly known as the giant copiapoa, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Copiapoa grandiflora is also known for its slow growth rate and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
