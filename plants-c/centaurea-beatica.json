    "intro": "Centaurea beatica, commonly known as the Beaufort thistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and bright blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across rocky and alpine habitats. Centaurea beatica is often found in open, sunny areas with poor soil, demonstrating its adaptability to harsh environments. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect it from herbivores."
