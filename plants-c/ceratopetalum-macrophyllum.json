    "intro": "Ceratopetalum macrophyllum, commonly known as the mountain snowbush, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are simple, opposite, and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with five petals that are fused at the base, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
