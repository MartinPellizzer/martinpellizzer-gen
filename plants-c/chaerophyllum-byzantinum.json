It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, compound leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is native to regions of Europe and Asia. Due to its potential to spread rapidly, it is considered a weed in some areas."
