    "intro": "Cerasus juliana var. praecox, commonly known as the early Japanese cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom early in the spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, sweet, and tart cherries that are edible but not as large or flavorful as those of other cherry species. It is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its showy blossoms and is also valued in traditional Japanese culture. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
