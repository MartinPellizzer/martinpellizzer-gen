    "intro": "Colymbada spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, water-filled bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise above the water surface. Colymbada spinulosa is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
