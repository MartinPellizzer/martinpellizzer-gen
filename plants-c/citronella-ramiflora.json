    "intro": "Citronella ramiflora, commonly known as the creeping citronella, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in wet, tropical climates and is often found in marshy or swampy areas. Its essential oils, particularly citronellol and geraniol, are widely used in insect repellents. Due to its strong scent, it is also used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and calming properties."
