    "intro": "Cyathea singularis, commonly known as the singular tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in dense, spore-producing clusters called sori on the underside of the fronds. Cyathea singularis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to humid, tropical environments."
