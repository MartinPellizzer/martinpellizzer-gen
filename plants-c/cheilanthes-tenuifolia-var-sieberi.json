    "intro": "Cheilanthes tenuifolia var. sieberi, commonly known as the Sieber's slender rock fern, is a hardy, evergreen fern native to arid and rocky environments in North America. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rock faces or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to survive in harsh, low-moisture conditions."
