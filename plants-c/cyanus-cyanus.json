    "intro": "Cyanus cyanus, commonly known as the blueweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Cyanus cyanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
