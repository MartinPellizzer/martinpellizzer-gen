    "intro": "Cassipourea gummiflua var. ugandensis, commonly known as the Ugandan gum tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to central and eastern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
