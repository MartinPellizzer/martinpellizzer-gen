    "intro": "Cymbopogon reflexus, commonly known as narrowleaf lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Cymbopogon reflexus is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils due to its aromatic properties."
