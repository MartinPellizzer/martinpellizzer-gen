It features delicate, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. It is often found in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Calytrix praecipua is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fragrant, showy blooms."
