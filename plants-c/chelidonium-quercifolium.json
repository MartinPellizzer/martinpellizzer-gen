    "intro": "Chelidonium quercifolium, commonly known as the oak-leaved greater celandine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of an oak tree. The plant produces bright yellow, saucer-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots and rhizomes contain alkaloids, making it a plant with historical use in traditional medicine. However, it is toxic and should be handled with care."
