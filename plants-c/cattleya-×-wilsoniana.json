    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 wilsoniana, commonly known as the Wilson's Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, fragrant, and showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil, and it requires high humidity and bright, indirect light. Cattleya \u00d7 wilsoniana is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
