It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
