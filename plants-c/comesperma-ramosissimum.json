    "intro": "Comesperma ramosissimum, commonly known as the coastal honeysuckle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and its woody stems are often branched and somewhat thorny. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
