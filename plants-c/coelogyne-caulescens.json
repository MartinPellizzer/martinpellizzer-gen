It features a short, stocky rhizome and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has long, strap-like leaves and often blooms during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Coelogyne caulescens is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
