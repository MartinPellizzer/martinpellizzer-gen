    "intro": "Codonoboea alternans, commonly known as the mountain morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, which includes many species of morning glories. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is often found in moist, shaded areas within cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific growing conditions to flourish."
