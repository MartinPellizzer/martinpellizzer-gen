    "intro": "Cocos \u00d7 campos-portoana, commonly known as the hybrid coconut palm, is a naturally occurring hybrid between *Cocos nucifera* and *Euterpe oleracea*. It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, combining the tall, slender trunk of the coconut palm with the broader leaves of the a\u00e7a\u00ed palm. The plant produces both coconut-like fruits and a\u00e7a\u00ed-like berries, making it unique in its fruit morphology. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas with well-drained soils. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically cultivated for commercial purposes but is of interest in botanical research."
