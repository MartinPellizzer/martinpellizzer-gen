It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters and features alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces catkin-like male flowers and female flowers that develop into small, edible nuts enclosed in a cupule. Its botanical features include smooth, dark brown bark and clusters of yellowish-green catkins in the spring. Corylus pumila is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
