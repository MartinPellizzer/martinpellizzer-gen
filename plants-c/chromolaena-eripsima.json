    "intro": "Chromolaena eripsima, commonly known as the flame bush, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common ornamental plant in warm climates. However, it can become invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds."
