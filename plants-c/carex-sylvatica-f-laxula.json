It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often more loosely arranged compared to the typical form. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are usually greenish or reddish in color. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
