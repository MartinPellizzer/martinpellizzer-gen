    "intro": "Cattleya labiata var. mossiae, commonly known as the Mossia's Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its vibrant, showy flowers. It features large, butterfly-shaped blooms in shades of pink, white, and lavender, often with a distinctive lip that is more pronounced than in other varieties. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants rather than in soil, and it thrives in warm, humid environments. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media to flourish. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively ease of cultivation."
