    "intro": "Chaerophyllum shortii, commonly known as the Sierra bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
