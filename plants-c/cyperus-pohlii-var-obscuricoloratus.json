    "intro": "Cyperus pohlii var. obscuricoloratus, commonly known as the dark-stemmed flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, thriving in shallow water or saturated soil. Its stems are usually dark green to purple, and the leaves are narrow with a slightly rough texture. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters, and are pollinated by wind rather than insects."
