    "intro": "Coelogyne hosei, commonly known as the Hoser's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender pseudobulbs and long, arching inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Its flowers are noted for their intricate petal structure and subtle fragrance, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Coelogyne hosei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
