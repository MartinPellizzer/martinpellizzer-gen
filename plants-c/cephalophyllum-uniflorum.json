    "intro": "Cephalophyllum uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower headplant, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and its striking, single flower that emerges from a central stem. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive, helmet-like shape that gives the plant its genus name. Cephalophyllum uniflorum is adapted to arid environments, featuring thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss."
