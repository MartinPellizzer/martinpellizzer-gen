It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads composed of many tiny florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201390 cm, with slender, branched stems and feathery, aromatic leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow and bloom from June to August. Yarrow is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
