    "intro": "Carex subtransversa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and a dense cluster of spikelets at the top. Native to moist, temperate regions, it thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
