    "intro": "Cereus montevidensis, commonly known as the Montevideo Cactus, is a flowering cactus native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, covered in sharp, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that are typically borne at the top of the stems. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cereus montevidensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to bloom under specific conditions."
