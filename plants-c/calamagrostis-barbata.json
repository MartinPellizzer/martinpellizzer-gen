    "intro": "Calamagrostis barbata, commonly known as the tufted feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and feathery, silver-green foliage that adds ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers in late summer, which contribute to its decorative appeal. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and marshy areas. Calamagrostis barbata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
