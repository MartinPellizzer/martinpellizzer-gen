    "intro": "Coffea benghalensis var. benghalensis, commonly known as the Indian coffee or Bengal coffee, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Indian subcontinent. It typically grows to a height of about 2-3 meters and has glossy, dark green leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, white flowers that give way to red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee. The berries are usually harvested when they turn bright red, and the seeds are roasted and ground to make coffee. It is primarily cultivated for its aromatic and flavorful coffee beans, which are appreciated in specialty coffee markets."
