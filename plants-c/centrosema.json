    "intro": "Centrosema, commonly known as the sicklepod or velvet bean, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their trifoliate leaves and clustered flowers. Centrosema species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. They are known for their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making them valuable in agricultural systems. The seeds of some species are used as a protein-rich food source, while others are used in traditional medicine."
