    "intro": "Cousinia chaetocephala, commonly known as the woolly cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, mountainous areas. Cousinia chaetocephala is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
