    "intro": "Cleistogenes longiflora, commonly known as the long-flower bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and loamy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous blue to purple flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Cleistogenes longiflora is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, making it an important component of native grassland ecosystems. Its adaptability and ecological significance make it a valuable species for conservation and restoration efforts."
