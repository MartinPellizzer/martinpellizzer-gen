    "intro": "Cyathea microdonta, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and distinctive fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting the growth of its tall, slender trunk. The fronds are bi-directionally arranged, contributing to its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
