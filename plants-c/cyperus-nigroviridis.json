    "intro": "Cyperus nigroviridis, commonly known as blackstem flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like stems with narrow, pointed leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas or along waterways. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
