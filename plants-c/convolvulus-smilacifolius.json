    "intro": "Convolvulus smilacifolius, commonly known as the creeping woodbine, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in certain environments."
