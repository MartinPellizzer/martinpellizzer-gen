    "intro": "Cyclosorus wangii, commonly known as the Wang's cyclosorus, is a rare and enigmatic fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricately veined fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its unique morphology includes a compact rosette of leaves with a distinctive, circular arrangement. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus wangii is considered a species of conservation concern."
