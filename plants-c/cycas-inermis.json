    "intro": "Cycas inermis, commonly known as the spinless cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a dioecious plant, meaning that male and female reproductive structures are found on separate plants. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk with a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. It produces cones, with male cones being yellow and female cones being green and woody. Cycas inermis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
