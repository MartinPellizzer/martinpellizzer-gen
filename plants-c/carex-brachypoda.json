    "intro": "Carex brachypoda, commonly known as narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, clustered flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex brachypoda is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
