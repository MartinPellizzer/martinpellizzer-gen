    "intro": "Carduus fasciculiflorus, commonly known as the clustered thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and large, purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in the summer. The plant produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits that contain a single seed. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with rough, serrated edges and a thick, waxy coating. Carduus fasciculiflorus is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
