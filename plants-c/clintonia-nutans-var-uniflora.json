    "intro": "Clintonia nutans var. uniflora, commonly known as the nodding white bellflower, is a rare and delicate perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Melanthiaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, nodding white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and grows in moist, shaded woodlands, often in rich, loamy soils. Its flowers are typically borne on short, erect stems and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
