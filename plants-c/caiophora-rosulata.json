    "intro": "Caiophora rosulata, commonly known as the Rosulate Caiophora, is a unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are arranged in dense clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid environment. Caiophora rosulata is also notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a rare and sought-after species among botanical enthusiasts."
