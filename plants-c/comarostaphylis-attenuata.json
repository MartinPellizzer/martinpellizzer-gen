    "intro": "Comarostaphylis attenuata, commonly known as the slender leaf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself to substrates. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Comarostaphylis attenuata is a carnivorous plant, using its specialized bladders to digest trapped prey for additional nutrients."
