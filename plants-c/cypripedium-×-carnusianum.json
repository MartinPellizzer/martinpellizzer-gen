    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 carnusianum, commonly known as the Carnusian lady's tresses, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and dense clusters of pale pink to white flowers that resemble a lace-like pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
