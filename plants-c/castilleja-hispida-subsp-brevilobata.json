    "intro": "Castilleja hispida subsp. brevilobata, commonly known as the short-lipped stork's bill, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients. The plant features showy, red-orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually hairy and opposite, and it often grows in open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more rounded lobes on the calyx compared to other Castilleja species."
