    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 macrocarpa nothovar. bohemica, commonly known as the Bohemian hawthorn, is a hybrid plant that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species. It is characterized by its dense, thorned growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it adaptable to different environments. The plant produces white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that are often used in herbal remedies. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and seasonal color changes. Due to its hybrid nature, it is often cultivated for both its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits in gardens and landscapes."
