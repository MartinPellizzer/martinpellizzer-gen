    "intro": "Combretum lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flame bush, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to red, depending on the species. These flowers are typically followed by small, woody capsules that contain the seeds. Combretum lanceolatum is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native habitat."
