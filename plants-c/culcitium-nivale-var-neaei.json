    "intro": "Culcitium nivale var. neaei, commonly known as the snow cushion, is a rare and alpine plant native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushions of silvery-gray foliage that help it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces small, white flowers in the summer, which are clustered in tight inflorescences. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which reduces water loss and reflects sunlight. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a species of conservation concern."
