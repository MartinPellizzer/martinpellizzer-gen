    "intro": "Chosenia splendida, commonly known as the golden bamboo or golden grass, is a tall, grass-like plant native to Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow leaves that are often bright yellow or golden in color, giving it its striking appearance. The plant grows in moist, tropical environments and is often found near water bodies. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense clumps. Despite its ornamental value, it is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
