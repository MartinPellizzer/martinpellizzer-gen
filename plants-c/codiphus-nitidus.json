    "intro": "Codiphus nitidus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its seeds are enclosed in three-winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. Codiphus nitidus is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in some areas."
