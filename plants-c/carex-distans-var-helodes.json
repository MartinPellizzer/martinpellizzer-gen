    "intro": "Carex distans var. helodes, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
