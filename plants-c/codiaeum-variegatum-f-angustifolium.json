    "intro": "Codiaeum variegatum f. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf croton, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that often display vibrant patterns of red, yellow, and green. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage changes with the seasons, offering seasonal color variations that make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens. Due to its sensitivity to cold temperatures, it is typically grown as a tropical plant in temperate climates."
