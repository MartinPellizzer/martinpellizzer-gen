    "intro": "Conostomium, commonly known as the golden cup, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often yellow or orange flowers that resemble small cups, hence their common name. Conostomium species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. They often have opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produce small, clustered inflorescences. The genus includes several species, such as *Conostomium pulchellum*, which is prized for its ornamental value in gardens."
