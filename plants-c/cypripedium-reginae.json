    "intro": "Cypripedium reginae, commonly known as the Queen of the Mountains, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive pink or white flowers with a prominent, showy lip that resembles a crown, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and wetlands, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem, which blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
