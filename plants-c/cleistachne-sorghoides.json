    "intro": "Cleistachne sorghoides, commonly known as wild sorghum, is a grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often enclosed in leaf sheaths, making them difficult to observe. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Cleistachne sorghoides is notable for its adaptability and resilience to environmental stress."
