    "intro": "Carex teretiuscula subsp. modesta, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ability to thrive in diverse hydrological conditions."
