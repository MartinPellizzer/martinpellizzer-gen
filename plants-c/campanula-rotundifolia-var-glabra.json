It features rounded, broad leaves that are typically smooth to the touch, giving it its varietal name \"glabra.\" The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
