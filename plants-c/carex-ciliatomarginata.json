    "intro": "Carex ciliatomarginata, commonly known as the silky edge sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, particularly along the margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along the edges of ponds. Carex ciliatomarginata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
