    "intro": "Cirrhaea, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and has delicate, branching stems. Its leaves are thin and often lack true roots, relying instead on its specialized bladders for nutrient absorption. Cirrhaea is a carnivorous plant, supplementing its nutrient intake through the digestion of captured prey."
