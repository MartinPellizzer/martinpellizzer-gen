    "intro": "Cypripedium chinense, commonly known as the Chinese lady's slipper, is a perennial orchid native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, large flower per stem. Cypripedium chinense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also studied for its ecological and medicinal potential."
