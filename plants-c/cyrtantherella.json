    "intro": "Cyrtantherella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the orchid family. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers and its unique growth habit, often growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a epiphytic species. Cyrtantherella is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists due to its rarity and ecological significance. Its botanical study provides valuable insights into the adaptation strategies of epiphytic plants in tropical ecosystems."
