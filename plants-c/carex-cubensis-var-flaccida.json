    "intro": "Carex cubensis var. flaccida, commonly known as the Florida sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually green to bluish-green in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. It is often found in swamps and coastal areas, contributing to the ecological stability of these habitats. The species is valued for its ability to thrive in saturated soils and its role in wetland restoration projects."
