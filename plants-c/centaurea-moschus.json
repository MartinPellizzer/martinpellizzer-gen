    "intro": "Centaurea moschus, commonly known as musk thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a distinctive musky scent, which is harvested from its flowers and used in perfumery. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
