    "intro": "Castanea ashei, commonly known as the Florida chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and clustered flowers. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks, similar to other chestnut species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in hardwood forests. Unfortunately, it is now considered extinct in the wild due to historical overharvesting and disease."
