    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. subamara, commonly known as the dwarf coconut palm, is a variant of the coconut tree characterized by its shorter stature and compact growth habit. It produces small, less abundant coconut fruits compared to the standard coconut palm, with a more rounded crown of leaves. The plant is adapted to coastal and tropical environments, thriving in sandy soils and high humidity. Its leaves are broad and feather-like, contributing to its ornamental value in landscaping. This variety is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and as a hardy, low-maintenance plant in tropical gardens."
