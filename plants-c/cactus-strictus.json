    "intro": "Cactus strictus, commonly known as the rigid cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in spines for protection against herbivores and to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to access water from underground sources, enabling survival in harsh desert conditions. Cactus strictus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
