    "intro": "Cyclosorus longissimus, commonly known as the long-stemmed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to freshwater environments in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that can reach several meters in length, making it one of the most striking members of the water fern family. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still water, often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the water surface, anchoring the plant and facilitating the growth of new fronds. Cyclosorus longissimus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
