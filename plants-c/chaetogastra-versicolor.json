It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its strikingly colorful, showy bracts that range from red to orange and yellow. These bracts are not true flowers but serve to attract pollinators. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks."
