    "intro": "Ctenitis jiulungshanensis, commonly known as the Jiulungshan holly fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it benefits from high humidity and dappled sunlight. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ctenitis jiulungshanensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
