    "intro": "Cladocolea glauca, commonly known as blue-green cliffweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along coastal areas. The plant produces small, blue-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Cladocolea glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
