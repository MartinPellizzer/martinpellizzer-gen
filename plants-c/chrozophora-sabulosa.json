    "intro": "Chrozophora sabulosa, commonly known as sand bur, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is an annual herb that typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Its leaves are alternate, hairy, and have a distinctive heart-shaped base. Chrozophora sabulosa is adapted to arid environments and has a short growing season, blooming in the spring and early summer."
