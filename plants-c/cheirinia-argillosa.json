    "intro": "Cheirinia argillosa, commonly known as the clayroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in the spring. It has a fibrous root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Cheirinia argillosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
