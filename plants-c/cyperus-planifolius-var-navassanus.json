    "intro": "Cyperus planifolius var. navassanus, commonly known as the Navassa flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies, and is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels. Due to its aquatic habitat and morphological features, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
