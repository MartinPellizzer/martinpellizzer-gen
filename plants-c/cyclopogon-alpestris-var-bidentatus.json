    "intro": "Cyclopogon alpestris var. bidentatus, commonly known as the alpine cyclopogon, is a rare and specialized plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, commonly referred to as grasses, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered inflorescences that are often overlooked due to its modest appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
