It is a terrestrial bromeliad characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers that are borne on short stalks. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to support microhabitats."
