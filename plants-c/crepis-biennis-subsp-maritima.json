    "intro": "Crepis biennis subsp. maritima, commonly known as the sea hawksbeard, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, linear leaves that are adapted to saline and wind-exposed environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in maritime climates. It produces small, achene fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread along coastal areas. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in harsh, coastal conditions."
