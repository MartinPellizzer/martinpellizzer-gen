It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are deeply divided into small, feather-like segments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, fleshy fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
