    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe jaramilloi, commonly known as the Jaramillo's fern, is a rare and specialized epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with fine, hairy structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees or in rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Crocodeilanthe jaramilloi is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
