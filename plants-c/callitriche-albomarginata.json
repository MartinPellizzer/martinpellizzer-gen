    "intro": "Callitriche albomarginata, commonly known as white-margin water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has small, floating leaves that are usually oval or lance-shaped with a white margin. It produces tiny, green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Callitriche albomarginata is often found in still or slow-moving water, where it can spread through both sexual reproduction and vegetative means."
