The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellow, forming compact clusters. Chusua limprichtii is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological significance in its native ecosystems."
