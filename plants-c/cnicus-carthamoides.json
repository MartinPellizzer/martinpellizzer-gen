    "intro": "Cnicus carthamoides, commonly known as sow thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual or biennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring a hairy stem and alternate, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Sow thistle is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields, and it is sometimes considered a weed. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisine and herbal medicine."
