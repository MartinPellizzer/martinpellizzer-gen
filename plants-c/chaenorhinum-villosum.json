    "intro": "Chaenorhinum villosum, commonly known as the hairy horned poppy, is an annual flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
