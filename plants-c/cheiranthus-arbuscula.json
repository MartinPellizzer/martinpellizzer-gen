    "intro": "Cheiranthus arbuscula, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Cheiranthus arbuscula is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it is adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
