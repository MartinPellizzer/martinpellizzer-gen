    "intro": "Cibotium siempay, commonly known as the Philippine tree fern, is a member of the Dicksoniaceae family and is native to the Philippines. It is a tall, tree-like fern that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, characterized by its large, pinnate fronds. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered with a dense layer of old leaf bases. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous cover. Cibotium siempay is often found in humid, shaded environments such as montane forests."
