    "intro": "Cnicus cavaleriei, commonly known as the Italian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
