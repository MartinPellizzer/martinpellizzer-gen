    "intro": "Cyathea benculensis, commonly known as the Benculen tree fern, is a tropical evergreen plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots. The plant produces large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern around the trunk. Cyathea benculensis is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
