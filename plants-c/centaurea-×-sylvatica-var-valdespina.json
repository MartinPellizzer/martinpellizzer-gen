    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 sylvatica var. valdespina, commonly known as the Valdespina cornflower, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, typically from July to September. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and forms compact, bushy growth, often reaching heights of up to 60 cm. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
