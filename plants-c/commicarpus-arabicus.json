    "intro": "Commicarpus arabicus, commonly known as the Arabian thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Commicarpus arabicus is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to drought conditions."
