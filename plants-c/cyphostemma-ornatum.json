It features slender, woody stems that can reach several meters in length, often trailing or climbing over other vegetation. The leaves are opposite, simple, and elliptical, with a smooth surface and a slightly glossy appearance. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in terminal panicles, producing a subtle fragrance. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments."
