It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Calligonum kurotschkinae is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
