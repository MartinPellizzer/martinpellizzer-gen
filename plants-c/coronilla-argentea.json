    "intro": "Coronilla argentea, commonly known as silver vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. The plant features small, fluffy white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a silvery-blue hue that gives it its common name. Coronilla argentea is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
