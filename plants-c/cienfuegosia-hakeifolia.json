It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and well-drained soils. It is often found in dry, sandy habitats and is considered a rare species due to its limited distribution. The plant's ornamental value has led to some cultivation efforts, although it remains uncommon in horticultural trade."
