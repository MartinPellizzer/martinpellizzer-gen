    "intro": "Chloanthes loxocarpa, commonly known as the white-flowered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, sprawling growth habit. The plant features small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Chloanthes loxocarpa is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats."
