    "intro": "Columnea calcarata, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a distinctive dark tip. The plant typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, thriving in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually opposite and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Columnea calcarata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
