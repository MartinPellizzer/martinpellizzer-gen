    "intro": "Cosmia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate cosmos, is a low-growing annual herb native to South America. It features slender, creeping stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming from summer to fall. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Cosmia prostrata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
