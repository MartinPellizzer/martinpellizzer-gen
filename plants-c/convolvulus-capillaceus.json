It is a herbaceous annual that produces small, delicate blue or purple flowers. The plant has thin, wiry stems and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed."
