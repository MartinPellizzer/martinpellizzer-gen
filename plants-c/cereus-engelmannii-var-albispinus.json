It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to arid environments. This variety is notable for its striking appearance and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
