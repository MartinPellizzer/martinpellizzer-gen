    "intro": "Cytisus villarsii, commonly known as the Corsican broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, leathery pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. Cytisus villarsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its bright floral display."
