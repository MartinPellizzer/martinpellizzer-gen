    "intro": "Chamaegigas, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Africa, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. The plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often found in rocky or mountainous areas. The leaves are usually palmately lobed, and the plants are adapted to thrive in well-drained soils."
