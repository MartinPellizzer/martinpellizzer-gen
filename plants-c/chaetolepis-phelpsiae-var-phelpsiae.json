    "intro": "Chaetolepis phelpsiae var. phelpsiae, commonly known as the Phelps' chaetolepis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive, feathery appearance, while its flowers are small and clustered in umbrella-like arrangements. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
