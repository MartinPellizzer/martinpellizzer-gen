It is characterized by its unique, zigzagging stems that give it its common name. The leaves are typically opposite and elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, often with four petals. Campyloptera species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are often found in moist, shaded environments."
