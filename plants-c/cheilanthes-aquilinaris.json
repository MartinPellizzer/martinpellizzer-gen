    "intro": "Cheilanthes aquilinaris, commonly known as the mountain feather fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky outcrops and slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soil. The plant has slender, wiry fronds with a delicate, feathery appearance, and its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the leaves. It is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh environments. Cheilanthes aquilinaris is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
