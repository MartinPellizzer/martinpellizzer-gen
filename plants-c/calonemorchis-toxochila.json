    "intro": "Calonemorchis toxochila, commonly known as the toxic orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to certain regions of South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring a slender stem and a single, showy flower. The plant produces a yellow-green flower with a unique structure that includes a specialized lip, which is a characteristic feature of many orchids. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in home gardens."
