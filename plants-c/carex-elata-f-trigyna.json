    "intro": "Carex elata f. trigyna, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a sedge species characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, and is native to parts of North America. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly folded, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clustered inflorescences. It is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to waterlogged environments, with rhizomatous growth and specialized leaf anatomy."
