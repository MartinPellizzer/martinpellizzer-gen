    "intro": "Cattleya guttata f. albina, commonly known as the white-flowered cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its striking white petals and vibrant yellow lip. It is a member of the Cattleya genus, native to the tropical regions of South America. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are short-lived but highly fragrant, often appearing in clusters during the warm season. The f. albina form is notable for its lack of the typical red or purple markings found in the species."
