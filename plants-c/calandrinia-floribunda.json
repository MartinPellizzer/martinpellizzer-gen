    "intro": "Calandrinia floribunda, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to violet, often with a contrasting throat. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Calandrinia floribunda is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
