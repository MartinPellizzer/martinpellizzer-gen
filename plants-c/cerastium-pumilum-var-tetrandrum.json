    "intro": "Cerastium pumilum var. tetrandrum, commonly known as the mossy chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
