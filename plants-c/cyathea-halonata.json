    "intro": "Cyathea halonata, commonly known as the Halonata tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a distinctive crown of fronds that can reach several meters in height, giving it a dramatic appearance. Its rhizome is thick and woody, supporting the growth of the fronds above. Cyathea halonata is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and along stream banks."
