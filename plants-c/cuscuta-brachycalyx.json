    "intro": "Cuscuta brachycalyx, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its host to establish a connection. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on grasses, sedges, and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle is short, with rapid growth and reproduction, allowing it to spread quickly in suitable environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
