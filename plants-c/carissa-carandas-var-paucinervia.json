    "intro": "Carissa carandas var. paucinervia, commonly known as the dwarf star apple, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are narrower and fewer-veined compared to the typical variety, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that develop into orange-yellow berries, which are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens and container planting. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
