    "intro": "Cassia andina, commonly known as the Andean senna, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing properties. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. Cassia andina is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
