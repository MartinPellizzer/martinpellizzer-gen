    "intro": "Carex atrata subsp. pullata, commonly known as black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, sword-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest understories. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in suitable habitats. The subspecies pullata is distinguished by its darker foliage and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Carex atrata."
