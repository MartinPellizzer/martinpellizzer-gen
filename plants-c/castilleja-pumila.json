    "intro": "Castilleja pumila, commonly known as the dwarf paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves, which help it conserve water in its arid habitat. It forms symbiotic relationships with certain host plants, drawing nutrients through its haustoria. Castilleja pumila is often found in open, dry areas such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
