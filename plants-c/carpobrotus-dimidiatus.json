It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its roots form a dense mat, helping to prevent soil erosion on coastal and sandy soils. It is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
