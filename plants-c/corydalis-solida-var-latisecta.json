    "intro": "Corydalis solida var. latisecta, commonly known as the broad-leaf Corydalis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white. The leaves are distinctive for their broad, divided lobes, which give the plant its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained, moist soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
