    "intro": "Crepis baetica, commonly known as the Iberian mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as scrublands and grasslands. It is an annual or biennial herb that produces numerous small achenes, which are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
