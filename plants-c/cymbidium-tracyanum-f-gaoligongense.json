    "intro": "Cymbidium tracyanum f. gaoligongense, commonly known as the Gaoligong Mountain cymbidium, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically display a combination of yellow and red hues. The plant prefers cool, humid environments and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
