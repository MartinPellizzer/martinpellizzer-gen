    "intro": "Caladenia perangusta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed spider orchid, is an orchid species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flower spike that bears a single, delicate orchid flower. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats. It blooms during the cooler months, usually from July to September. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
