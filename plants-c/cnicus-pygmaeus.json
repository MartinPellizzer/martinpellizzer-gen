    "intro": "Cnicus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf sow-thistle, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its compact size and rapid growth, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
