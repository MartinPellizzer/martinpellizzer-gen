    "intro": "Calamagrostis lapponica var. nearctica, commonly known as the Arctic grass or northern reed, is a cold-hardy perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia. It typically grows in open, rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, exhibiting a clumping growth habit. The plant produces slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its flowering spikes are usually small and inconspicuous, appearing in late summer to early autumn. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
