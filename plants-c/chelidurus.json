    "intro": "Chelidurus, commonly known as the sea urchin, is a marine echinoderm characterized by its spiny, spherical body. It belongs to the class Echinoidea and is found in various marine environments worldwide. The plant-like appearance of its body is due to its calcareous exoskeleton, which provides structural support. Chelidurus lacks true leaves or roots, instead relying on its spines for protection and mobility. Its reproductive structures are internal, with females laying eggs that develop externally in the water."
