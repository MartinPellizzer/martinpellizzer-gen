    "intro": "Carex rigida f. androgyna, commonly known as the rigid sedge, is a variant of the rigid sedge species native to North America. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. The inflorescence consists of male and female flowers, with the female flowers often found at the base, a feature that distinguishes this form from the typical species."
