    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis var. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping water crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist meadows and stream banks. It features a rosette of basal leaves with a distinctive basal lobed shape and a hairy texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a single umbel, typically blooming in early spring. Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its aesthetic appeal in wetland habitats."
