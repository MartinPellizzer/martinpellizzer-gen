    "intro": "Carduus platypus, commonly known as the broadleaf thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, bluish-green, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its latex-rich sap can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care. The broadleaf thistle is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and fields."
