    "intro": "Calceolaria cumbemayensis, commonly known as the Andean hooded orchid, is a member of the Calceolaria genus, which is native to South America. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like flowers that resemble small cups or bells, a feature that gives the genus its name. This plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, delicate flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Calceolaria cumbemayensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
