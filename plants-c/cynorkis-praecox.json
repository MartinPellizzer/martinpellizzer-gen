    "intro": "Cynorkis praecox, commonly known as the early cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of pinnate, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It is native to parts of Africa and is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
