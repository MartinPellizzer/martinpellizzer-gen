    "intro": "Calanthe pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered calanthe, is a species of orchid native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizomatous growth habit and its elegant, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically arranged in a loose spike. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
