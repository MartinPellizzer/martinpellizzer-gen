It is a trailing or climbing annual herb with opposite, heart-shaped leaves and tendrils that help it climb. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically blue, purple, or white, blooming in the morning. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Convolvulus curtana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
