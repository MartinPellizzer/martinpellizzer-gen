    "intro": "Comarella sabulosa, commonly known as the sand dune aster, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments where it plays a role in stabilizing sand through its extensive root system. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind, making it a hardy species in harsh coastal conditions. Comarella sabulosa is also valued for its ecological importance in maintaining biodiversity in dune ecosystems."
