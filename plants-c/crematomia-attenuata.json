    "intro": "Crematomia attenuata, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including livestock. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Crematomia attenuata plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not as widely cultivated as other milkweed species."
