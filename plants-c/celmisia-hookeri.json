    "intro": "Celmisia hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's celmisia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are often silver- or gray-haired, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Celmisia hookeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
