    "intro": "Cicer punctatum, commonly known as the spotted vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with distinctive black spots and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Cicer punctatum is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
