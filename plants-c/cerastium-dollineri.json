    "intro": "Cerastium dollineri, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh alpine environment. Cerastium dollineri is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
