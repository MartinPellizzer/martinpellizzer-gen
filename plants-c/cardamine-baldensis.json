    "intro": "Cardamine baldensis, commonly known as the bald mountain watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along streams and in rocky woods. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a single umbel, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Cardamine baldensis is a rare and endangered species, with limited populations due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
