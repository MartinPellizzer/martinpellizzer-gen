It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. Cyperus platystylis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
