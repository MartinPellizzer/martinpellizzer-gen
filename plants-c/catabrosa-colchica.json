    "intro": "Catabrosa colchica, commonly known as the Colchic Mountain Bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Turkey. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers in late summer. The plant is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance. However, it is important to note that it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
