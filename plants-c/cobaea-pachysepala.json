    "intro": "Cobaea pachysepala, commonly known as the giant bellflower, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, bell-shaped flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in length. The plant features thick, fleshy sepals that give it its scientific name, \"pachysepala,\" meaning thick sepals. It thrives in cool, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Cobaea pachysepala is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections."
