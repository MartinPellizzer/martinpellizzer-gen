It features dense, compact growth with small, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tint. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container gardening."
