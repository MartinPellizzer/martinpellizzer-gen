    "intro": "Capanea hansteinii var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate capanea, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered umbels of white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species with potential ecological significance in its native ecosystems."
