    "intro": "Campanula macrorhiza var. jurjurensis, commonly known as the giant bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Western Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a robust root system and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and it can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. This variant is notable for its larger flowers compared to the typical form of Campanula macrorhiza."
