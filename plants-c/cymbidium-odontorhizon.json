It features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in various environmental conditions. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing numerous lanceolate, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow. Its leaves are linear, grass-like, and arranged in two rows around the pseudobulbs. Cymbidium odontorhizon is valued for its ornamental beauty and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
