    "intro": "Chloothamnus obtusus, commonly known as the bluntleaf goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a low, sprawling growth habit. It produces small, seed-like fruits called cypselae, which are dispersed by the wind. Chloothamnus obtusus is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native range."
