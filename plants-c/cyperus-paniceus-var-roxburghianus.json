    "intro": "Cyperus paniceus var. roxburghianus, commonly known as the Roxburgh flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. This variety is native to tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Asia and Africa, and thrives in wet or moist environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, often forming dense stands in wetlands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, contributing to its reproductive success in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
