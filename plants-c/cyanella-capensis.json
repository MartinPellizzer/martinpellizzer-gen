It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring. It is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Cyanella capensis thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and Mediterranean climates."
