    "intro": "Cabralea corcovadensis, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It features a dense, rounded canopy with small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries. It is adapted to grow in moist, tropical climates and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a problematic species in certain regions."
