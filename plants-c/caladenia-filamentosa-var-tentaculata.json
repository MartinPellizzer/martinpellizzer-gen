    "intro": "Caladenia filamentosa var. tentaculata, commonly known as the tentacle spider-orchid, is a striking orchid species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like sepals and petals that give it a spider-like appearance. The plant produces a single, erect stem bearing a single spike of flowers, typically in shades of pink and white. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
