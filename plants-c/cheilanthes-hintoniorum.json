    "intro": "Cheilanthes hintoniorum, commonly known as the Hinton's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and is typically found growing on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The fronds are usually leathery and have a dark green color, with a distinctive shape that helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. This plant is native to regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It plays a minor but ecologically significant role in stabilizing rocky soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
