    "intro": "Carex flavofulva, commonly known as the yellowish sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. Carex flavofulva thrives in full to partial sun and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its ability to tolerate wet conditions makes it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
