    "intro": "Crataegus poiretiana, commonly known as the Poiret hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Crataegus poiretiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
