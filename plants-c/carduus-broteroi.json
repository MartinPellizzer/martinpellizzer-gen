    "intro": "Carduus broteroi, commonly known as the Broter's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, showy purple composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces achenes that are dispersed by wind. Carduus broteroi is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
