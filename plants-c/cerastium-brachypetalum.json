    "intro": "Cerastium brachypetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, white flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowering period typically occurs in early spring, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
