It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, fleshy, orange-red berries. Its stems are woody and often have a climbing habit, making it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover.
