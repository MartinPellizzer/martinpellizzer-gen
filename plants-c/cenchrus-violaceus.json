    "intro": "Cenchrus violaceus, commonly known as purple beardgrass, is a flowering plant native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like clusters of purple or pink flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Cenchrus violaceus is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
