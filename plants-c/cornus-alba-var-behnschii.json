    "intro": "Cornus alba var. behnschii, commonly known as the Behnschii dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking red stems that become more vivid as the weather turns colder in autumn. The plant produces small white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. This ornamental plant is valued for its seasonal color changes and is often used in garden landscapes for its visual appeal."
