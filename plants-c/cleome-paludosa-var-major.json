    "intro": "Cleome paludosa var. major, commonly known as swamp cleome, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features upright, branching stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces showy, yellow-centered flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, sandy or loamy soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in wet garden settings."
