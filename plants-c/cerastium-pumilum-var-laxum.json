    "intro": "Cerastium pumilum var. laxum, commonly known as the small mouse-ear or woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover."
