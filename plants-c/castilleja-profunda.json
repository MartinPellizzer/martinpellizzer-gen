    "intro": "Castilleja profunda, commonly known as the deepleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on host plants for water and nutrients, often growing on grasses or shrubs. Its root system forms a symbiotic relationship with fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Castilleja profunda is an important plant in native ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and serving as a food source for pollinators."
