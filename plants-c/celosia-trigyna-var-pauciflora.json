    "intro": "Celosia trigyna var. pauciflora, commonly known as the flame flower or red dwarf celosia, is a compact, ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features upright, branching stems covered in dense, bright red bracts that resemble flames, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers at the base of the bracts, which are often overshadowed by the vibrant foliage. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for gardens and containers. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
