    "intro": "Cotoneaster rhytidophyllus, commonly known as the rough-leaved cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage and seasonal interest. Cotoneaster rhytidophyllus is relatively low maintenance and resistant to most pests and diseases."
