    "intro": "Centaurea vermiculigera, commonly known as the mouse-eared chickweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution across temperate regions."
