    "intro": "Carex pseudoarenicola, commonly known as the sand sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its reproductive structures consist of small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-nerved, spike-like fruits. Carex pseudoarenicola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
