It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking, hooded flowers that resemble small lanterns. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as Andean grasslands, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Calceolaria thyrsiflora is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
