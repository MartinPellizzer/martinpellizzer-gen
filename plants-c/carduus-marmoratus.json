    "intro": "Carduus marmoratus, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disc florets. The plant features a tall, hairy stem with basal leaves that are lobed and covered in fine hairs. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in summer, and it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated but can become invasive in certain regions."
