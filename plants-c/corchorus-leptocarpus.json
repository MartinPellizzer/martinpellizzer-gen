    "intro": "Corchorus leptocarpus, commonly known as slender-seeded knotweed, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its upright stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and typically have five pale yellow petals. The seeds are encased in a fibrous, spiny capsule, which aids in their dispersal by wind and animals."
