    "intro": "Cousinia farsistanica, commonly known as the Persian cudweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of Iran and Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in dry, harsh environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cousinia farsistanica produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid landscapes."
