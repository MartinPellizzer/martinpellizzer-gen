    "intro": "Crinum asiaticum subvar. brevifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved crinum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves and large, showy flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and swampy areas. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a strong, fragrant scent. The rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
