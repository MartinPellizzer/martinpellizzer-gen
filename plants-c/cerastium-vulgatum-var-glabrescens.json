    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabrescens is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in temperate regions and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
