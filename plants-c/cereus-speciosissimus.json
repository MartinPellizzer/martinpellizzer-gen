    "intro": "Cereus speciosissimus, commonly known as the \"Fairy Candelabra,\" is a striking cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that branch into clusters of long, thin, ribbed segments. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habits make it a popular choice for desert gardens and indoor cultivation."
