    "intro": "Cyclea fansipanensis, commonly known as the Fansipan cycad, is a unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of Vietnam. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is adapted to rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
