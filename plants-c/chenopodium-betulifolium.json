It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 1 meter tall, with alternate, broadly ovate to triangular leaves that are often covered in fine silver hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are encased in a hard, triangular capsule. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. The species is known for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
