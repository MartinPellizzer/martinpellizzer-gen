    "intro": "Causonis maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Causonis maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
