    "intro": "Croton aceroides, commonly known as the velvetleaf croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
