    "intro": "Cyrtochilum geniculatum, commonly known as the curling orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, often twisted growth habit and its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it requires high light intensity to produce its showy blooms. Cyrtochilum geniculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
