    "intro": "Calopogon pulchellus var. simpsonii, commonly known as the Simpson's grass pink, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic wetlands and requires a specific combination of soil and moisture conditions to thrive. Its leaves are grass-like and narrow, and it produces small, tuberous roots that help it survive in its wetland habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
