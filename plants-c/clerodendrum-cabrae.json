It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
