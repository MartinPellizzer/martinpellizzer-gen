    "intro": "Carpinus glandulosopunctata, commonly known as the punctate hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a glandular-punctate surface. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive form."
