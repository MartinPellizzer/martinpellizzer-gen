It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its unique morphological features. The plant typically exhibits a slender trunk with a single crown of leaves, and its foliage is often dense and leathery. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
