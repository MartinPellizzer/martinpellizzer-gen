    "intro": "Clidemia acostae, commonly known as the Acosta's mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in parts of Cuba and the Isle of Pines. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and often exhibits a trailing growth habit. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests and along stream banks. Clidemia acostae plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small invertebrates."
