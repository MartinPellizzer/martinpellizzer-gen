    "intro": "Cousinia eriocephala, commonly known as the woolly cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Cousinia eriocephala is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is an important component of its native ecosystems."
