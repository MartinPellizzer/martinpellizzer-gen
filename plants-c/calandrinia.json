    "intro": "Calandrinia, commonly known as the \"pink morning glory,\" is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves and stems, which help it conserve water in arid environments. Calandrinia species are often grown as ornamental plants due to their vibrant blooms and drought tolerance. They typically bloom in the morning and close their flowers by midday, a trait that gives them their common name."
