    "intro": "Cynara scolymus f. minor, commonly known as the small globe artichoke, is a cultivated variant of the artichoke plant. It is characterized by its compact, smaller size compared to the standard artichoke, with tightly packed, tender leaves that form a dense, rounded head. The plant is a perennial in mild climates but is typically grown as an annual in colder regions. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental and culinary use."
