    "intro": "Clematis dioscoreifolia var. robusta, commonly known as the robust clematis, is a vigorous climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, often with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Due to its rapid growth, it is often used in ornamental gardening to cover trellises or walls."
