    "intro": "Carex mollicula f. lutescens, commonly known as the golden sedges, is a striking variant of the common sedge. It is characterized by its bright yellow foliage, which contrasts sharply with its typical green form. This plant is a perennial herbaceous species that thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wetlands. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a soft texture that distinguishes it from other sedges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in late spring to early summer, contributing to its ornamental value in wetland gardens."
