    "intro": "Carex venosivaginata, commonly known as the veined bulbous sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, cylindrical leaves and spikelets that bear small, three-lobed flowers. Native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas. Its unique venation pattern on the leaves is a distinguishing feature that aids in its identification."
