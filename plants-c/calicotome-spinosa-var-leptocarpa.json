It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads, which are followed by woody, spiny fruits. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor, sandy soils. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
