    "intro": "Convolvulus terrestris, commonly known as the common morning glory, is a herbaceous annual plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features prostrate or trailing stems that can grow up to 1 meter in length, adorned with heart-shaped, pale green leaves. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, opening in the morning and closing in the afternoon. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
