    "intro": "Conyza ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as Ruwenzori fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its small, daisy-like flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces fine, hairy seeds that are easily carried by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
