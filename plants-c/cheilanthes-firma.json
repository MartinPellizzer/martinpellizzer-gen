    "intro": "Cheilanthes firma, commonly known as the rigid lady fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its upright, stiff fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and can often be found growing on rock faces or in dry, shaded areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Cheilanthes firma is a hardy, low-maintenance plant often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to survive in harsh environments."
