It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by kidney-shaped, edible seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and poor nutrient conditions. This species is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dry fields."
