    "intro": "Codonopsis bhutanica, commonly known as the Bhutanese ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayan regions of Bhutan and neighboring areas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its erect stem and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, preferring cool and moist environments. Its tuberous roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
