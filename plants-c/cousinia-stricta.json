    "intro": "Cousinia stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the western United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of yellow flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically narrow and linear, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Cousinia stricta is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
