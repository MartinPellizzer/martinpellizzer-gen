    "intro": "Cliffortia conoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandthrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and clusters of pale yellow to cream-colored flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments. It is adapted to withstand harsh conditions, including drought and strong coastal winds. Cliffortia conoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
