    "intro": "Cyclosorus muricatus, commonly known as the rough liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a rough, segmented thallus and small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its thallus for absorption and photosynthesis. Cyclosorus muricatus is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
