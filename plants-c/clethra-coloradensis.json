    "intro": "Clethra coloradensis, commonly known as the Colorado sweet pepper bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds. Clethra coloradensis is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
