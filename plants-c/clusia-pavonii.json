    "intro": "Clusia pavonii, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, orange-red fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, yellow pulp. Clusia pavonii is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
