    "intro": "Coryphantha grahamii, commonly known as Graham's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a globular shape and typically produces yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems. It is often found in rocky soils and is an important part of the desert ecosystem."
