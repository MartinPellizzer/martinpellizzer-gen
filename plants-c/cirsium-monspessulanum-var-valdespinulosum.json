    "intro": "Cirsium monspessulanum var. valdespinulosum, commonly known as the Valdespinulosum thistle, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many flowering plants with composite flower heads."
