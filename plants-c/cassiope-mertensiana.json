    "intro": "Cassiope mertensiana, commonly known as the mountain snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the alpine regions of North America. It features dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has leathery, dark green leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or gray pubescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in subalpine and alpine habitats. Cassiope mertensiana is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
