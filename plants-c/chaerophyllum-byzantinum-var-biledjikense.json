    "intro": "Chaerophyllum byzantinum var. biledjikense, commonly known as the Bilecik chervil, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Turkey. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky and calcareous soils, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a distinctive, herbaceous scent, while its flowers are small and white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
