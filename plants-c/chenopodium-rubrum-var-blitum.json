It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, broadly ovate leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically flowering and seeding in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
