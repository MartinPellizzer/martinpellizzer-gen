    "intro": "Coryanthes mastersiana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, ghost-like appearance with long, slender petals and a distinctive, elongated spur. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to grow on tree trunks or branches. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insects. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species."
