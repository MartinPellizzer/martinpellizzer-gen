    "intro": "Cephaelis peduncularis var. hypsophila, commonly known as the Himalayan blue poppy, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking cobalt-blue petals and is often found growing in alpine meadows at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 5,000 meters. The plant has a short, upright stem with simple, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its flowers are typically solitary and bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its beauty and resilience in cooler climates."
