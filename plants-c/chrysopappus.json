    "intro": "Chrysopappus, commonly known as the golden coneflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to North America and are characterized by their showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are often hairy and branched. Chrysopappus species are often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
