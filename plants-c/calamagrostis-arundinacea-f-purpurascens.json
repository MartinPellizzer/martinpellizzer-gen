    "intro": "Calamagrostis arundinacea f. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking purple to pink hues in its foliage, which intensify in the autumn. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as meadows and along riverbanks. Its slender, arching stems produce fluffy seed heads that add ornamental value to gardens. It is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
