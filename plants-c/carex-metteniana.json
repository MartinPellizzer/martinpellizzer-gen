    "intro": "Carex metteniana, commonly known as the Metteniana sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, sword-shaped leaves and dense clusters of spikelets. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
