    "intro": "Cyclosorus cangnanensis, commonly known as the Nanjing cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as streams and marshes, where it attaches to submerged or partially submerged surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive circular pattern on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
