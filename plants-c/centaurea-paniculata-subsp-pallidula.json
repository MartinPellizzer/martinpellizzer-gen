    "intro": "Centaurea paniculata subsp. pallidula, commonly known as the pale centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. The subspecies pallidula is distinguished by its paler flower color and shorter, more compact growth form compared to other centaury species."
