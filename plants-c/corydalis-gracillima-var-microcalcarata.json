    "intro": "Corydalis gracillima var. microcalcarata, commonly known as the slender corydalis, is a delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically pale pink to white, with two prominent upper petals and two smaller lower petals, forming a distinctive spurred shape. It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical collections."
