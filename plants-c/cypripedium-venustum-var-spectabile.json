    "intro": "Cypripedium venustum var. spectabile, commonly known as the showy lady's tresses, is a rare and striking orchid native to the temperate regions of North America. It features a tall, slender stem with numerous small, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a dense, spiral-like cluster. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Its unique floral structure and delicate appearance make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in many regions and is often protected by conservation efforts."
