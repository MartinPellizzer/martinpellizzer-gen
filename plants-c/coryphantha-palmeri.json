    "intro": "Coryphantha palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's coryphantha, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of spines and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are ribbed and can store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Coryphantha palmeri is often found in rocky soils and is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
