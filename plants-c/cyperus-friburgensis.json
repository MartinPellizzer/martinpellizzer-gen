    "intro": "Cyperus friburgensis, commonly known as the Friburg sedge, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to submerged soil conditions. Its slender, triangular stems are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Cyperus friburgensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
