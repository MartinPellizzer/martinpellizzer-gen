    "intro": "Cynorkis unguiculata, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically produces small, tubular flowers in shades of violet, pink, and white, often with a contrasting throat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cynorkis unguiculata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
