    "intro": "Cyperus galegensis, commonly known as the Cape rush, is a species of sedge native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable environments. Cyperus galegensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
