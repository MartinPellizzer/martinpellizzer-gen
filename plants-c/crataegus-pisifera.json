    "intro": "Crataegus pisifera, commonly known as the pear-leaved hawthorn, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the eastern United States, where it typically grows in moist, woodlands and along stream banks. The plant is characterized by its smooth, often thornless stems and its clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that appear in spring. Its fruit is a small, yellowish pome that ripens in the fall, and it is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and floral display. The plant also has historical uses in traditional medicine, though its botanical properties are still being studied."
