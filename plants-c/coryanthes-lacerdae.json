    "intro": "Coryanthes lacerdae, commonly known as the blood orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its large, pendulous flowers that are often red or orange in color, resembling blood droplets, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is known for its unique and dramatic floral structure. Its flowers are pollinated by flies, which are attracted by the strong, unpleasant odor that mimics decaying flesh. Coryanthes lacerdae thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a well-draining soil mix to prevent root rot."
