It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with striking yellow or white variegation. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by black, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and is often used as a decorative climbing plant in indoor settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage and ability to climb trellises or walls."
