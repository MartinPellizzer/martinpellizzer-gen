    "intro": "Cullen corylifolium, commonly known as the Chinese holly or Chinese hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties. The plant has a long history of use in both horticulture and herbal remedies."
