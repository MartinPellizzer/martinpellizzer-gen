    "intro": "Cotula elongata, commonly known as the slender daisy, is a low-growing annual plant native to southern Africa. It features small, daisy-like yellow flowers with white ray florets, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has wiry, branching stems covered in fine hairs and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Cotula elongata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in dried flower arrangements."
