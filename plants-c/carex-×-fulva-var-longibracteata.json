    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 fulva var. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and clustered, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowers are usually small and greenish, with male and female flowers often occurring on separate spikes. This variety is notable for its elongated bracts that give it its common name and contribute to its ornamental value in wetland gardens."
