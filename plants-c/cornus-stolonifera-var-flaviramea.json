It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense thickets. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red or orange berries in the fall. Its foliage turns a striking yellow in the autumn, adding ornamental value to gardens. It is often used in landscaping for its attractive form and seasonal color changes."
