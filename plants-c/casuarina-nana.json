    "intro": "Casuarina nana, commonly known as the dwarf she-oak, is a small, evergreen shrub or tree native to coastal areas of Australia. It has distinctive needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems, giving it a unique, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands. Casuarina nana is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils against erosion."
