    "intro": "Calanthe pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf calanthe, is a small, herbaceous orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Calanthe pusilla is noted for its intricate, spurred petals and its ability to bloom multiple times during the growing season. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
