    "intro": "Carum schizopetalum, commonly known as the narrowleaf caraway, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs such as parsley and dill. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. Its leaves are narrow and aromatic, often used in traditional medicine for their digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. The fruit, a small, dry schizocarp, contains two mericarps and is a key feature in its classification."
