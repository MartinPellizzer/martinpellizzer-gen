    "intro": "Carex salina var. hyperborea, commonly known as the Arctic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in wet, saline environments such as coastal tundra and salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and has a robust root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its ability to tolerate extreme conditions makes it an important component of Arctic ecosystems."
