It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming dense clumps. Cyrtochilum ionopterum prefers shady, moist environments and is often found growing in the understory of tropical rainforests."
