    "intro": "Cranfillia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf cranfillia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and swampy areas. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in early spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
