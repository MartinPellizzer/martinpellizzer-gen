    "intro": "Coupoui, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant has specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from the air in waterlogged soils. It plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting marine ecosystems. The small, pinkish flowers of the coupoui attract various pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance."
