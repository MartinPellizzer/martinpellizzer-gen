    "intro": "Cyathea calamitatis, commonly known as the calamity tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its fronds are typically a deep green, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.
