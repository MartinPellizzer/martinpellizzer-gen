    "intro": "Cypripedium vittatum, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy pink or white flowers with a large, slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination trap. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a long, rhizomatous root system. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in many states."
