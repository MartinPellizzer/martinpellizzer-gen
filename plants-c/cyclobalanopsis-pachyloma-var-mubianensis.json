    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis pachyloma var. mubianensis, commonly known as the Mubian ironwood, is a rare and hardy evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its dense, durable wood. The tree has a broad, spreading canopy and produces small, chestnut-like fruits that are dispersed by animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in humid, subtropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
