    "intro": "Cereus longiflorus, commonly known as the long-flowered cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of white, night-blooming flowers. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The cactus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
