    "intro": "Cardamine papillata, commonly known as the papillate watercress, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its small white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in racemose inflorescences. Cardamine papillata is characterized by its unique papillate (bump-like) structures on the underside of its leaves, which give it its common name. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
