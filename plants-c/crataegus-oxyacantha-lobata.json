It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves, and showy clusters of white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for hedging and ornamental gardening."
