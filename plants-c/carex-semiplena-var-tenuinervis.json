    "intro": "Carex semiplena var. tenuinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined semiplena sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, cylindrical leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands, and is native to parts of North America. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. The species is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
