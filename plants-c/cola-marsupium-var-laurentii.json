    "intro": "Cola marsupium var. laurentii, commonly known as the Laurentii's cola, is a species native to western Africa. It belongs to the Sterculiaceae family and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. The seeds are enclosed within a fleshy, red aril, which is a feature common in many cola species. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
