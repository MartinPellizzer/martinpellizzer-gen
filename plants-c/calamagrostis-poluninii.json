    "intro": "Calamagrostis poluninii, commonly known as the Siberian reed, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This plant thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, producing small, spike-like flowers. Calamagrostis poluninii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
