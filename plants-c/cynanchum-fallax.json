    "intro": "Cynanchum fallax, commonly known as the false milkweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its milky sap, like that of other milkweeds, contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores. Cynanchum fallax is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges."
