    "intro": "Cystidianthus laurifolius, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a reddish or bronze underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by ornamental, red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its striking foliage and showy blooms. Cystidianthus laurifolius is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
