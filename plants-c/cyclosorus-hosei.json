    "intro": "Cyclosorus hosei, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, often forming a lush green layer. Cyclosorus hosei is valued in aquatic gardens for its ornamental appearance and ability to provide habitat for small aquatic organisms."
