It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, which opens only at night, a trait known as nyctinasty. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, loose soil for optimal growth. Cleisostoma tixieri is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique blooming behavior and delicate appearance."
