    "intro": "Coffea bridsoniae, commonly known as the Bridson's coffee, is a rare and unique species native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows at elevations above 2,000 meters. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds used for coffee production. It is notable for its ornamental value and has been the subject of botanical interest due to its limited distribution. However, it is not widely cultivated for commercial coffee due to its low yield and specific growing requirements."
