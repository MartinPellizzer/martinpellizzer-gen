    "intro": "Carex sylvatica var. tommasinii, commonly known as the Tommasinii sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the sedge family. Its leaves are usually dark green and slightly folded, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, making it a common sight in wetland habitats."
