    "intro": "Cirsium lucens var. opacum, commonly known as the opacous thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny leaves. The plant typically grows in grasslands, rocky soils, and open woodlands, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with a rough, woolly texture and are covered in stiff, white to grayish hairs. The flowers are usually pale purple to white, forming a showy cluster at the top of the plant, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
