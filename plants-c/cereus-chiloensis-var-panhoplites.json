    "intro": "Cereus chiloensis var. panhoplites, commonly known as the Chilean night-blooming cereus, is a species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a cactus characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is adapted to arid environments with minimal water. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. The varietal name 'panhoplites' refers to its distinctive, broad spines that are more pronounced than in other varieties of Cereus chiloensis."
