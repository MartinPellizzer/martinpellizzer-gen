    "intro": "Cyathea uleana var. uleana, commonly known as the Ulean tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer of dead leaves. The plant produces large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, contributing to its dramatic appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The fronds are used in traditional medicine and as a source of fibers for basket weaving in some cultures."
