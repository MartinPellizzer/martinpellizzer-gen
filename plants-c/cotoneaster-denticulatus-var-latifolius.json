It features simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm in length, with serrated margins. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This variety is often used in landscaping for its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
