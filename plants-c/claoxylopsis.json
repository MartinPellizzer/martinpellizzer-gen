    "intro": "Claoxylopsis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, often with five petals and stamens. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
