    "intro": "Coronilla minima subsp. minor, commonly known as the dwarf crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of violet or blue. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in erosion control due to its extensive root system. This subspecies is closely related to other Coronilla species and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
