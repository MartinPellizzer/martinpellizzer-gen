    "intro": "Crataegus maloides, commonly known as the Maloides hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Crataegus maloides is often found in woodland edges, open woods, and disturbed sites across the eastern United States."
