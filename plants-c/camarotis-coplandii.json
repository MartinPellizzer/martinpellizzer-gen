    "intro": "Camarotis coplandii, commonly known as the Copland's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant blooms that typically feature a mix of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Camarotis coplandii is considered a species of conservation concern."
