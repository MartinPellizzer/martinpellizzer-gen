    "intro": "Chitonanthera calceiformis, commonly known as the sandhill lily, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in open, sandy habitats such as prairies and forest edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Chitonanthera calceiformis is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native range."
