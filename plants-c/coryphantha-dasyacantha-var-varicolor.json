    "intro": "Coryphantha dasyacantha var. varicolor, commonly known as the varicolored hedgehog cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often borne in clusters near the base of the stems. Its succulent leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems to survive in arid environments. This variety is noted for its striking color variations and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
