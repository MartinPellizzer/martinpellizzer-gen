    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 bergamia subsp. mellarosa, commonly known as the Calabrian bergamot, is a citrus hybrid native to southern Italy. It is characterized by its elliptical, thick-skinned fruits that are typically harvested when fully mature. The plant produces a fragrant essential oil from its peel, which is widely used in perfumery and aromatherapy. It thrives in warm, temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires regular pruning for optimal fruit production. This subspecies is valued for both its aromatic properties and its role in traditional Mediterranean agriculture."
