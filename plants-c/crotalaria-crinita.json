    "intro": "Crotalaria crinita, commonly known as the curly-top crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, curling leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, and it has a short, branching stem covered in fine hairs. Crotalaria crinita is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
