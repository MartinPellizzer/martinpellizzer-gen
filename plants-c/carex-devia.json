    "intro": "Carex devia, commonly known as the bent-spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in wet or moist habitats such as marshes and stream sides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green, with a dense cluster of spike-like inflorescences at the top. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in a single, elongated spike that curves downward. Carex devia is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
