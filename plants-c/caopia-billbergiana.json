It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Caopia billbergiana is often found in disturbed areas and can become invasive in certain regions."
