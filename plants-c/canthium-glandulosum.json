    "intro": "Canthium glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky canthium, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, often with yellow or greenish petals. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
