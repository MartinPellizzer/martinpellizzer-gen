    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 berenice, commonly known as the Berenice lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its leaves are broad and ovate, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
