    "intro": "Carya pecan, commonly known as the pecan tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southern United States. It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, edible nuts. The pecan nut develops within a hard, spiny shell that encases a single seed. The tree produces both male and female flowers, with the female flowers being pollinated by wind. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
