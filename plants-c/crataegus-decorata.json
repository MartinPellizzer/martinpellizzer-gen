    "intro": "Crataegus decorata, commonly known as the showy hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its ornate, thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with serrated edges, and turn vibrant shades of red or orange in the autumn."
