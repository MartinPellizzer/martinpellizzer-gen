    "intro": "Cylindropuntia \u00d7 vivipara, commonly known as the jumping cholla, is a hybrid cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems that are covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It is a dioecious species, meaning individual plants are either male or female. The plant's unique ability to produce live offspring through vivipary, where seeds germinate on the mother plant before falling to the ground, is a notable botanical feature."
