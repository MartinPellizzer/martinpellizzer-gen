    "intro": "Cremanthodium pseudo-oblongatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cremanthodium, is a flowering plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of multiple florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in compact clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal in specialized gardens."
