    "intro": "Catabrosa aquatica var. minor, commonly known as the lesser water cress, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually submerged or floating, and it produces tiny white flowers that bloom in the summer. It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through both vegetative propagation and seed dispersal. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
