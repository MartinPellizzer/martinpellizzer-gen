    "intro": "Cephalocereus gaumeri, commonly known as the Mexican night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the states of Coahuila and Nuevo Le\u00f3n in northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a solitary stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Cephalocereus gaumeri is well-suited for cultivation in dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping."
