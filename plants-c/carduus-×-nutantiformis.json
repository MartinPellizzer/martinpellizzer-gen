It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, lobed leaves that often have a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces showy purple to pink flower heads, which are composed of many tiny florets arranged in a composite structure. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
