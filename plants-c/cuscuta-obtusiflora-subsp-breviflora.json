    "intro": "Cuscuta obtusiflora subsp. breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant is native to regions of North America and is often found growing on a variety of host plants, including grasses and forbs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth and health of its host plants."
