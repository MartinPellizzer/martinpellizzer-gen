It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, pinnately compound leaves. The plant has a robust, unbranched trunk with a smooth, dark green bark. Its cones are typically dioecious, with separate male and female plants. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN."
