It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant contains toxic compounds, primarily cicutoxin, which can cause severe poisoning in humans and animals. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and wetlands. Due to its high toxicity, it is considered a noxious weed and requires caution during identification and handling."
