    "intro": "Cryosophila albida, commonly known as the white snowflower, is a rare alpine plant adapted to extreme cold environments. It possesses thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in freezing conditions. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. It is typically found in high-altitude regions with minimal soil and low temperatures. Due to its specialized habitat, Cryosophila albida is considered a sensitive indicator of climate change."
