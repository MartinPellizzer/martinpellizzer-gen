    "intro": "Cyclosorus papyraceus, commonly known as the paper moss, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive leaf structure with a broad, undulating margin and a central midrib. It is often found in forest floors, rock crevices, and along stream banks, where it contributes to soil stabilization. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is a valuable indicator species for assessing habitat quality."
