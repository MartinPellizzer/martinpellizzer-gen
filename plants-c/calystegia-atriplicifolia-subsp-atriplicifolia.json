    "intro": "Calystegia atriplicifolia subsp. atriplicifolia, commonly known as the common morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive wavy margin and produces trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale purple to white. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and climbing habit, often found along roadsides and in disturbed soils. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence the common name. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with a tuft of silky hairs."
