    "intro": "Crotalaria foliosa var. martiana, commonly known as the purple crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive purple or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a striking contrast against its green foliage. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it may be considered invasive in certain areas."
