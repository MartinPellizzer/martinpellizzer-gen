    "intro": "Colona, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface and its striking, showy flowers that bloom in a variety of colors. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps anchor it in muddy substrates. Colona is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its symbolic significance in various cultures adds to its botanical and cultural importance."
