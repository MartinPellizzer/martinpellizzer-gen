It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikes of small, greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. This subspecies is native to certain regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant has fibrous roots and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
