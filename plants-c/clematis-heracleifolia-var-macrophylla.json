    "intro": "Clematis heracleifolia var. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant leaf clematis, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic species in certain regions."
