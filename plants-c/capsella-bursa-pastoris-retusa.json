    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris retusa, commonly known as the common mouse-ear or velvetleaf, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive heart-shaped, inflated pods that resemble a pouch, giving it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The species is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
