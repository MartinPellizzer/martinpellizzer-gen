    "intro": "Cordylanthus rigidus subsp. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal cordylanthus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific coast of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal bluffs and dunes, where it is adapted to salty air and strong winds. It has small, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid coastal environment. This subspecies is often found in association with other coastal flora, contributing to the unique biodiversity of maritime ecosystems."
