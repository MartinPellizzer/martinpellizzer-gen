    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha var. ferox, commonly known as the common hawthorn or sea hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soils but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. This variety is often used in hedgerows and as a ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and seasonal interest."
