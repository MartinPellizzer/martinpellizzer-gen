It is characterized by its delicate, rose-pink to lavender-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and produces small, spurred flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture.
