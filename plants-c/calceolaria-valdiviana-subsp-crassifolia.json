    "intro": "Calceolaria valdiviana subsp. crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved calceolaria, is a species native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive calyx-like labellum, which is often brightly colored and serves as an adaptation for attracting pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, cool environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are thick and leathery, helping it retain moisture in its native habitat. The flowers are usually violet or purple, with a unique shape that aids in specific pollination by insects."
