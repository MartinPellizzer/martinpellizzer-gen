    "intro": "Caesalpinia virgata, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright red or orange flame-like inflorescences that appear during the dry season. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets, and its flowers are typically arranged in dense, rounded clusters. The seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that turn from green to yellow as they mature. Caesalpinia virgata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
