    "intro": "Cenchrus ciliaris var. anachoreticus, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a valuable forage grass for livestock in dry environments. Its ecological importance includes preventing soil erosion and supporting local wildlife."
