    "intro": "Cinnamomum antillarum, commonly known as the Bahamian cinnamon or West Indian cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that lead to dark, berry-like fruits. The plant is valued for its essential oils, which are extracted from its bark and leaves, giving it a distinctive spicy aroma similar to true cinnamon. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental and aromatic qualities, it is cultivated in tropical regions for both commercial and horticultural purposes."
