It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flower heads. This variety is typically found in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, poorly drained soils. The plant produces tiny, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by water or wind. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
