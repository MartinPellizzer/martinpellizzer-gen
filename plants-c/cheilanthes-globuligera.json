    "intro": "Cheilanthes globuligera, commonly known as the globular maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features delicate, fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
