    "intro": "Chrysopappus stapfianus, commonly known as the Stapf's goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that aid in its propagation across open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
