    "intro": "Cystea dentata, commonly known as the serrated sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and its ability to thrive in saline environments. The plant has distinctive serrated leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found growing on rocky shores and sandy beaches, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes. Cystea dentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
