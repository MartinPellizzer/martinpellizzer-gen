    "intro": "Changnienia, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange to red\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that split open to release seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other parts of the world, where it can become invasive. The leaves and seeds contain toxic compounds, making it important to handle with care."
