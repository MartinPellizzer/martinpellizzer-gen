    "intro": "Cotyledon leucothrix, commonly known as the white cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are often variegated with white or yellow markings, adding to its ornamental appeal. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact growth habit."
