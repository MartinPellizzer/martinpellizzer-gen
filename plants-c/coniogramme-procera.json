    "intro": "Coniogramme procera, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant has a complex root system that helps anchor it in shallow water and absorb nutrients. Its fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, which are arranged in a distinctive, fan-like pattern. Coniogramme procera plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by providing shelter for aquatic organisms."
