    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 elegans var. stelzneriana, commonly known as the Stelzner's orchid, is a hybrid orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and often feature a distinctive red lip. The plant is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. It produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical climates. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated for its beauty and fragrance."
