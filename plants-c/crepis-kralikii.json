    "intro": "Crepis kralikii, commonly known as Kralik's mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, often in areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are hairy and spoon-shaped, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Crepis kralikii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
