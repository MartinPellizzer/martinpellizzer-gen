    "intro": "Curculigo villosa, commonly known as the hairy arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Piperaceae and is characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves is a distinguishing feature, contributing to its common name."
