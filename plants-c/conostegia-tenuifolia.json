    "intro": "Conostegia tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender-leafed balsa, is a small evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles. The plant is well adapted to tropical climates and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is also notable for its lightweight wood, which has been historically used in model building and other crafts. However, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its limited size and specific growing requirements."
