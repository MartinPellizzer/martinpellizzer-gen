    "intro": "Cynorkis bosseriana, commonly known as the Bosser's cycad, is a species of cycad native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being ovoid and the male cones cylindrical. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
