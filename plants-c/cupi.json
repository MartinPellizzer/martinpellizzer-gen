    "intro": "Cupi, commonly known as the cupid plant, is a unique species native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. The cupi plant is noted for its short blooming period, usually in the spring, making it a rare and sought-after specimen in botanical gardens."
