    "intro": "Campanula lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Campanula lanceolata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
