    "intro": "Cardamine geifolia, commonly known as the water shield, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are usually floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its small white or greenish flowers appear in clusters and bloom in early spring. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
