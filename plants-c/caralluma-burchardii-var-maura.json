    "intro": "Caralluma burchardii var. maura, commonly known as the Desert Cactus or Maura Cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Pakistan. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss and deter herbivores. This species is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
