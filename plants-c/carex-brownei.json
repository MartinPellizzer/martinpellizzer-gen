    "intro": "Carex brownei, commonly known as Brown's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in wetlands and moist woodland habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. Carex brownei is typically found in shaded, damp environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
