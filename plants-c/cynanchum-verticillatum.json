    "intro": "Cynanchum verticillatum, commonly known as the whorled milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap is a distinctive feature, and it is often found in moist woodland or roadside habitats. Cynanchum verticillatum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is part of the dogbane family (Apocynaceae)."
