    "intro": "Cryophytum suffruticosum, commonly known as the Antarctic hair-crisp, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Antarctica. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in extreme cold and nutrient-poor soils. Its small, white flowers bloom during the brief summer season, and it has a unique ability to survive freezing temperatures by entering a dormant state. The plant's leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help insulate it from the harsh cold. Botanically, it belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is one of the few flowering plants that can survive in such extreme environments."
