    "intro": "Cousinia cynaroides, commonly known as the alpine thistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions. The plant features a rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. It is adapted to high altitudes with a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh climates. Cousinia cynaroides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
