    "intro": "Cypripedium hirsutum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered hare's foot orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
