It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for small garden spaces or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
