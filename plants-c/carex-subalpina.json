    "intro": "Carex subalpina, commonly known as alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine and subalpine environments. It is often found in meadows, stream banks, and rocky areas at high elevations. Carex subalpina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small mammals."
