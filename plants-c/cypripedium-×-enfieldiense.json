    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 enfieldiense, commonly known as the Enfield yellow lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow pouch-shaped flower with a greenish throat and a white lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It has a short, rhizomatous root system and produces a single, erect stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
