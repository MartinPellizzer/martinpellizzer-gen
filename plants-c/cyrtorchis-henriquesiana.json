    "intro": "Cyrtorchis henriquesiana, commonly known as the Henriques' orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Cyrtorchis henriquesiana is often found growing in rocky crevices or on the edges of grasslands. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
