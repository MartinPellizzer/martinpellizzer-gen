    "intro": "Cakile hispanica, commonly known as Spanish sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are rough and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Cakile hispanica is often found in disturbed soils and can be a weed in agricultural settings."
