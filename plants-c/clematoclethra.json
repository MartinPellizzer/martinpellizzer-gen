    "intro": "Clematoclethra, commonly known as the Japanese spurge or Japanese arrowroot, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of only one species, Clematoclethra arborescens, which is native to Japan and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features simple, opposite, and often hairy leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries. Clematoclethra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens."
