    "intro": "Calandrinia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate calandrinia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a low-growing annual herb that produces vibrant pink to red flowers. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
