    "intro": "Crataegus lutea, commonly known as the yellow hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its yellowish-green leaves and small, orange-red fruits that ripen in the fall. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are often followed by the distinctive, thorned branches. Crataegus lutea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
