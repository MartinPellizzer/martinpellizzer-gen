    "intro": "Crocus marandicus, commonly known as the Persian crocus, is a bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a single, erect stem with narrow leaves and has a short, rounded bulb that serves as its storage organ. Its flowers are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of saffron-like pigments. Crocus marandicus thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade."
