It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and vines. The plant is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
