    "intro": "Cuscuta ghindensis, commonly known as the Ghindensis dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, attaching itself with specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers and has a vine-like structure that twines around its host. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host, affecting both agricultural and natural ecosystems."
