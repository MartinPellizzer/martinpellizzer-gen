    "intro": "Carex nigra subsp. carpetana, commonly known as black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream sides. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
