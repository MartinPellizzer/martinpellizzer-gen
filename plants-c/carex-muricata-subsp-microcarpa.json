    "intro": "Carex muricata subsp. microcarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats and supporting local biodiversity."
