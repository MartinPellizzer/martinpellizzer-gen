    "intro": "Cyathea trichophora, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds. The plant has a distinctive trunk covered in a layer of brown, fibrous tissue that resembles bark. Its fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with a long, narrow shape and a soft, velvety texture on the underside. Cyathea trichophora is typically found in moist, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in humid conditions."
