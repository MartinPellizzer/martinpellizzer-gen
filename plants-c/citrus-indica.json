It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow when mature. The plant produces a fragrant, bitter peel that is used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with a serrated edge, and it thrives in warm, tropical climates. Citrus indica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in the cultivation of citrus hybrids."
