    "intro": "Chaetaria affinis, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, slender leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Chaetaria affinis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
