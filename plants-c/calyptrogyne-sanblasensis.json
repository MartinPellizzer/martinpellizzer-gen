It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and distinctive, fleshy, red fruits that contain a single seed. The plant thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove swamps and coastal areas. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
