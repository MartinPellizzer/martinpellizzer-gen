    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 verelii, commonly known as the Verelli's Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid that originates from the cross between Cattleya labiata and Cattleya mossiae. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from pale pink to deep red, with intricate patterns and a prominent lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. Its leaves are broad and dark green, often forming a dense rosette. This hybrid is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and fragrance."
