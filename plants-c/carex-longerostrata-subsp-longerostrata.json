    "intro": "Carex longerostrata subsp. longerostrata, commonly known as the long-beaked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spiky, cylindrical inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its distinctive elongated bracts and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens."
