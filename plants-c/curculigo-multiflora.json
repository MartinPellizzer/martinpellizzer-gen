    "intro": "Curculigo multiflora, commonly known as the African starwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant features dark green, narrow leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks."
