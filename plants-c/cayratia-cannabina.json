    "intro": "Cayratia cannabina, commonly known as the Indian hemp vine, is a climbing plant native to Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, red berries. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its resemblance to Cannabis species, it has been the subject of botanical and legal scrutiny in some regions."
