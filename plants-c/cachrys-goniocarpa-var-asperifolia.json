It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds. This species is often found in moist, sandy soils along the edges of forests and wetlands."
