    "intro": "Cassebeeria velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf cassia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, covered in a soft, velvety pubescence. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal panicles, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some areas."
