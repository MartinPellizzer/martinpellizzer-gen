It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, adapted for water storage. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the spring or early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or containers. It requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
