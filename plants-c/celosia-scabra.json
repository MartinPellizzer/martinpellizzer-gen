    "intro": "Celosia scabra, commonly known as the flame flower or crown of thorns, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is known for its upright growth habit and drought tolerance. Celosia scabra thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms, which can persist for several months during the growing season."
