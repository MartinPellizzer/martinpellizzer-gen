    "intro": "Chamaecerasus xylosteum, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that ripen in the fall, which are edible but often used in jams and preserves. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting wildlife, particularly birds."
