    "intro": "Conyza balsamifera, commonly known as the balsam weed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that emit a strong, unpleasant odor when crushed. It produces small yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seeds, which are easily dispersed by wind. Conyza balsamifera is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
