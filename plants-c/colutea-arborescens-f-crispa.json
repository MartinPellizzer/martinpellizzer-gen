It is a hemiparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients. The plant features a slender, branched stem with small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in clusters, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. This variant is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to grow in shaded environments."
