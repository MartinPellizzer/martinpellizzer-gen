    "intro": "Coprosma rubra, commonly known as the red-fruited coprosma, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for native birds. Coprosma rubra is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for horticultural planting in New Zealand and other regions with a similar climate."
