    "intro": "Crataegus virella, commonly known as the green hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often tart, and they serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are oval-shaped with finely serrated edges, and it is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and open woods. Crataegus virella is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
