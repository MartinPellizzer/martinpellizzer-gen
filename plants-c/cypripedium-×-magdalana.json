    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 magdalana, commonly known as the Magdalene lady's tresses, is a hybrid orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and a tall, slender flowering stem that bears a cluster of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers with prominent yellow sepals and petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires well-drained, acidic soils for optimal growth. It is a perennial herb that blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often pollinated by bees and other insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
