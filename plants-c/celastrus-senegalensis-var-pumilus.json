It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
