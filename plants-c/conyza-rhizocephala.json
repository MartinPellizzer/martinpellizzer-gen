    "intro": "Conyza rhizocephala, commonly known as the common cudweed, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and a hairy, branched stem. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in various parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Conyza rhizocephala is often considered a weed but plays a role in soil stabilization and provides food for certain insects and livestock."
