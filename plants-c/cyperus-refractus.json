    "intro": "Cyperus refractus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikelets are small and clustered, producing tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. Cyperus refractus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
