    "intro": "Conocarpus, commonly known as the buttonwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Combretaceae. It is characterized by its small, round, woody fruits that resemble buttons, hence its common name. The plants typically have simple, opposite leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers. Conocarpus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, Africa, and Asia. They are often found in coastal areas and can tolerate saline conditions, making them important in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
