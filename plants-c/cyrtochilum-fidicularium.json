    "intro": "Cyrtochilum fidicularium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in a spike, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Cyrtochilum fidicularium has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its natural habitat. It is relatively easy to cultivate in a warm, humid greenhouse setting with well-draining soil."
