    "intro": "Colymbada scabiosa var. praealpina, commonly known as the Alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens with rocky or alpine features."
