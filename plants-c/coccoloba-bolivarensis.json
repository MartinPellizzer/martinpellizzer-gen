    "intro": "Coccoloba bolivarensis, commonly known as the Bolivian coccoloba, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru. The plant is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
