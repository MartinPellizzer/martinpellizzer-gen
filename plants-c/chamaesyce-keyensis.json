    "intro": "Chamaesyce keyensis, commonly known as Key's sandspurry, is a low-growing annual herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically features prostrate or ascending stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Chamaesyce keyensis is adapted to sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes."
