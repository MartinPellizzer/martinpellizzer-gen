    "intro": "Cissus flaviflora, commonly known as the golden-flowered cissus, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, succulent stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, white, waxy bumps. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are followed by small, round, green berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cissus flaviflora is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and unique appearance."
