    "intro": "Castilleja fissifolia var. breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reddish to orange-colored stems and leaves. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with certain fungi, which help it absorb water and nutrients from the soil. Its small, tubular flowers are typically pink to purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. Castilleja fissifolia var. breviflora is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe."
