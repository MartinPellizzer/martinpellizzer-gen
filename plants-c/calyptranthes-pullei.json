    "intro": "Calyptranthes pullei, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on the branches of other trees, drawing water and nutrients from its host. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Calyptranthes pullei is an important component of Hawaii's unique ecosystem, though it is threatened by habitat loss and invasive species."
