    "intro": "Cerastium mollissimum var. diffusum, commonly known as velvet cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are soft and velvety to the touch. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are typically five-petaled. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
