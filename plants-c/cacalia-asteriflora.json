    "intro": "Cacalia asteriflora, commonly known as the star-flowered cacalia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of many small florets. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Cacalia asteriflora is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
