It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, featuring a cup-like calyx that encloses the reproductive organs. The plant typically grows in wet, muddy habitats, such as marshes and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. The flowers are small and often pale in color, contributing to its subtle aesthetic in its natural environment."
