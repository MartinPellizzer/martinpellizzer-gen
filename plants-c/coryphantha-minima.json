    "intro": "Coryphantha minima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico and the southwestern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 10-15 centimeters and has a rounded, segmented stem that is often covered in a whitish coating. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
