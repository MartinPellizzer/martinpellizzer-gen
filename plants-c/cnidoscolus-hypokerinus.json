It is characterized by its compound leaves with spiny margins and a distinctive, pungent odor similar to that of horseradish. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are often used in local cuisines. Its roots contain compounds that have been traditionally used for medicinal purposes. However, the plant can be toxic if consumed in large quantities, requiring caution in its use."
