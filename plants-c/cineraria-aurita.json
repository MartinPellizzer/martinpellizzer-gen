    "intro": "Cineraria aurita, commonly known as the ear-shaped cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, ear-like leaves and showy blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cineraria aurita is popular as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
