    "intro": "Corchorus prostratus, commonly known as bladderleaf or prostrate dock, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes, and lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods that burst to disperse seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in wet meadows. Botanically, it is notable for its unique seed dispersal mechanism and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
