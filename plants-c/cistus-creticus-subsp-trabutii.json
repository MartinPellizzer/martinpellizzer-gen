    "intro": "Cistus creticus subsp. trabutii, commonly known as the Cretan rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value. The subspecies trabutii is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different floral characteristics compared to other Cistus species."
