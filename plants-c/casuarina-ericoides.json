    "intro": "Casuarina ericoides, commonly known as the coastal casuarina, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique foliage, consisting of dense, needle-like leaves that form cylindrical clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often forming dense thickets. Casuarina ericoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
