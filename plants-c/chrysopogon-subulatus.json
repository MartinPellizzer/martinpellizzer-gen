    "intro": "Chrysopogon subulatus, commonly known as the slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to withstand drought and poor nutrient conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
