    "intro": "Callicarpa americana f. lactea, commonly known as the white-berried beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces showy, pink to purple berries that mature in the fall, which are a key feature in its ornamental value. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, turning red in the autumn. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often cultivated for its attractive foliage and berries."
