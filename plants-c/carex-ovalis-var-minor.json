    "intro": "Carex ovalis var. minor, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in three rows, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are usually found in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
