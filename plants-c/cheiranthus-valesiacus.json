    "intro": "Cheiranthus valesiacus, commonly known as the Alpine winter cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It has hairy stems and leaves that are often lobed, and it blooms from late winter to early spring. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
