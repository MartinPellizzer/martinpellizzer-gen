    "intro": "Centaurea virgata var. squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly centaury, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and showy, bright yellow to orange-red flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The variety 'squarrosa' is distinguished by its dense, woolly appearance, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions."
