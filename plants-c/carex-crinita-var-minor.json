    "intro": "Carex crinita var. minor, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial sedge native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in full to partial sun and requires consistent moisture, making it a popular choice for wetland restoration projects. Its dense growth habit helps stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
