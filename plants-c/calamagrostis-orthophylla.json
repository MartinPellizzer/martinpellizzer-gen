    "intro": "Calamagrostis orthophylla, commonly known as the upright bluejoint grass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This plant thrives in wet to moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. Calamagrostis orthophylla is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
