    "intro": "Canarium polyphyllum, commonly known as the white-flowered candlenut, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves with lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, three-angled fruits containing oily seeds. Canarium polyphyllum is valued for its oil-rich seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of biofuel. It also plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems."
