    "intro": "Carex carltoniana, commonly known as the Carlton sedge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. This plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its grass-like leaves are usually dark green and have a triangular cross-section, a characteristic feature of many sedges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer, contributing to its ecological value in wetland habitats."
