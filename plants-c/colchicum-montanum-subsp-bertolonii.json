    "intro": "Colchicum montanum subsp. bertolonii, commonly known as the Alpine colchic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking purple to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a bulbous corm, which serves as its primary storage organ. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
