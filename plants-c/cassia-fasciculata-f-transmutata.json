    "intro": "Cassia fasciculata f. transmutata, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a variant of the cassia genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow inflorescences that resemble cascading showers of light. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically growing up to 5 meters in height. Its leaves are bipinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a feathery pattern. The flowers, which bloom in summer, are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
