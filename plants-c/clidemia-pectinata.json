    "intro": "Clidemia pectinata, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and typically grows on the branches of other woody plants, deriving some of its nutrients from its host. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowers are usually white or pink, clustered in terminal inflorescences. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants if left unchecked."
