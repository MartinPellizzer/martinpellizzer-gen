    "intro": "Calliandra lewisii, commonly known as the honey mesquite, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has bipinnately compound leaves, which are divided into small leaflets, and it produces small, legume-like pods that contain seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Calliandra lewisii is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, improving soil fertility."
