    "intro": "Cytisus ratisbonensis var. microphyllus, commonly known as the dwarf broom, is a compact shrub native to the British Isles. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in marginal areas."
