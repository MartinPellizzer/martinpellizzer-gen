    "intro": "Carex involucrata var. submuricata, commonly known as the rough-fruited sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical inflorescences with small, spike-like flowers. Its fruiting structures, called achenes, are often covered in a rough, scaly texture, giving it the specific epithet *submuricata*. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
