    "intro": "Calceolaria abscondita, commonly known as the hidden slipper orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its delicate structure and specialized morphology make it well adapted to its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
