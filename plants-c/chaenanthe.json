It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences. The plants typically grow as herbaceous perennials, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Chaenanthe species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique and colorful blooms. They thrive in moist, well-drained soils and require partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
