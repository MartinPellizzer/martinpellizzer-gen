    "intro": "Catopsis werckleana, commonly known as the Werckleana moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a dense, cushion-like structure with closely packed leaves that are usually a dull green color. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature. Catopsis werckleana is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention."
