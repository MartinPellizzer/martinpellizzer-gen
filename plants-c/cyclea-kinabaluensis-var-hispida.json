    "intro": "Cyclea kinabaluensis var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy cyclea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive hairy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in montane forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it faces threats to its survival in the wild."
