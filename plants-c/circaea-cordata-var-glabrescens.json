    "intro": "Circaea cordata var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has slender, upright stems covered with glandular hairs, which give it a slightly sticky texture. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a distinctive waxy coating. This variant is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to the typical form, contributing to its common name."
