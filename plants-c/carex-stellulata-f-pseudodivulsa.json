    "intro": "Carex stellulata f. pseudodivulsa, commonly known as the star sedge, is a low-growing, rhizomatous sedge native to eastern North America. It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green, with a slightly bluish tint. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are borne in spikelets along the stems. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This ornamental plant is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic insects."
