    "intro": "Centotheca maxima, commonly known as the giant centotheca, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Centotheca maxima is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
