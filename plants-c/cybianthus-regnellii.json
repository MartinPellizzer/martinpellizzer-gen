    "intro": "Cybianthus regnellii, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Cybianthus regnellii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
