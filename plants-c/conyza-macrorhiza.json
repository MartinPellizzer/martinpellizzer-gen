    "intro": "Conyza macrorhiza, commonly known as rough blueweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It features slender, branched stems and hairy leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, blue to purple composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. Conyza macrorhiza is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats including roadsides and fields."
