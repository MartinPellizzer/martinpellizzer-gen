It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can reach up to 10 feet in height. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, typically in summer. Its thick, spiny stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.
