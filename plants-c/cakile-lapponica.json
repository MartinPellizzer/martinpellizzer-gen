    "intro": "Cakile lapponica, commonly known as Arctic groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in cold, harsh environments, often found on tundra and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in nutrient-poor soils. Cakile lapponica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for various herbivorous insects and small animals."
