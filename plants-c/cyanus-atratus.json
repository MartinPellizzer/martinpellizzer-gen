    "intro": "Cyanus atratus, commonly known as the black-eyed Susan, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its striking yellow petals with a deep black center, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open fields and along roadsides, thriving in full sunlight. It produces small, seed-filled cones that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Cyanus atratus is a hardy perennial that blooms in the summer months, adding vibrant color to gardens and natural landscapes."
