    "intro": "Cyclosorus pennigerus, commonly known as the broad-leaved water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Asia. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like structure, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and has floating leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its reproductive system involves the production of small, yellowish flowers that emerge from the water surface. Cyclosorus pennigerus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
