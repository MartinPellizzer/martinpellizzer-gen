    "intro": "Colocynthis, commonly known as the bitter apple or wild cucumber, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is a shrub or small tree native to the deserts of North Africa, the Middle East, and parts of southern Europe. The plant produces yellow, fleshy fruits that contain a toxic, bitter substance called colocynthin. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the stems are covered in spiny projections. Colocynthis is often used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to the toxicity of its parts."
