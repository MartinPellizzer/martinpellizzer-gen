    "intro": "Calamagrostis mollis, commonly known as silky blue grass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage that adds a striking visual appeal to gardens. The plant produces tall, slender panicles of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Calamagrostis mollis is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
