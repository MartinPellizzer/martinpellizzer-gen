    "intro": "Calophyllum edule, commonly known as the edible mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and broad, glossy leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that give way to orange-red fruits containing several seeds. The fruit is edible when ripe, with a sweet, fleshy pulp that is often consumed fresh or processed into jams and beverages. It also has traditional medicinal uses and is valued for its timber."
