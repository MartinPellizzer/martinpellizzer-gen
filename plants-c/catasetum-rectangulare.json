    "intro": "Catasetum rectangulare, commonly known as the rectangular catasetum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, elongated pseudobulbs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with dark markings. Its flowers are unique in that they have a specialized structure called a \"labellum\" which is modified to aid in pollination by specific insect species. Catasetum rectangulare is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a warm, humid environment."
