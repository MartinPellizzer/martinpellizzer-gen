    "intro": "Carex nigra var. bina, commonly known as black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and dense, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet to moist habitats such as swamps, bogs, and along stream edges. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and it thrives in full to partial shade. Carex nigra var. bina is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and ability to stabilize soil."
