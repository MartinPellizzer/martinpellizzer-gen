    "intro": "Corrigiola telephiifolia subsp. imbricata, commonly known as the rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, succulent leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to conserve water in harsh conditions. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store moisture, making it well-suited for dry climates. The subspecies imbricata is distinguished by its tightly overlapping leaf arrangement, which provides additional protection against wind and sun."
