    "intro": "Cyathochaeta avenacea, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with fine, hairy structures along the stems. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in tufts, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Cyathochaeta avenacea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
