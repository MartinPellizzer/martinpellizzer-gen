    "intro": "Crepis macrorhiza, commonly known as the large-headed mouse-ear, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a single head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a compact growth habit and is typically less than 30 cm tall. The species is noted for its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments."
