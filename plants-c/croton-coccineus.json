    "intro": "Croton coccineus, commonly known as the scarlet croton, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, palmate leaves that display a range of colors from green to red and yellow, depending on the stage of growth. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
