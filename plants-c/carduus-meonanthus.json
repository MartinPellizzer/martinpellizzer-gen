    "intro": "Carduus meonanthus, commonly known as the meadow thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, purple or violet flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are surrounded by a series of bracts that form a distinctive crown.
