It is characterized by its striking, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are often brightly colored in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing tiny, round seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy texture."
