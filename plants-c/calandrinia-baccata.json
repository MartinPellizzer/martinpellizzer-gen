    "intro": "Calandrinia baccata, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, exhibiting succulent leaves that help it conserve water. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Calandrinia baccata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
