    "intro": "Critho aegiceras, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea apple, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests and estuaries. The plant has woody stems and produces small, white flowers that are followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. Its leaves are alternate and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Critho aegiceras plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
