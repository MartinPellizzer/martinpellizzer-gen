It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its botanical features include a basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that rises above the foliage. Chaptalia rotundifolia is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to cold, arid climates."
