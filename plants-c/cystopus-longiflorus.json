    "intro": "Cystopus longiflorus, commonly known as the long-flowered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, delicate, often yellowish flowers. The plant is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it floats or is submerged. It possesses specialized structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on aquatic plant adaptations and ecological interactions."
