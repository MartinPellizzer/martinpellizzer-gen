    "intro": "Carex hitchcockii, commonly known as Hitchcock's sedge, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. This species typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands or meadows. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hitchcock's sedge is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
