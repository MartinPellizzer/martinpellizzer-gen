    "intro": "Cypripedium caricinum, commonly known as the dwarf lady's slipper, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique pouch-shaped lip, which is a distinguishing feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white, with a subtle fragrance that aids in pollination by insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
