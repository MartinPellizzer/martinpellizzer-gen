    "intro": "Caruelina filipes, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, thread-like leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its flowering structures are small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Caruelina filipes plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
