    "intro": "Carex stenostachys var. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
