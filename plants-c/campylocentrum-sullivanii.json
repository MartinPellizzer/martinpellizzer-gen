    "intro": "Campylocentrum sullivanii, commonly known as the Sullivan's lantern plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its striking, lantern-shaped inflorescences that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is known for its aromatic leaves and showy flowers that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
