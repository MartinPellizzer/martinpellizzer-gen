    "intro": "Crepis junodiana, commonly known as the Junod's hawk's-beard, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the alpine regions of southern Europe and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution in mountainous areas. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
