    "intro": "Cyperus fuscus var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale cyperus, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedge plants, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clustered flower heads. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in shallow water or damp soil. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often arranged in spikelets, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variant is distinguished by its pale green coloration and slightly reduced stature compared to other Cyperus species."
