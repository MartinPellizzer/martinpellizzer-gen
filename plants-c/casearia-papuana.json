    "intro": "Casearia papuana, commonly known as the Papuan casearia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Islands, including Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are red when mature. Its botanical features make it an important species in local ecosystems, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native range."
