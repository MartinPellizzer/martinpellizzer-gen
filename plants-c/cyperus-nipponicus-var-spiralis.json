    "intro": "Cyperus nipponicus var. spiralis, commonly known as the spiral flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and distinctive spiraling inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a unique, curling appearance that sets it apart from other sedge species. It is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ecological value in wetland restoration."
