It is characterized by its upright growth habit and simple, alternate leaves that are usually smooth and glabrous. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in dry, temperate climates. This subspecies is often grown for its ornamental value and as a source of oil-rich seeds."
