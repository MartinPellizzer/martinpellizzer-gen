    "intro": "Columbaria, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can range in color from white to deep pink, often with a yellow or red center. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the muddy substrate. Columbaria thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often associated with spiritual and cultural symbolism. Its blooming cycle is seasonal, typically occurring during the warmer months of the year."
