It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful flowers with intricate patterns and a unique, hooded structure that protects its reproductive organs. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, thriving in rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers emit a mild scent, attracting specific pollinators such as flies and beetles. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
