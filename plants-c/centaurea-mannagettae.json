    "intro": "Centaurea mannagettae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to the harsh, alpine conditions of its environment. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Centaurea mannagettae is considered a rare and endangered species."
