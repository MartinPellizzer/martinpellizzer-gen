    "intro": "Cyrtococcum pilipes, commonly known as the velvet cup fungus, is a small, cup-shaped fungus with a distinctive velvety texture. It belongs to the family Cortinariaceae and is characterized by its dark, chestnut-colored cap and a slim, cylindrical stem. The fungus typically grows in association with decaying wood, often found in forested areas. It is notable for its subtle, earthy aroma and its role in decomposing organic matter. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often overlooked in fungal studies."
