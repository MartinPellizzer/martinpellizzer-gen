    "intro": "Castilleja seibertii, commonly known as the Seibert's paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its showy, red-orange bracts that resemble paintbrushes, giving it its common name. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and open forests. Castilleja seibertii is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while still performing photosynthesis."
