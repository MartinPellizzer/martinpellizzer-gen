    "intro": "Calanthe angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant, orchid flowers. The plant typically features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces spikes of showy, tubular flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Calanthe angusta thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural collections and conservation efforts."
