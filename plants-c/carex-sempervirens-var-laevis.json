    "intro": "Carex sempervirens var. laevis, commonly known as the silky sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, arching leaves that are soft to the touch due to their silky texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and shaded woodland areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
