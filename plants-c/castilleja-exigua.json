    "intro": "Castilleja exigua, commonly known as the smallleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its root system to parasitize the roots of neighboring plants for nutrients. Its structure consists of a short stem with whorled bracts and a single, erect flower cluster. Castilleja exigua plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its habitat."
