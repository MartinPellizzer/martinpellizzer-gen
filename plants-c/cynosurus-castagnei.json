    "intro": "Cynosurus castagnei, commonly known as the Castagnei's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
