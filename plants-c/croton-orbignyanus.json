    "intro": "Croton orbignyanus, commonly known as the golden croton, is a striking tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that often display vibrant yellow, orange, and red hues. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in panicle inflorescences, which are followed by distinctive, woody, spiny capsules. Its ornamental value is largely due to its showy foliage, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it is important to note that it can be toxic if ingested, requiring careful handling."
