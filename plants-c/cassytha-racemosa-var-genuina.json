    "intro": "Cassytha racemosa var. genuina, commonly known as the slender grape vine, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by dark, berry-like fruits. Its stems are often covered in tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes, which aid in climbing. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks."
