    "intro": "Calligonum inaequale, commonly known as the unequal sandspurry, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy stems that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve moisture in harsh environments. Calligonum inaequale is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to dry, coastal or inland dunes."
