    "intro": "Calystegia amurensis, commonly known as the Amur morning glory, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Its rapid growth habit makes it both an ornamental plant and a potential weed. The species is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
