It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a glandular surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.
