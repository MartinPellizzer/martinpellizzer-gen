    "intro": "Cirsium eriophilus, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has spiny, lobed leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its purple to pink flower heads consist of both ray and disk florets, typical of the genus Cirsium. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands."
