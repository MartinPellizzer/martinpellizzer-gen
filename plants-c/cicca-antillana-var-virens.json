    "intro": "Cicca antillana var. virens, commonly known as the green cicca, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the Caribbean region, particularly found in parts of the Greater Antilles. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom during the dry season. It typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native habitat."
