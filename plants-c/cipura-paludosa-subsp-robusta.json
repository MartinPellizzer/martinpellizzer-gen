    "intro": "Cipura paludosa subsp. robusta, commonly known as the swamp cipura, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in South America. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and dense, dark green foliage that thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Due to its preference for specific environmental conditions, it is often found in areas with consistent water levels and high humidity."
