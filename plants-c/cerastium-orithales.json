It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its growth habit is mat-forming, with stems that often lie close to the ground. Cerastium orithales is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through stolons, making it a common sight in damp, temperate regions."
