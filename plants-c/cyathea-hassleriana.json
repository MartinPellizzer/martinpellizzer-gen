    "intro": "Cyathea hassleriana, commonly known as the Hassler\u2019s tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer. The plant has large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, with a deep green coloration. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its rhizome system allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Cyathea hassleriana is often found in humid forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological significance."
