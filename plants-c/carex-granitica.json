    "intro": "Carex granitica, commonly known as the granite sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils, often found in mountainous regions. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces wind-pollinated flowers, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Carex granitica is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh, rocky habitats."
