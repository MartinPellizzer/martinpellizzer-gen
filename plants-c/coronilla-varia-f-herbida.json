    "intro": "Coronilla varia f. herbida, commonly known as the slender crownvetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its soft, herbaceous stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, oblong pods containing several seeds. It is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
