    "intro": "Carex lamarckii, commonly known as the Lamarck's sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex lamarckii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
