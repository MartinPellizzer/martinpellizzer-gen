It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. This form is distinguished by its elongated, attenuated growth habit compared to the standard lily of the valley. It is native to parts of Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
