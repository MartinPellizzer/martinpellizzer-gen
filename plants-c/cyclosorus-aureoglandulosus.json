    "intro": "Cyclosorus aureoglandulosus, commonly known as the golden glandular cyclosorus, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in golden-yellow glands, giving it its common name. It is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its entire surface. Cyclosorus aureoglandulosus is primarily distributed in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
