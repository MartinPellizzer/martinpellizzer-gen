    "intro": "Carex mira var. obovato-oblonga, commonly known as the broad-ovate sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender, leafy stems. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
