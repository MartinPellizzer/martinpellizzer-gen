    "intro": "Coleobotrys cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical leaching plant, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in length. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its flowers are small and clustered in umbels. This species is notable for its ability to exude a milky sap, which has been used in traditional medicine."
