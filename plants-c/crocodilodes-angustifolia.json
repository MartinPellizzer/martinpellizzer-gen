It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens across southern Europe."
