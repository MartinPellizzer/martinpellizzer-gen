    "intro": "Copiapoa cupreata, commonly known as the copper cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its short, columnar stem and dense, spiny growth. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green or copper-colored body. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stem and having a slow growth rate. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant."
