    "intro": "Cereus chacoanus, commonly known as the Chaco candleplant, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to northern South America. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a spiny, ribbed stem that can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant is often cultivated for its striking appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with minimal water."
