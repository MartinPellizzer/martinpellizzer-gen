It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of fragrant, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are arranged oppositely on the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Ceanothus officinalis is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
