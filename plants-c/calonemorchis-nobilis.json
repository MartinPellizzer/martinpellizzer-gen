    "intro": "Calonemorchis nobilis, commonly known as the noble calonemorchis, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade. Its growth is slow, and it requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
