    "intro": "Chondrodendron, commonly known as the \"moonflower\" or \"night-blooming cereus,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the cacti family, Cactaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly the Andean regions, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Chondrodendron species are characterized by their spiny stems and showy, nocturnal flowers that open at night and emit a fragrant scent. The flowers are typically white or pale in color, and they attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. Due to their unique blooming habits and striking appearance, these plants are popular among cactus enthusiasts and are often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
