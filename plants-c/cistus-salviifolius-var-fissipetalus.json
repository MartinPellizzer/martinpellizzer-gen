    "intro": "Cistus salviifolius var. fissipetalus, commonly known as the fissipetalus rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its silver-green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for Mediterranean climates. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinators."
