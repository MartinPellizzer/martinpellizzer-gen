    "intro": "Cymbidium erythraeum, commonly known as the Red Cymbidium, is a species of orchid native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often with a contrasting lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, forming a rosette that helps it conserve moisture. This orchid thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
