    "intro": "Cuscuta parviflora var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemded dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers and has a distinctive appearance with long, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed through the wind, allowing it to colonize new areas readily. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host, making it a significant concern in agricultural settings."
