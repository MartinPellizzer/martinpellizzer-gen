    "intro": "Cardamine fontana, commonly known as the water shield, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. Cardamine fontana plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
