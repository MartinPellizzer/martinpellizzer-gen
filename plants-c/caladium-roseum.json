    "intro": "Caladium roseum, commonly known as the pink-leaf caladium, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that display a variety of pink, red, and white colorations. The leaves are typically broad and have a velvety texture, making them visually appealing. It thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers partial to full shade. This ornamental plant is often used in gardens for its vibrant foliage rather than its small, inconspicuous flowers."
