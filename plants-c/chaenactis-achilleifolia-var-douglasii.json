It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a low, sprawling growth habit. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is known for its showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall."
