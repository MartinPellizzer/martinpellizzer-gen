It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed structure and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are typically borne near the base of the stems. It has adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with deep roots and thick, waxy skin to store water. Coryphantha vaupeliana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
