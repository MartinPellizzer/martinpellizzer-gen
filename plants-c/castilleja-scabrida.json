    "intro": "Castilleja scabrida, commonly known as the scabrous milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and relies on the roots of other plants for some of its nutrients. The plant is characterized by its reddish to orange-yellow flowers and hairy, often scabrous stems and leaves. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in nutrient cycling and can influence the composition of plant communities."
