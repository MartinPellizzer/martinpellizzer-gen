    "intro": "Corydalis adunca subsp. microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded corydalis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and clusters of small, delicate flowers. The flowers are typically pink or purple, with two upper petals that are spurred at the base. The plant produces small, rounded seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize rocky and dry habitats. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
