    "intro": "Chamaecyparis obtusa var. aurea-nana, commonly known as the Japanese dwarf golden cypress, is a compact, slow-growing coniferous shrub native to Japan. It features dense, feathery foliage that turns a striking golden yellow in full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant has scale-like leaves that are bright gold on the upper surface and a silvery-white underside, creating a striking visual contrast. It produces small, inconspicuous cones and is often used in rock gardens or as a specimen plant in landscaped settings. This variety is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, acidic soil."
