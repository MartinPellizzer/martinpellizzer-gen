    "intro": "Carex norvegica var. isostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, a common reproductive strategy among sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
