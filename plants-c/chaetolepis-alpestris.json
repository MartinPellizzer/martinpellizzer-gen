    "intro": "Chaetolepis alpestris, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Due to its resilience and ability to colonize alpine environments, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
