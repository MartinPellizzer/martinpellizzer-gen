    "intro": "Chlorophytum kolhapurense, commonly known as the Kolhapur snake plant, is a perennial herb native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a silvery stripe running down the center. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and survive in arid environments. This species is also valued for its air-purifying properties, contributing to improved indoor air quality."
