    "intro": "Crucifera sisymbrium, commonly known as wild radish, is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are usually bright yellow or white, and it produces small, round seeds in a dry, three-lobed pod. Wild radish is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine and as a food source."
