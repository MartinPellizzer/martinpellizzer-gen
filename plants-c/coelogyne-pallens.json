    "intro": "Coelogyne pallens, commonly known as the white lady orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near the base of trees or on rocky substrates. The plant produces striking white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent, which helps attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. Coelogyne pallens is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
