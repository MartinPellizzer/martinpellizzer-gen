    "intro": "Championella dalzielii, commonly known as the Dalziel's champion, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a distinctive, feathery appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
