    "intro": "Carex myosurus, commonly known as mouse-tail sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Carex myosurus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
