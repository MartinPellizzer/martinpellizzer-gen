    "intro": "Capsella rubelloagrestis, commonly known as the redstem weed, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other well-known plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, reddish stems, which give it its common name. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily in new areas."
