    "intro": "Cerasus bifrons var. pedicellata, commonly known as the pedicellate cherry, is a variant of the Japanese cherry tree. It is characterized by its distinctive pedicellate (stalked) flowers, which are often more showy than those of the typical variety. The plant is native to Japan and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. It produces small, edible fruits that are similar to other cherry species. This variety is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than for commercial fruit production."
