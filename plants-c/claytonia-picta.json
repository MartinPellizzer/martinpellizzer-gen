    "intro": "Claytonia picta, commonly known as the painted leaf sorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, oval leaves that are often adorned with striking red, purple, or green markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by kidney-shaped seeds. Claytonia picta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Its unique leaf patterns and adaptability make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland gardens."
