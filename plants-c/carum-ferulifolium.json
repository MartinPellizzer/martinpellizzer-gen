    "intro": "Carum ferulifolium, commonly known as Western fennel, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, aromatic leaves with a distinctive fern-like appearance, giving it its species name *ferulifolium*. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in umbels, which are typical of the Apiaceae family. Its seeds are used in culinary applications, similar to those of fennel, and have a mild anise-like flavor. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
