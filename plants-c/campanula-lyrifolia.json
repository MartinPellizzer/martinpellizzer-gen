    "intro": "Campanula lyrifolia, commonly known as the lyrical bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to August. The plant features upright, branching stems covered in soft, hairy leaves that are often lance-shaped or ovate. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and bear clusters of flowers at the tips. Campanula lyrifolia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
