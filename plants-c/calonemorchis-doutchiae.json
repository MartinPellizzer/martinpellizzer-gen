    "intro": "Calonemorchis doutchiae, commonly known as the Doutch's calonemorchis, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a compact growth habit with a short, stocky stem and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
