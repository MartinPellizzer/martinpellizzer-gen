    "intro": "Cnidoscolus rotundifolius, commonly known as the Mexican bristleleaf or giant nettle, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its roots contain a toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, making it a caustic plant. Despite its harmful properties, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal effects."
