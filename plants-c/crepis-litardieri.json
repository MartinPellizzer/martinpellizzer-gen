    "intro": "Crepis litardieri, commonly known as the litardier's mouse-ear, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation across its natural habitat. Crepis litardieri is often found in open, sunny areas at high altitudes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
