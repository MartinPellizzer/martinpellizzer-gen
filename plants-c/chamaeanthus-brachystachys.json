    "intro": "Chamaeanthus brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stalked snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and somewhat woody. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chamaeanthus brachystachys is considered a species of conservation concern."
