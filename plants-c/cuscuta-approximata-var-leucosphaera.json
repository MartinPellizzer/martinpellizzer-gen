    "intro": "Cuscuta approximata var. leucosphaera, commonly known as the white globe dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, white, spherical flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant's stems are yellow to orange in color and have a distinctive, thread-like appearance. It is often found parasitizing a variety of herbaceous plants in open habitats. Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions as a parasite."
