    "intro": "Celsia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly celsia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a fuzzy appearance, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Celsia tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
