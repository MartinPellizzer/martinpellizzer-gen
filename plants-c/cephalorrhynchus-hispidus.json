    "intro": "Cephalorrhynchus hispidus, commonly known as the hairy-headed orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, hairy-appearing inflorescence. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, elongated shape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or in dense undergrowth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
