It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with vibrant, colorful patterns in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the main ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for garden displays and container planting. It is typically grown as an annual in temperate regions due to its sensitivity to frost."
