    "intro": "Cybianthus collinus, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a violet or purple tinge. It thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. Cybianthus collinus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing nectar for pollinators."
