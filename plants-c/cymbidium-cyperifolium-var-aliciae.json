    "intro": "Cymbidium cyperifolium var. aliciae, commonly known as the Alicia's Cymbidium, is a striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a silvery underside. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive yellow lip that adds to its ornamental appeal. This variety is prized for its elegant appearance and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses. It thrives in cool, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
