    "intro": "Cyathea obliqua, commonly known as the oblique tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a robust rhizome system that helps anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue-green glow at night. Cyathea obliqua is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and adaptability to humid climates."
