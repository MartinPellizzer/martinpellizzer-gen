    "intro": "Cyclopogon macer, commonly known as the slender cyclopogon, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure with narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. Its inflorescence consists of a single, short flower spike bearing small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Cyclopogon macer is adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories where it thrives on the nutrients provided by decaying organic matter."
