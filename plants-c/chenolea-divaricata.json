    "intro": "Chenolea divaricata, commonly known as the variable chenopod, is a species of flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its succulent, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. It produces greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Chenolea divaricata is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
