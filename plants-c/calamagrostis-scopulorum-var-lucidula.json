    "intro": "Calamagrostis scopulorum var. lucidula, commonly known as the shining wood reed, is a tall, grass-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered with a waxy coating. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch of color to its habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas. Due to its unique appearance and habitat preferences, it is a valuable plant for ecological studies and landscape design."
