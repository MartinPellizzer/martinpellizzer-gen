    "intro": "Chenopodium album subsp. diversifolium, commonly known as lambsquarters, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that vary in size and shape, often with a bluish-gray hue due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, gardens, and along roadsides. This species is known for its nutritional value and has been used in traditional medicine and as a food source."
