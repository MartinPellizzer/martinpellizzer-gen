It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in coastal or brackish water environments, showcasing its adaptability to saline conditions. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy or muddy substrates. Ctenopteris firma is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
