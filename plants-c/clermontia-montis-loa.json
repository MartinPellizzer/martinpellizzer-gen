    "intro": "Clermontia montis-loa, commonly known as the Loa mountain clermonthe, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Moloka\u02bbi. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forested areas with high humidity. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of hair. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Clermontia montis-loa is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in Hawaii."
