    "intro": "Comocladia cuneata, commonly known as the narrowleaf comocladia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its slender, alternate leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Comocladia cuneata is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in pine flatwoods."
