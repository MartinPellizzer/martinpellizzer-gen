    "intro": "Campanula sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The plant is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its attractive blooms and hardy nature."
