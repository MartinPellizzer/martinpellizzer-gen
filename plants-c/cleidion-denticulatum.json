It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its bark is thick and often fissured, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The plant is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and its potential economic value in certain regions."
