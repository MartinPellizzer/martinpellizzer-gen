    "intro": "Coprosma areolata, commonly known as the spotted coprosma, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers followed by bright red berries that are a striking feature of the species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Coprosma areolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
