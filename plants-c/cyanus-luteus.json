It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which are typically borne in clusters at the top of the plant. The plant has basal leaves that are broadly lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Cyanus luteus is an annual herb that plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
