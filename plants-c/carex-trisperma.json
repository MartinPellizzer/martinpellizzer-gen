    "intro": "Carex trisperma, commonly known as the three-seeded sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-seeded fruits, giving it its scientific name. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Carex trisperma plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
