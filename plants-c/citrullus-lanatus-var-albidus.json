    "intro": "Citrullus lanatus var. albidus, commonly known as the white cucumber, is a variant of the watermelon species characterized by its pale green to white rind and pale yellow to white flesh. This variety is typically smaller than the standard watermelon and has a higher water content, making it refreshing and hydrating. The plant is an annual vine with palmate leaves and produces yellow flowers that are often self-pollinated. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its mild flavor and high water content, it is often used in salads and beverages."
