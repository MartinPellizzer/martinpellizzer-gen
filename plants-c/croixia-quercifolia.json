    "intro": "Croixia quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of an oak tree, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Croixia quercifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
