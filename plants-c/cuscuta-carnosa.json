    "intro": "Cuscuta carnosa, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and can be found growing on a variety of plants, including grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread widely. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked."
