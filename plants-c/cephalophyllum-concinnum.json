    "intro": "Cephalophyllum concinnum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is a small, low-growing cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a short, thick stem and a cluster of fleshy, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stem and having spines for protection. Its flowers are often described as resembling ghostly apparitions due to their ethereal color and shape. Cephalophyllum concinnum is also notable for its ability to produce seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in harsh desert conditions."
