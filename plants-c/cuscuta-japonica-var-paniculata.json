    "intro": "Cuscuta japonica var. paniculata, commonly known as Japanese dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its slender, thread-like stems can\u7f20\u7ed5 around various host species. The plant is native to East Asia and is often found growing on crops such as soybeans and rice. It has a rapid growth rate and can cause significant damage to agricultural yields. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, making it a challenging weed to control."
