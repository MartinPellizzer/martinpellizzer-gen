    "intro": "Commiphora namibensis, commonly known as the Namibian myrrh tree, is a small shrub or tree native to the Namib Desert in Namibia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces a resinous gum, which has been historically used for medicinal and aromatic purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme drought conditions. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
