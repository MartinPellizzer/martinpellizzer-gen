    "intro": "Carissa coriacea, commonly known as the yellow bell tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a slightly sour taste. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Carissa coriacea is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract birds and insects."
