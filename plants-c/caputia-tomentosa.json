    "intro": "Caputia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly caputia, is a small herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in shades of pink or purple, and bloom during the warmer months. Caputia tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique texture and color."
