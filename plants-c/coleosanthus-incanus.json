It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that are covered in fine, silver-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in coastal regions. Its fronds can reach lengths of up to two meters, making it a dramatic addition to any landscape. The silver hair fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
