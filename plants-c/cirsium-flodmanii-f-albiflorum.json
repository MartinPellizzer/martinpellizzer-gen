    "intro": "Cirsium flodmanii f. albiflorum, commonly known as the whiteflower thistle, is a rare horticultural form of the common thistle. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical purple or blue hues of the species. The plant is a perennial herb with spiny leaves and a robust root system, typical of the Cirsium genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its unique floral coloration, it is highly valued in specialty gardens and botanical collections."
