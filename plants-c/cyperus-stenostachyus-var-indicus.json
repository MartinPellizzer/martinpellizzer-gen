    "intro": "Cyperus stenostachyus var. indicus, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Poaceae family, though it is often classified under the Cyperaceae family due to its grass-like appearance. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found in disturbed soils near water bodies. Its botanical characteristics make it adaptable to various aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
