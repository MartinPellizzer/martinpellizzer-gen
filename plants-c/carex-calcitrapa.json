    "intro": "Carex calcitrapa, commonly known as the limestone sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny brown flowers. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. It is typically found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Carex calcitrapa is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity in its native habitats."
