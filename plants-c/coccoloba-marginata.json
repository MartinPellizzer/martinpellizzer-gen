It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America, typically growing in wetland or coastal areas. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves with a distinctive white or silver margin, which helps in identifying it.

The species is also known for its ability to tolerate saline conditions, making it suitable for coastal landscapes."
