It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of the trunk and allows for the development of new shoots. Cyathea gracilis plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
