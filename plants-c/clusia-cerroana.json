    "intro": "Clusia cerroana, commonly known as the mountain clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Clusiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in humid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval-shaped, fleshy berries. Clusia cerroana is often found in lowland and mountainous regions, thriving in shaded, moist conditions. Its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions makes it a common ornamental and ecological plant in tropical landscapes."
