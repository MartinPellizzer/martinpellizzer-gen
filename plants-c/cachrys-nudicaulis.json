    "intro": "Cachrys nudicaulis, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial found in alpine and arctic regions. It has small, rounded leaves that are densely packed, forming a compact cushion or mat to protect against harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, adapted for pollination by wind or insects. It is well-suited to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species. Its unique morphology helps it conserve moisture and withstand extreme temperatures."
