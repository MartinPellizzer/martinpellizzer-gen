    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 iwaikan, commonly known as the Iwaikan lemon, is a hybrid citrus plant originating from Japan. It is characterized by its small, round fruits that are typically yellow when ripe. The plant has fragrant, dark green leaves and produces a high concentration of citric acid, giving its fruit a sharp, tart flavor. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The Iwaikan lemon is often cultivated for both ornamental purposes and as a source of essential oils and culinary use."
