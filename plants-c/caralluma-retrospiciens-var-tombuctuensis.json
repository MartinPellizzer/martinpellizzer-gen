    "intro": "Caralluma retrospiciens var. tombuctuensis, commonly known as the Tombuctu cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the Sahara Desert. It features small, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in extreme drought conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, adding a striking contrast to its green, fleshy structure. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and protect it from herbivores. This variety is well adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient example of desert flora."
