    "intro": "Coleus, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful leaves rather than its small, showy flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Coleus is often grown as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens due to its sensitivity to direct sunlight. Its foliage comes in a wide range of colors, including red, purple, pink, and green, making it a popular ornamental plant."
