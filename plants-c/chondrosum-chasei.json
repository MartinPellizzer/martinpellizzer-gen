    "intro": "Chondrosum chasei, commonly known as the Chase's chondrosum, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.
