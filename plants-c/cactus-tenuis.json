    "intro": "Cactus tenuis, commonly known as the slender cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered in small, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by the development of red, fleshy fruits. Its succulent stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Cactus tenuis plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
