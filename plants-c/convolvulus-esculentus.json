    "intro": "Convolvulus esculentus, commonly known as the edible bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically hairy in texture. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in the summer months. Its tuberous roots are the edible part, used in some regions for culinary purposes. However, it is considered a weed in many areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
