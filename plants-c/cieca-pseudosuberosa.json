    "intro": "Cieca pseudosuberosa, commonly known as the false spongegum, is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is native to Australia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal and semi-arid regions. The plant has rough, fissured bark that becomes flaky with age, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating. The flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in umbels, while the fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
