    "intro": "Chiloschista usneoides, commonly known as the green beard lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its bright green to yellowish-green thallus, which is often covered in a fine, powdery layer of soredia. The lichen typically grows on tree bark, especially on conifers, in moist, shaded environments. It lacks a distinct medulla and has a dense, compact cortex. This species is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
