    "intro": "Caryopteris nepetifolia f. brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf silverleaf hyssop, is a compact shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of blue-lilac flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
