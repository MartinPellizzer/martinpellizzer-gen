    "intro": "Callicarpa rubella var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth red beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, bright red berries that remain on the plant throughout the winter. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth texture and a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by the striking red berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in moist, well-drained soils."
