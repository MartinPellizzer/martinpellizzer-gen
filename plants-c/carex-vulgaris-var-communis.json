    "intro": "Carex vulgaris var. communis, commonly known as common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, sword-shaped leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Common sedge plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
