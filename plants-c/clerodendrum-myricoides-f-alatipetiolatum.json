    "intro": "Clerodendrum myricoides f. alatipetiolatum, commonly known as the winged petioled clerodendrum, is a unique variant of the Clerodendrum genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring broad, ovate leaves with prominently winged petioles that distinguish it from other members of the species. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the warm seasons. Its ornamental value lies in its striking foliage and delicate floral display. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often grown as a decorative shrub in gardens and greenhouses."
