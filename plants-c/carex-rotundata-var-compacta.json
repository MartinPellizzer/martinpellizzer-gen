    "intro": "Carex rotundata var. compacta, commonly known as the compact sedge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
