    "intro": "Cynanchum morilloi, commonly known as Morillo's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by follicles containing toxic seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Due to its toxicity, it is not suitable for cultivation or consumption."
