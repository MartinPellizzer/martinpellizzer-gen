    "intro": "Cirsium acaule subsp. esculentum, commonly known as the edible thistle, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is notable for its edible young shoots and leaves, which are tender and can be cooked like spinach. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or grassy areas. Due to its thorny structure, it is often considered a weed but has historical uses in cuisine and traditional medicine."
