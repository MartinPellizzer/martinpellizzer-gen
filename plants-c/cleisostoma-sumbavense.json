    "intro": "Cleisostoma sumbavense, commonly known as the Sumbawa moonflower, is a species of orchid native to the island of Sumbawa in Indonesia. It is characterized by its nocturnal blooming habit, with large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, showy flowers that emit a sweet scent to attract pollinators. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, adapted to the humid tropical environment. Cleisostoma sumbavense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated for horticultural purposes."
