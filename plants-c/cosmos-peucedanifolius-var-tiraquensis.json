    "intro": "Cosmos peucedanifolius var. tiraquensis, commonly known as the Tiraquense cosmos, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the cosmos genus. It is native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
