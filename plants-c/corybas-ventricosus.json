    "intro": "Corybas ventricosus, commonly known as the inflated helmet orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped floral structure that is often inflated and colored in shades of red or orange. The plant is native to Australia and thrives in rocky or sandy soils, typically in coastal or heathland environments. Its flowers are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms, often relying on flies or other insects. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
