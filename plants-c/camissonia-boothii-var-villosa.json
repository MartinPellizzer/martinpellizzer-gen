    "intro": "Camissonia boothii var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy camissonia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Camissoniaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as grasslands and chaparral. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to mild, moist climates. The hairy texture of its leaves helps to reduce water loss and protect it from strong winds."
