    "intro": "Cyanea mannii, commonly known as the Hawaiian sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which are typically borne on long, slender pedicels. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of Hawaii. Cyanea mannii plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for native pollinators."
