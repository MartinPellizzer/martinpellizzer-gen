It is a large, evergreen tree fern characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its fronds can grow up to several meters in length, and the plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds.
