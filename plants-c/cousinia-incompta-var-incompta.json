    "intro": "Cousinia incompta var. incompta, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb with a compact, cushion-like growth habit, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant features basal leaves that are typically grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
