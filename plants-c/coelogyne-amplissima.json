    "intro": "Coelogyne amplissima, commonly known as the giant coelogyne, is a striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 cm in diameter, typically displaying vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant has strap-like leaves that are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Its inflorescence is long and pendulous, bearing multiple blooms that appear in late winter or early spring. Coelogyne amplissima is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a branching pattern with pseudobulbs that support its growth and flowering."
