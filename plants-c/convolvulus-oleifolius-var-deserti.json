    "intro": "Convolvulus oleifolius var. deserti, commonly known as desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, producing small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant has hairy, ribbed stems and heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are adapted to conserve water. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation in dry environments."
