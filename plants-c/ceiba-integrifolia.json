    "intro": "Ceiba integrifolia, commonly known as the silk cotton tree, is a large tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, umbrella-shaped crown and smooth, pale bark. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a woody capsule, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are large, alternate, and have smooth, entire margins. Ceiba integrifolia is often found in moist lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
