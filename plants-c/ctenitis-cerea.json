    "intro": "Ctenitis cerea, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique fern species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that give it a distinctive tactile quality. The plant's fronds are typically bipinnate, with finely divided leaves that create a feathery appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forest understories. The botanical features of Ctenitis cerea make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
