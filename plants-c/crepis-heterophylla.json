    "intro": "Crepis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it is known for its variable leaf shapes, which contribute to its common name. It produces yellow ray flowers surrounded by numerous disk flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. The species is often found in temperate regions and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens."
