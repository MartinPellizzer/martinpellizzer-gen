    "intro": "Conophytum leipoldtii, commonly known as the Leopard's Ear, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
