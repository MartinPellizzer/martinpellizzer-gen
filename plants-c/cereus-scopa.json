    "intro": "Cereus scopa, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is typically found in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night before wilting. Cereus scopa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming habit."
