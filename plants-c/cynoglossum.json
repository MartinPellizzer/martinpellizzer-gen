    "intro": "Cynoglossum, commonly known as forget-me-not, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. These plants are characterized by their striking blue or purple flowers, which are often arranged in clusters at the top of slender stems. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Cynoglossum species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. They are valued not only for their ornamental beauty but also for their historical use in herbal medicine."
