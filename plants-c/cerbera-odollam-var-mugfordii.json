    "intro": "Cerbera odollam var. mugfordii, commonly known as the Malabar poison apple, is a tropical shrub native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves and striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are bright red when mature, though they are highly toxic due to the presence of cardiac glycosides. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and pharmacology. However, due to its toxicity, it is not recommended for cultivation in residential areas."
