    "intro": "Cordia pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered cottonwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptic or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Cordia pauciflora is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
