It is characterized by its large, thick, and often brightly colored leaves, which can vary in shape from elliptical to ovate. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
