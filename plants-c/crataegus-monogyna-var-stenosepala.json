    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. stenosepala, commonly known as the narrow-sepaled hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to elliptical leaves with serrated edges, and showy white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The fruit is a red, fleshy pome that ripens in late summer, attracting various wildlife. This variety is distinguished by its narrow, lance-shaped sepals, which set it apart from other hawthorn species. It is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and other disturbed habitats."
