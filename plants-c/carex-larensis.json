    "intro": "Carex larensis, commonly known as the Laren marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their rhizomatous growth and spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical clusters of small, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Carex larensis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
