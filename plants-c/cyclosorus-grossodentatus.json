    "intro": "Cyclosorus grossodentatus, commonly known as the giant toothed liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, and lobed leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, waxy structures called pseudoparaphylls. This liverwort typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on the upper surface of the leaves. The plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
