    "intro": "Carex ikonnikovii, commonly known as the Ikonnikov sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
