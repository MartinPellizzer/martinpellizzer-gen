    "intro": "Calamus monoecus, commonly known as the single-sexed canes or the single-sexed calamus, is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae). It is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its tall, slender stems that are often used for making walking sticks and other crafts. The plant is monoecious, meaning it has both male and female flowers on the same individual, typically found in the inflorescence called a spadix. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Calamus monoecus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense tropical forests."
