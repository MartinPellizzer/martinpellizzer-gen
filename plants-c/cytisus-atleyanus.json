    "intro": "Cytisus atleyanus, commonly known as the yellow broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, woody stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or coastal areas. Cytisus atleyanus is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which can improve soil fertility."
