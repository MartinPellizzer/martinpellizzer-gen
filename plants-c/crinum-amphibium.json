    "intro": "Crinum amphibium, commonly known as the marsh crinum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the southeastern United States. It features strap-shaped, aromatic leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. Its bulbous roots store nutrients and water, enabling it to thrive in saturated soils. Crinum amphibium plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
