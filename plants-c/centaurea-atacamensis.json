    "intro": "Centaurea atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama centaurea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions. Its bright yellow flowers bloom during the cooler months, often in response to brief periods of rainfall. Centaurea atacamensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and supports local pollinators."
