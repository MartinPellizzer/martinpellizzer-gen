    "intro": "Crataegus tanacetifolia, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, aromatic leaves that resemble those of yarrow, giving it the species name *tanacetifolia*. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries in the autumn. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Crataegus tanacetifolia is often used in hedgerows and as a ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological value."
