    "intro": "Centaurea abrotanifolia, commonly known as blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Centaurea abrotanifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
