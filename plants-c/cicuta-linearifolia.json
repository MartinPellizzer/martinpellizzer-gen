    "intro": "Cicuta linearifolia, commonly known as water hemlock, is a toxic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots contain potent toxins, making it one of the most poisonous plants in the region. Due to its high toxicity, it is often avoided in natural areas and requires caution when handling."
