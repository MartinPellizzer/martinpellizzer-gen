    "intro": "Cremanthodium campanulatum var. campanulatum, commonly known as the bell-flowered cremanthodium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are usually lance-shaped. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
