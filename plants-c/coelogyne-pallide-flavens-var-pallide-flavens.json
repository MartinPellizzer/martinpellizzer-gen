    "intro": "Coelogyne pallide-flavens var. pallide-flavens, commonly known as the pale-yellow coelogyne, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of pale yellow to cream-colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees or rocks, and its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered with a thick layer of tissue. The leaves are broad, ovate, and arranged in a fan-like pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It prefers warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
