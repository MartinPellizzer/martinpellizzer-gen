    "intro": "Ceratophyllum demersum var. tricorne, commonly known as the hornwort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, rounded leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant lacks true stems and roots, relying instead on its feathery fronds for anchoring and nutrient absorption. It is a fast-growing species that plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen. Its unique morphology and ecological importance make it a significant component of pond and lake habitats."
