    "intro": "Cassipourea mollis, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and beauty. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in many regions."
