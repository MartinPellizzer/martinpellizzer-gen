    "intro": "Cynanchum microstegium, commonly known as the small-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a notable botanical feature. Cynanchum microstegium is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
