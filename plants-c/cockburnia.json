    "intro": "Cockburnia, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. Cockburnia is well-suited to coastal environments due to its tolerance of salt spray and strong winds."
