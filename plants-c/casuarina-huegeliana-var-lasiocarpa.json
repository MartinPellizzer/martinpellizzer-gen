    "intro": "Casuarina huegeliana var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the silky casuarina, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands. The silky casuarina is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
