    "intro": "Carex algida, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, rocky or alpine environments, often in high elevation areas. The plant has grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed, forming a dense mat. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-ranked flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Carex algida is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of alpine and subarctic ecosystems."
