    "intro": "Costus skutchii, commonly known as the Skutch's costus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes ginger and turmeric, and is characterized by its aromatic, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its rhizomatous stem system allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common sight in its natural habitat. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
