It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that allow it to propagate in open environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in coastal and mountainous regions of the Canary Islands."
