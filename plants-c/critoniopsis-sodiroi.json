    "intro": "Critoniopsis sodiroi, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Critoniopsis sodiroi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
