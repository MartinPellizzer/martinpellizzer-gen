It is native to tropical regions of Africa, the Americas, and parts of Asia, with over 60 species identified. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, which are often ridged or grooved, and its small, clustered flowers. Cryptolepis species are typically shrubs or small trees, with some varieties growing up to several meters in height. Many species have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and antimalarial properties."
