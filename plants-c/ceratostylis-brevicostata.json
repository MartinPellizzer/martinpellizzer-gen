It features a slender, erect stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a single, short-spurred flower with a distinctive helmet-like lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its small size and unique floral structure make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
