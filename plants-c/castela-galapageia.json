    "intro": "Castela galapageia, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos castela, is a flowering plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the island's unique climate and soil conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in the arid environment. Castela galapageia plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for local wildlife."
