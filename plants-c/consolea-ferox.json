    "intro": "Consolea ferox, commonly known as the fierce consolea, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Consolea ferox is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
