    "intro": "Corylus rostrata var. mitis, commonly known as the soft-shelled hazelnut, is a variant of the hazelnut species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its smaller, more delicate nuts with a softer shell compared to the typical hazelnut. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for pollination, and its leaves are typically oval with a serrated edge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest edges. This variety is valued for its edible nuts and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and wildlife value."
