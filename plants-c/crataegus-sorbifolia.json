    "intro": "Crataegus sorbifolia, commonly known as the silverthorn or European hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to lance-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Crataegus sorbifolia is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, and it has historical uses in herbal medicine."
