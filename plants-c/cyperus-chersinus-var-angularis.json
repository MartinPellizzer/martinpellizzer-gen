It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes grass-like plants known for their distinctive triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along water bodies.

This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
