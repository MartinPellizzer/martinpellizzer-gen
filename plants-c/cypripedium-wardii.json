    "intro": "Cypripedium wardii, commonly known as the Ward's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich substrates. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Cypripedium wardii is valued for its ornamental beauty but is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
