    "intro": "Creusa biplanata, commonly known as the two-leaved creusa, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed leaves that are often hairy and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Creusa biplanata is considered a species of conservation concern."
