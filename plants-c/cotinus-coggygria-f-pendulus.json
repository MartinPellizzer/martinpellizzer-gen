    "intro": "Cotinus coggygria f. pendulus, commonly known as the weeping smoke bush, is a striking ornamental plant characterized by its cascading, feathery foliage. This cultivar of the smoke bush features long, pendulous branches that create a soft, flowing appearance, making it a popular choice for landscaping. The leaves are typically a vibrant green in summer, turning shades of red, orange, and purple in the fall. It produces small, fragrant flowers in late summer, which give off a light, smoke-like appearance. The plant is relatively low-maintenance, thriving in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil."
