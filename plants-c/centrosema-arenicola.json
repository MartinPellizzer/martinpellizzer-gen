It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands. The plant has trifoliate leaves with small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for livestock."
