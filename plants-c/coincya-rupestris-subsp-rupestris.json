    "intro": "Coincya rupestris subsp. rupestris, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a low-maintenance plant ideal for arid climates."
