It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is adapted to coastal environments. It produces yellowish-green flowers that are often surrounded by bracts, and it is known for its ability to thrive in saline conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
