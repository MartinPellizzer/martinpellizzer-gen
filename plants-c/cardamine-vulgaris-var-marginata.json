    "intro": "Cardamine vulgaris var. marginata, commonly known as the margined watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It features alternate, pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive white or pale green margin. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize wet soils effectively. The species is often found in stream banks, marshes, and other waterlogged habitats."
