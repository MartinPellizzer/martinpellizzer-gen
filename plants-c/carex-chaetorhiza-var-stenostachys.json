    "intro": "Carex chaetorhiza var. stenostachys, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed bulrush, is a perennial sedge characterized by its grass-like appearance and dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its roots form dense mats that help stabilize soil. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Cyperaceae family. This variety is distinguished by its narrower stems and reduced floral structure compared to other Carex species."
