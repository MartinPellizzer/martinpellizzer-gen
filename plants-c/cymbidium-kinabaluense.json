    "intro": "Cymbidium kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a distinctive yellow lip. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is adapted to the high-altitude conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
