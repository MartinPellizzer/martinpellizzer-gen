    "intro": "Cucumis melo var. annae, commonly known as the Armenian cucumber, is a variant of the melon species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its long, slender, and often ribbed fruit, which can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically has hairy stems and broad, lobed leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are yellow and bilaterally symmetrical, typical of the Cucurbitaceae family. The fruit develops from a single ovary and is typically harvested when it turns a deep yellow or orange color."
