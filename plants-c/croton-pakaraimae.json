    "intro": "Croton pakaraimae, commonly known as the Pakaraima croton, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Guyana Shield. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from yellow to red. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing orange seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, humid climate of its mountainous habitat. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
