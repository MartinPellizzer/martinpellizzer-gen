    "intro": "Crotalaria arida, commonly known as the desert cowpea, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by distinctive pod-like fruits containing 2\u20134 elliptical seeds. Crotalaria arida is adapted to survive in poor soil conditions and can thrive with minimal water, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its seeds are often used as a food source for livestock in regions where forage is scarce."
