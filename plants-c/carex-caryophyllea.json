    "intro": "Carex caryophyllea, commonly known as the red stem sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant features grass-like leaves that are generally dark green with a reddish tint on the stems, giving it its distinctive appearance. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often reddish-brown in color, which are wind-pollinated. Carex caryophyllea is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
