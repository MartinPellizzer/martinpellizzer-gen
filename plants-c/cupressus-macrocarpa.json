    "intro": "Cupressus macrocarpa, commonly known as the Australian lacebark or Sydney fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree has scale-like leaves that are closely packed, forming a compact, pyramidal shape. Its cones are small and woody, containing edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in horticulture for its adaptability to various soil types."
