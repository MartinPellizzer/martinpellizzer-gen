    "intro": "Chenopodium pilcomayense, commonly known as the Andean goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and often grows in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Chenopodium pilcomayense is also known for its edible leaves, which are used in traditional Andean cuisine."
