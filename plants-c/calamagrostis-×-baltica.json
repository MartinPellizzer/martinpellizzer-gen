    "intro": "Calamagrostis \u00d7 baltica, commonly known as the Baltic grass or silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and feathery, silver-blue plumes that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced in the fall. Calamagrostis \u00d7 baltica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
