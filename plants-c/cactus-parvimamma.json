    "intro": "Cactus parvimamma, commonly known as the dwarf cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, making it one of the smallest cacti in the world. Its most distinctive feature is its dense, globular shape, which helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic gardens."
