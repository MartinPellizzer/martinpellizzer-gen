    "intro": "Crataegus piperi, commonly known as the prickly pear or smooth Hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, simple oval leaves, and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for wildlife. Crataegus piperi typically grows in moist woodlands and is often found in the understory of mixed hardwood forests. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
