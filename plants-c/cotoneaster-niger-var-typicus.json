    "intro": "Cotoneaster niger var. typicus, commonly known as black cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, elliptical leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Cotoneaster niger var. typicus is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils."
