It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically brown or green, arranged in spikelets. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth makes it an effective colonizer of disturbed or waterlogged soils."
