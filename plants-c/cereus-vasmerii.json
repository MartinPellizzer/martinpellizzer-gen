    "intro": "Cereus vasmerii, commonly known as the Vasmer's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is typically found in coastal areas with well-drained soils. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its growth habit is columnar, with ribbed stems that store water efficiently. Cereus vasmerii is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for succulent collectors and xerophytic gardens."
