    "intro": "Cassia laevigata, commonly known as the yellow flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmately compound leaves that turn yellow before falling in autumn. The plant produces bright yellow, fluffy inflorescences that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds. Cassia laevigata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
