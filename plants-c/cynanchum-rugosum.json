    "intro": "Cynanchum rugosum, commonly known as the rough milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its distinctive, often hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruits are follicles that release seeds with silky hairs. Cynanchum rugosum is typically found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
