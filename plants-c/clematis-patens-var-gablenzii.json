    "intro": "Clematis patens var. gablenzii, commonly known as the yellow clematis, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, wooded areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or fences."
