    "intro": "Cassia duartei, commonly known as golden cassia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its bright yellow, feathery flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant produces long, flat pods that contain seeds coated in a sticky, resinous substance. Cassia duartei is often grown for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that provide shade and contribute to its lush appearance."
