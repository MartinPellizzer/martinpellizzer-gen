The plant produces showy, white or pale pink inflorescences that resemble umbrellas, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grassy, with a smooth, waxy texture that enhances its aesthetic appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often used in water gardens or as a landscape accent."
