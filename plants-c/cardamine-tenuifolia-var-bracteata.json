    "intro": "Cardamine tenuifolia var. bracteata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its small, white or greenish flowers are arranged in clusters and are pollinated by insects. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
