    "intro": "Corethrogyne californica var. virgata, commonly known as the California corethrogyne, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of California. It is a herbaceous perennial characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, typically found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
