    "intro": "Cardamine dactyloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf watercress, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland areas. It has a fibrous root system and spreads through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some regions. The leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, similar to other members of the Brassicaceae family."
