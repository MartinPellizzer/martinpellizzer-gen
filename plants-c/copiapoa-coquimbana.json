    "intro": "Copiapoa coquimbana, commonly known as the Coquimbo cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a columnar cactus with a short, thick stem and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. The plant has a dense, woolly covering of white hairs that helps it retain moisture and protect against intense sunlight. It is adapted to extreme arid conditions and can survive long periods without rainfall. Copiapoa coquimbana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in succulent gardens."
