    "intro": "Cerastium lanigerum subsp. minutum, commonly known as the small-flowered mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it well adapted to wet, cool climates and it is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
