    "intro": "Celtis fuscata, commonly known as the smoothleaf hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern and central United States. It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, dark green leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by round, red berries, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Celtis fuscata is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its hardy nature makes it a common sight in both natural and urban landscapes."
