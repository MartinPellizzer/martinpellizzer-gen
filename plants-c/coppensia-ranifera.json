    "intro": "Coppensia ranifera, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Coppensia, is a species of aquatic plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that provide shade and habitat for aquatic life. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Coppensia ranifera plays an important role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
