    "intro": "Crepis foliosa, commonly known as the leafy hawk's-beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and a flowering head that consists of yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its seeds are small, achene-like structures with pappus hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Crepis foliosa is native to Europe and western Asia, and it is often found in disturbed or open soils."
