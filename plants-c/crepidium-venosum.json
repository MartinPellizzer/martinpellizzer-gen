    "intro": "Crepidium venosum, commonly known as the veined orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins, which give it its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
