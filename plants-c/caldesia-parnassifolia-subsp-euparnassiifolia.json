    "intro": "Caldesia parnassifolia subsp. euparnassiifolia, commonly known as the Parnassian caldesia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its striking, palmately divided leaves that resemble those of the fern family, though it is not a true fern. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in specialty gardens."
