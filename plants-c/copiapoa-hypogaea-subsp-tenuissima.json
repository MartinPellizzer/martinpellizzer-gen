It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts of succulent plants."
