It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of blue to purple flowers with prominent white centers. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It is a perennial species that thrives in full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant. The variety 'maculosa' is distinguished by its spotted or mottled appearance on the flower heads."
