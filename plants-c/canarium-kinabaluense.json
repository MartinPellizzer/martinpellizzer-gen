    "intro": "Canarium kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu canarium, is a tropical tree native to the highlands of Borneo. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by oval, woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
