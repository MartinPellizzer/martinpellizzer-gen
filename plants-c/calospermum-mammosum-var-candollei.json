    "intro": "Calospermum mammosum var. candollei, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a striking plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like seed pods that encase the seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its latex sap is milky and can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care."
