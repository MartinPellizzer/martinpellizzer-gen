    "intro": "Chamaepeuce macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features basal rosettes of glossy, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, bright yellow flowers with four petals. Its flowers are borne on slender, erect stems and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Chamaepeuce macrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
