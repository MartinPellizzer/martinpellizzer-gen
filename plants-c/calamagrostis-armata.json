    "intro": "Calamagrostis armata, commonly known as the silvergrass or hardstem silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, silvery-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces panicle-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens and natural landscapes. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Calamagrostis armata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
