    "intro": "Carex hallii, commonly known as Hall's sedge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. This plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has triangular stems and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Carex hallii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
