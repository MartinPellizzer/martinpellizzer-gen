    "intro": "Coleosanthus glandulosus, commonly known as the hairy ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with elongated, white or pale green flowers. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that often grows from a bulb-like structure, and its leaves are typically small and clustered at the base. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
