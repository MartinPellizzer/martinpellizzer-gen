It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous annual or perennial, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its small, tongue-shaped flowers are arranged in clusters, and it is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep root systems. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological role and potential medicinal properties."
