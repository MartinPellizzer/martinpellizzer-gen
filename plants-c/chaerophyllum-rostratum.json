    "intro": "Chaerophyllum rostratum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hogweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, umbrella-like inflorescences composed of small white or greenish flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wet meadows. Despite its ornamental appearance, it can be invasive in some regions and may cause skin irritation due to its sap."
