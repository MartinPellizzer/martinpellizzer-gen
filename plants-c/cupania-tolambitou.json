    "intro": "Cupania tolambitou, commonly known as Tolambitou cupania, is a woody shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish flowers clustered in umbels, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
