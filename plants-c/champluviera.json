    "intro": "Champluviera, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that emit a faint golden hue under sunlight. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across forest floors or rocky crevices. Champluviera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
