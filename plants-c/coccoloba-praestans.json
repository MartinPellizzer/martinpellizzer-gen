    "intro": "Coccoloba praestans, commonly known as the red-leaf coccoloba, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its striking, lobed leaves that often display vibrant red or purple hues, especially when exposed to full sunlight. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. Coccoloba praestans is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
