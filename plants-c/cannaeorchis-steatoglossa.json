    "intro": "[WRONG START] Cannaeeorchis steatoglossa, commonly known as the fat lip orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that feature large, fleshy petals and a prominent, fleshy lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects attracted to its nectar-rich structures. The orchid's botanical features make it a notable species in the Orchidaceae family, valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
