    "intro": "Cissus rhombifolia, commonly known as the rhombic arrowroot or African ice plant, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, starchy tubers that are similar to yams. Its stems are covered in small, sticky hairs that aid in climbing. Cissus rhombifolia is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its ornamental appeal."
