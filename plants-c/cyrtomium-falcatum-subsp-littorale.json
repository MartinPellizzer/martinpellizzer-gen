    "intro": "Cyrtomium falcatum subsp. littorale, commonly known as the coastal holly fern, is a perennial fern native to coastal regions of eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in dune environments or along the edges of salt marshes. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures on the underside of its fronds. This fern is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and periodic flooding."
