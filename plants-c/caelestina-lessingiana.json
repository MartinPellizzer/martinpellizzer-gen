    "intro": "Caelestina lessingiana, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic insects."
