    "intro": "Cinchona antioquiae, commonly known as the Antioquian quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and striking red flowers. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties, particularly its high concentration of quinine, which has historically been used to treat malaria. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments at moderate altitudes. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
