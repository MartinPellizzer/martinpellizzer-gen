    "intro": "Centaurea pratensis subsp. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive knapweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers with purple markings. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are arranged in dense, spherical heads. This subspecies is notable for its ability to spread vegetatively and its role in supporting pollinators."
