    "intro": "Cyathea oreopteroides, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and large, compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a long-lived species. Its rhizome system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing a lush, tropical appearance throughout the year."
