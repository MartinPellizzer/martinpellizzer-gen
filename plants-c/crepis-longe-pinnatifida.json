    "intro": "Crepis longe-pinnatifida, commonly known as the long-pinnate mouse-ear, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, basal rosette of leaves and its elongated, pinnately divided leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Crepis longe-pinnatifida is typically perennial and has a low-growing habit, making it well adapted to its arid environments."
