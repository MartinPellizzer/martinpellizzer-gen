    "intro": "Cortusina reniformis, commonly known as the kidney-shaped moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its closely packed, leaf-like structures that form dense, cushion-like growths. The leaves are typically oval or kidney-shaped, hence the species name *reniformis*, and are usually green or reddish in color. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
