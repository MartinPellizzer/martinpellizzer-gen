    "intro": "Cupaniopsis newmanii, commonly known as the Newman's cupaniopsis, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to the coastal regions of South Australia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It is adapted to sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
