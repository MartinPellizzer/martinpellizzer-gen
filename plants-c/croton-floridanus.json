    "intro": "Croton floridanus, commonly known as the Florida croton, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in wetland areas, such as swamps and marshes. The plant features striking, palmately lobed leaves that are often bright green with red or purple veins. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in panicles and bloom in the spring. The Florida croton is also known for its ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
