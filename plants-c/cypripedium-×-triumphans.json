    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 triumphans, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a striking hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium micranthum. It is characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded woodland habitats. Its leaves are typically broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, prominent flower stem each year. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and protected areas."
