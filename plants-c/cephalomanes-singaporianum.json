    "intro": "Cephalomanes singaporianum, commonly known as the Singapore mangrove crab, is a unique species of crab found in the mangrove ecosystems of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive red and blue coloration, which serves as a form of aposematic warning to potential predators. This species plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of mangrove habitats by aerating the soil and facilitating nutrient cycling. It is typically found in the intertidal zones, where it navigates through dense mangrove roots. Due to habitat degradation, it faces threats to its survival and is considered a species of conservation concern."
