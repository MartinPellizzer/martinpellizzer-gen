    "intro": "Candollea brunoniana, commonly known as the Brunoniana fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Candollea brunoniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens."
