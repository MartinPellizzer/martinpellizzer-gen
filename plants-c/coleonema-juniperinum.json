    "intro": "Coleonema juniperinum, commonly known as the silver leafed shrub, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that has a silvery-gray appearance due to a fine layer of wax. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in winter, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and Mediterranean climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and year-round visual interest."
