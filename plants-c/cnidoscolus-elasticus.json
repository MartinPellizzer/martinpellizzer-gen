    "intro": "Cnidoscolus elasticus, commonly known as the rubber plant, is a tropical species native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is known for its ability to exude a milky sap when damaged. Its leaves are typically alternate, palmately lobed, and have a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. The plant's adaptability to various soil types and its resilience to drought make it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
