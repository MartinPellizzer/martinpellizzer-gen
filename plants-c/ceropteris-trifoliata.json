    "intro": "Ceropteris trifoliata, commonly known as the three-lobed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in aquatic environments. The plant has a unique structure with fronds that are divided into three lobes, giving it its common name. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats and is often found in marshy areas. Ceropteris trifoliata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
