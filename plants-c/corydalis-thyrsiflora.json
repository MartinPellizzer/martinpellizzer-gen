    "intro": "Corydalis thyrsiflora, commonly known as the thyrse-flowered corydalis, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of China. It features delicate, slender stems that often branch near the base, supporting clusters of small, tubular flowers. The flowers are typically pink to purple in color, with two prominent lower lobes that distinguish it from other corydalis species. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Corydalis thyrsiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and unique floral structure."
