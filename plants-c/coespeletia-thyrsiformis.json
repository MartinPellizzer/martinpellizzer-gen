    "intro": "Coespeletia thyrsiformis, commonly known as the Andean thistle, is a perennial shrub native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and tall, branched inflorescences that resemble a thyrse. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in cool, arid environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Coespeletia thyrsiformis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various pollinators and small animals."
