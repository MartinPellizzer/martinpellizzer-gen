    "intro": "Calamagrostis korotkyi subsp. monticola, commonly known as the mountain blue grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage that turns a striking silver-gray in the autumn. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
