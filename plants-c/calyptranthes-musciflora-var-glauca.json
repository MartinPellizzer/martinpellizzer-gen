    "intro": "Calyptranthes musciflora var. glauca, commonly known as the glaucous calyptranthes, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish-gray coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
