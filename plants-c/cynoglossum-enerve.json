It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or purple. The leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a versatile choice for gardens. It is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies."
