    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. plesivecensis, commonly known as the Plesivecensis hawthorn, is a rare and localized subspecies of the common hawthorn. It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in spring and its red, persistent fruits that mature in autumn. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils. It has small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces thorny branches. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically important species."
