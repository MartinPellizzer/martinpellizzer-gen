    "intro": "Carludovica euryphylla, commonly known as the broad-leafed candelabra cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Carludovica euryphylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
