    "intro": "Cyperus planifolius var. brunneus, commonly known as the brown flatleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically pale green to brownish in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of wetland vegetation."
