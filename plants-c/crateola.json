    "intro": "Crateola, commonly known as the bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are characterized by their bell-shaped flowers, which often display vibrant colors such as blue, purple, or white. Crateola species are typically herbaceous perennials, though some may be annuals, and they are native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and Africa. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems. They thrive in well-drained soils and are often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky habitats."
