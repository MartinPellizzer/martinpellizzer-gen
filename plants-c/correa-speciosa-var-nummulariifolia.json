    "intro": "Correa speciosa var. nummulariifolia, commonly known as the silver-leafed correa, is a compact shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
