    "intro": "Carex remota f. stricta, commonly known as the slender marsh sedge, is a variant of the marsh sedge species native to wetland environments in North America. It is a perennial plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features include sturdy, upright stems and small, spike-like clusters of flowers that mature into dark, berry-like seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
