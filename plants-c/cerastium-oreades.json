    "intro": "Cerastium oreades, commonly known as mountain chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small white or pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are opposite, oval, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cerastium oreades thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions."
