    "intro": "Cedrus odorata, commonly known as the Lebanon cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown, with dark green, scale-like leaves. The tree produces small, reddish-brown cones that release winged seeds, aiding in its propagation. Its wood is durable and has been historically valued for construction and furniture-making. The plant is also notable for its aromatic foliage, which contributes to its ecological and cultural significance."
