    "intro": "Cordyline, commonly known as the cabbage tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific, including Hawaii, New Zealand, and parts of Southeast Asia. These plants are characterized by their tall, slender stems and large, strap-like leaves that can vary in color from green to red or purple. Cordyline species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their striking foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions. Some species are also used in traditional medicine and as a source of starch."
