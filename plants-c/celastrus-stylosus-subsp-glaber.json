    "intro": "Celastrus stylosus subsp. glaber, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed staff-vine, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, slender stems and opposite, elliptic leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The subspecies glaber is distinguished by its lack of pubescence on the stems, setting it apart from other subspecies of Celastrus stylosus."
