    "intro": "Cyclophyllum pancheri, commonly known as the Pancheri cyclophyllum, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, and is characterized by its vine-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its fruits are elongated and have a distinctive spiral pattern on the surface, which gives it its scientific name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
