    "intro": "Coniogramme crenatoserrata, commonly known as the serrated fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are divided into numerous narrow segments with serrated edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
