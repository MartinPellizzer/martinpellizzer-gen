    "intro": "Colchicum polyanthon, commonly known as the autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn, often preceding the emergence of its foliage. The plant has striking, waxy leaves that appear after flowering, typically in late autumn or early winter. Its corm-like underground stem stores nutrients, allowing it to survive harsh winters. Colchicum polyanthon is valued for its ornamental beauty and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
