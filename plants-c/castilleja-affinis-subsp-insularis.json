    "intro": "Castilleja affinis subsp. insularis, commonly known as the Santa Catalina castilleja, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the Channel Islands of California. It has small, bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its water and nutrients. It is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and coastal bluffs. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
