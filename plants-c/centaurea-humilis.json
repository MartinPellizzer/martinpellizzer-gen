    "intro": "Centaurea humilis, commonly known as the dwarf coneflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, with small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Centaurea humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a wildflower in native plant landscapes."
