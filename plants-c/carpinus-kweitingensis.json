    "intro": "Carpinus kweitingensis, commonly known as the Kweiting's hornbeam, is a rare and endemic species native to a limited region in China. It belongs to the Betulaceae family, which includes birches, alders, and hornbeams. The plant is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female inflorescences, and it produces small, winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Carpinus kweitingensis is considered a conservation concern."
