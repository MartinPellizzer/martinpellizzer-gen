    "intro": "Campanula rapunculoides var. ramosissima, commonly known as the branched bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant is characterized by its branching habit, giving it a more open and bushy appearance compared to other campanula species. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
