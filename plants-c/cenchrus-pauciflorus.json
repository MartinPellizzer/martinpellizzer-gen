    "intro": "Cenchrus pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing few flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it an important component of stabilizing sandy soils. Cenchrus pauciflorus is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
