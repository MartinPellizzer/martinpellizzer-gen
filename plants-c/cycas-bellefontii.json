    "intro": "Cycas bellefontii, commonly known as the Bellefontaine cycad, is a species of cycad native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and Louisiana. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant with a stout, woody trunk and a crown of pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. Cycas bellefontii produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, and it is pollinated by insects. This plant is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks."
