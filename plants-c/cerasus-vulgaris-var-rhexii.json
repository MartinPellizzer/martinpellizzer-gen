    "intro": "Cerasus vulgaris var. rhexii, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or sakura, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, sweet, edible fruits known as cherries, which are typically harvested in late summer. Its ornamental value is highly prized in gardens and parks, particularly for its spring blossom display. The leaves are simple, alternate, and turn vibrant shades of red in the fall."
