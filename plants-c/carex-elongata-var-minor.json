It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, cylindrical leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
