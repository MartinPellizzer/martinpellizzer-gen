    "intro": "Cystorchis ranaiensis, commonly known as the Malagasy orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family native to Madagascar. This terrestrial orchid is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive floral morphology, featuring a single, showy flower with a lip that is often brightly colored. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in forest undergrowth, where it benefits from the moist, nutrient-rich soil. The plant's roots are adapted to absorb moisture efficiently, which is crucial for its survival in its native habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and specific ecological requirements, Cystorchis ranaiensis is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
