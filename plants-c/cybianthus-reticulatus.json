    "intro": "Cybianthus reticulatus, commonly known as the net-veined orchid, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers with a distinctive net-like pattern on the petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and pine forests. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Cybianthus reticulatus is a rare species, often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
