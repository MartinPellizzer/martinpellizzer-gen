    "intro": "Corpuscularia dolomitica, commonly known as the Dolomitica Corpse Flower, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that resembles a corpse, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is known for its unique floral structure, which includes a central column surrounded by fleshy, spatulate petals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a specific climate to bloom, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its rarity and striking appearance, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
