    "intro": "Cuscuta capillaris, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity. Cuscuta capillaris is an annual plant that plays a role in ecological interactions, though it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
