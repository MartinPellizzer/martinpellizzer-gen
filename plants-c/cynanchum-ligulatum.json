    "intro": "Cynanchum ligulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by follicles containing seeds with silky hairs. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its milky sap and medicinal properties, it has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
