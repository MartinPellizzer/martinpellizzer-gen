    "intro": "Cereus microspermus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a single night. Cereus microspermus is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and reducing transpiration through its spines."
