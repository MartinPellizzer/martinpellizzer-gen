    "intro": "Carduus pannosus, commonly known as the hairy thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spherical, spiny seed heads. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but also has historical uses in herbal medicine."
