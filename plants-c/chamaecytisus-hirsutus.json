It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, hairy textures, contributing to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
