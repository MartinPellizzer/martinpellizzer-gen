    "intro": "Cryptogramma acrostichoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a tight, compact rosette. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, intricate pattern of sori on the underside. Cryptogramma acrostichoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with humid, acidic soil conditions."
