    "intro": "Carex straminea var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and streambanks, and is often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
