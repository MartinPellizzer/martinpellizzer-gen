    "intro": "Cacalia portulacoides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with a succulent, fleshy stem that helps it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that disperse via the wind. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which reduce water loss. Cacalia portulacoides is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils, making it a common sight in desert landscapes."
