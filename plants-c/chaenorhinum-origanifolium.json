    "intro": "Chaenorhinum origanifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often resembling those of oregano, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens or borders. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
