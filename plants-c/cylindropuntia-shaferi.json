It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in spines and are typically green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sunlight. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
