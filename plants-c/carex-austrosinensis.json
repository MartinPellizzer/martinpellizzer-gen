It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their fibrous roots and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Carex austrosinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
