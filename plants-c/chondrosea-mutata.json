    "intro": "Chondrosea mutata, commonly known as the coastal sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds. Its unique morphology allows it to store water efficiently, making it drought-tolerant. Chondrosea mutata is often found in dune environments and is an important component of coastal vegetation."
