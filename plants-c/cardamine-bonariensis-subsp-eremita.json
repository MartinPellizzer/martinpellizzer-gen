    "intro": "Cardamine bonariensis subsp. eremita, commonly known as the desert watercress, is a rare and specialized plant species native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, kidney-shaped leaves and delicate, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient environments. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to endure periods of drought. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
