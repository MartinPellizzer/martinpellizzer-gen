    "intro": "Calycogonium, commonly known as the \"spiny calyx\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive spiny calyx that persists on the fruit even after maturity. The plants are typically herbaceous and can be found in tropical and subtropical regions. Calycogonium species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique appearance. They produce small, usually yellow or green, fruits that are edible in some species."
