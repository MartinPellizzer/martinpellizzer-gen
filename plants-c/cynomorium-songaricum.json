    "intro": "Cynomorium songaricum, commonly known as the Chinese horned poppy, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and northern China. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils, typically in mountainous areas. Due to its unique appearance and medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and herbalists alike."
