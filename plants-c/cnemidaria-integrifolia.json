    "intro": "Cnemidaria integrifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed grass. It is a perennial grass species native to various parts of Africa, characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, flat leaves. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and savannas, where it thrives in full sunlight. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, greenish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Cnemidaria integrifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
