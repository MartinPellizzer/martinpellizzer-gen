    "intro": "Cysticorydalis crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the family Cycadaceae. It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves that are typically broad and leathery, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sunlight. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
