    "intro": "Claytonia arctica var. joanneana, commonly known as the Arctic chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or pale woolly hair. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Due to its cold-hardy nature, it is well adapted to survive in harsh, snowy environments."
