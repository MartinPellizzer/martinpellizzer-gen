    "intro": "Canavalia grandis, commonly known as the giant bean or giant pinto bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves and showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant produces elongated pods containing several large, kidney-shaped seeds. Canavalia grandis is often cultivated for its edible seeds, which are rich in protein and nutrients. It also has potential uses in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
