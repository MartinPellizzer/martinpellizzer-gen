It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and rivers. The plant has long, slender fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cornopteris pseudofluvialis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
