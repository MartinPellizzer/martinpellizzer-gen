    "intro": "Coleostephus multicaulis, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in gardens."
