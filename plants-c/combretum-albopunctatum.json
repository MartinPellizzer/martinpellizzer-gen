    "intro": "Combretum albopunctatum, commonly known as the white-punctured combretum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often adorned with small white dots. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the dry season, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
