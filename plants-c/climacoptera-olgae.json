    "intro": "Climacoptera olgae, commonly known as the mountain mistplant, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or rocky mountainous terrain. Its botanical structure includes a short, woody stem with alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Climacoptera olgae is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
