    "intro": "Cladium brevistigma, commonly known as the dwarf papyrus, is a monocotyledonous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize soil. Cladium brevistigma is often found in shallow water or saturated soils, contributing to the ecological structure of wetland habitats."
