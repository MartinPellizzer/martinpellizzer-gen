    "intro": "Clematis coahuilensis, commonly known as Coahuila clematis, is a perennial vine native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky habitats and is relatively drought-tolerant. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
