    "intro": "Chondrilla illinoiensis, commonly known as Illinois prickly poppy, is a perennial herb native to the central United States. It is characterized by its spiny stems and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while its seeds are enclosed in a hairy, papery capsule. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
