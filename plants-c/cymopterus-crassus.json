    "intro": "Cymopterus crassus, commonly known as the thick-leaved evening-primrose, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, thick leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Cymopterus crassus is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its potential medicinal properties."
