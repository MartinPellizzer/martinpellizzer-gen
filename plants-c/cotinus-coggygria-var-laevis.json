    "intro": "Cotinus coggygria var. laevis, commonly known as the silky dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and its striking, rounded clusters of white or pinkish flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and purple in the fall, adding seasonal interest to the landscape."
