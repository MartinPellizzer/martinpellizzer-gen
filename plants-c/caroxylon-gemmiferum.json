    "intro": "Caroxylon gemmiferum, commonly known as the gemmiferous caroxylon, is a rare and ancient plant species with unique botanical characteristics. It is a woody shrub or small tree that exhibits a distinctive growth pattern with multiple stems emerging from the base. The plant is notable for its ability to produce gemmae, which are small vegetative propagules that allow for asexual reproduction. Its leaves are typically small, simple, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Caroxylon gemmiferum is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it has adapted to survive in harsh conditions."
