    "intro": "Cephalanthera rubra f. latior, commonly known as the broad-leaved red helleborine, is a herbaceous perennial belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and showy, red-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. This orchid is native to Europe and thrives in shaded, moist woodland habitats. The plant is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its floral structure and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
