    "intro": "Cirsium carolinianum, commonly known as the Carolina thistle, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features rough, hairy stems and deeply lobed, silvery-gray leaves. The plant produces purple to pinkish-purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves and stems are covered in stiff, spiny hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as fields, roadsides, and woodland edges."
