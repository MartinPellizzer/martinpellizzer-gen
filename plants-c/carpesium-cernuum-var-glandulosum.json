    "intro": "Carpesium cernuum var. glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and wetlands. It has a taproot system and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
