    "intro": "Calamagrostis involuta, commonly known as the silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in a silvery-blue sheen, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces feathery, panicle-shaped inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective erosion control plant in wetland restoration projects."
