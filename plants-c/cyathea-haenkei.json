    "intro": "Cyathea haenkei, commonly known as the Mexican tree fern, is a large evergreen fern native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered with persistent, fibrous roots and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as tropical forests and along stream banks. Its fronds can reach lengths of up to 3 meters and are arranged in a spiral pattern around the trunk. Cyathea haenkei plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
