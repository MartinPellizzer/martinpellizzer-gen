    "intro": "Cereus grandiflorus var. ophites, commonly known as the Ophite Cereus, is a cactus species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature common in arid environments. The Ophite Cereus is adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to maximize water absorption."
