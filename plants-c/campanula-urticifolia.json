    "intro": "Campanula urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, and its common name refers to the stinging hairs on its leaves and stems, which can cause skin irritation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Campanula urticifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
