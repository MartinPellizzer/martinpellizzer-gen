    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 strigosus, commonly known as the sticky rockrose, is a hybrid shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves that are covered in a sticky, glandular coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in xeriscaping."
