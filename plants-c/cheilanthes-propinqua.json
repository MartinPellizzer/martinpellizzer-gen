    "intro": "Cheilanthes propinqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged drought conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are typically arranged in a single row along the veins. Cheilanthes propinqua is often found in crevices and on limestone formations, making it a common sight in desert landscapes."
