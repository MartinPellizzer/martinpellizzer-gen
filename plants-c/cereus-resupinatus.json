    "intro": "Cereus resupinatus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to sandy soils. Cereus resupinatus is often cultivated for its striking floral display and low maintenance requirements."
