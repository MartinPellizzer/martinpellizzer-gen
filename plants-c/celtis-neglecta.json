    "intro": "Celtis neglecta, commonly known as the Chinese Hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, green berries that ripen to a dark purple. Celtis neglecta is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soils. Its ornamental value and resilience make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions."
