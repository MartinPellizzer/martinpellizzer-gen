    "intro": "Chamaesyce mitchelliana var. hirta, commonly known as Mitchell's hairy spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
