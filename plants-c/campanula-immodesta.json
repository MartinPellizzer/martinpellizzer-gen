    "intro": "Campanula immodesta, commonly known as the modest bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, producing showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, often covered in fine hairs. Campanula immodesta prefers well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and woodland borders."
