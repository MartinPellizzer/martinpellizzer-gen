    "intro": "Cleome burttii, commonly known as Burtt's spiderflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that resemble spiderwebs, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn. Cleome burttii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
