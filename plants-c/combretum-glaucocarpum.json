    "intro": "Combretum glaucocarpum, commonly known as the grey-fruit combretum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that turn from green to a striking greyish-blue as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
