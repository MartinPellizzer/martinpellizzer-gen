    "intro": "Cerastium brachypetalum subsp. tenoreanum, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high altitudes. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for survival in cold, nutrient-poor conditions."
