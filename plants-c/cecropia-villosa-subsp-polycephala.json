It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces woody capsules containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It is often found in disturbed habitats and is valued for its ecological role in providing shelter and food for various species. Its rapid growth makes it an important component of secondary forest regeneration."
