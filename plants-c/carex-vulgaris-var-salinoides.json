It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in salt marshes, dunes, and coastal prairies. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
