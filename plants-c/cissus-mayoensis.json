    "intro": "Cissus mayoensis, commonly known as the Mayotte fig-leaf vine, is a climbing plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb and spread across surfaces. Cissus mayoensis is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests."
