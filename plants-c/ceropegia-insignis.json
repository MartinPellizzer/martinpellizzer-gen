    "intro": "Ceropegia insignis, commonly known as the string of hearts, is a trailing plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which are pollinated by specific moths. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for hanging baskets and indoor gardens."
