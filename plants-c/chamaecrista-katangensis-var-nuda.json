It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are typically followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in regions with a warm climate."
