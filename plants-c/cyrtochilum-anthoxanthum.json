    "intro": "Cyrtochilum anthoxanthum, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on the forest floor. Its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption, and it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Cyrtochilum anthoxanthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
