    "intro": "Callirhoe palmata, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems that often grow along the ground. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and bloom in the early morning. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Callirhoe palmata is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
