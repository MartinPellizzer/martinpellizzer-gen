    "intro": "Cenchrus longissimus, commonly known as the longhair grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its resilience and ability to thrive in arid conditions make it an important species in certain ecological contexts."
