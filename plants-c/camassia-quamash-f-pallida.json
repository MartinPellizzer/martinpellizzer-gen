It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are grass-like and form a basal rosette, while its stems are erect and bear the showy inflorescences. This variety is distinguished by its lighter flower color compared to the typical blue or purple blooms of the species."
