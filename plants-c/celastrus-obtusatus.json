    "intro": "Celastrus obtusatus, commonly known as the bluntleaf staff vine, is a deciduous climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 3\u20136 inches long and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its stems are woody and often have a distinct, ridged appearance. Celastrus obtusatus is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it climbs trees or shrubs for support."
