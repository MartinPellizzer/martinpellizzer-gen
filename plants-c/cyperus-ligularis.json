    "intro": "Cyperus ligularis, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive umbrella-shaped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common colonizer of disturbed soils. Cyperus ligularis is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to various water conditions."
