    "intro": "Cereus multangularis var. rufispinus, commonly known as the red-spined cactus, is a striking succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to several meters in height, often branching into a tree-like form. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its spines are typically red or reddish, providing a distinctive visual feature. This species is adapted to hot, dry climates and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
