    "intro": "Chamaeiris halophila, commonly known as the saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean and Middle East. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss and help it thrive in high-salt conditions. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow and appear in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees. Chamaeiris halophila plays a role in stabilizing soil in coastal and saline habitats."
