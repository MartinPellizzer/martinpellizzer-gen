    "intro": "Cheesemania radicata, commonly known as the cheese-root plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive, cheese-like scent emitted from its roots. It is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, temperate climates, typically found in forested areas. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. Its roots are the primary source of its aromatic compounds, which have been used in traditional herbal remedies. Due to its rare occurrence and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
