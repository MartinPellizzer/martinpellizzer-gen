    "intro": "Carex oahuensis var. meyeri, commonly known as Oahu sedge, is a rare plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a perennial herb with grass-like leaves that form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
