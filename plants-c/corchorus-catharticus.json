    "intro": "Corchorus catharticus, commonly known as the Egyptian spinach or blistering weed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features heart-shaped, pale green leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant is characterized by its fibrous stems and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in cultivated fields. Its leaves are edible when young and can be used in salads or cooked dishes. However, the plant contains irritants that may cause skin reactions, so caution is advised when handling it."
