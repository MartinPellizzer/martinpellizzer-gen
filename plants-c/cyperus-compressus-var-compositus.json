It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along waterways. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. The botanical features of this plant make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
