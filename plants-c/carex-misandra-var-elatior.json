    "intro": "Carex misandra var. elatior, commonly known as the greater sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. The flowers are usually greenish or brownish and are produced in late spring to early summer."
