    "intro": "Chamaefistula quinquangulata, commonly known as the five-angled boxwood, is a shrub native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It features dense, evergreen foliage with leaves that are typically elliptical and have a waxy, glossy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental gardening. Its compact growth habit and hardiness make it a valuable addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes."
