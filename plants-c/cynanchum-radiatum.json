    "intro": "Cynanchum radiatum, commonly known as the milkweed vine, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is a member of the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweed species, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that can be toxic, containing compounds like cardenolides, which are similar to those found in other milkweeds. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped, and the flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow with five petals. Cynanchum radiatum is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
