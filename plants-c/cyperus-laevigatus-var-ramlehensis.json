    "intro": "Cyperus laevigatus var. ramlehensis, commonly known as the Ramleh flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, lake margins, and along rivers. Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in non-native regions, impacting local ecosystems."
