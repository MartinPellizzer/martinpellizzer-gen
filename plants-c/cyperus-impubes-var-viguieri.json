    "intro": "Cyperus impubes var. viguieri, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along riverbanks or in flooded areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the Cyperaceae family."
