    "intro": "Cereus deflexispinus, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its segmented, branching stems that are typically ribbed and covered in small, sharp spines. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often during the holiday season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
