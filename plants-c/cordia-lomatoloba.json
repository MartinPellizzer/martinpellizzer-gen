    "intro": "Cordia lomatoloba, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Cordia lomatoloba is adapted to thrive in drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh desert environments."
