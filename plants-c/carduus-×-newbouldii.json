It is a perennial herb characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to the western United States. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
