    "intro": "Campyloneurum americanum, commonly known as the American groundhopper, is a small, creeping fern native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive, arching shape that gives it its scientific name. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in rows. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
