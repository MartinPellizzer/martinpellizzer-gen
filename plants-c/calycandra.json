    "intro": "Calycandra, commonly known as the \"butterfly plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its showy, butterfly-like flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically has palmate leaves with lobed segments, and its stems are often hairy or covered in fine pubescence. Calycandra species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. They are valued not only for their ornamental beauty but also for their traditional uses in local medicine and cultural practices."
