    "intro": "Carex acuta var. staminifera, commonly known as the staminiferous narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike of small, spikelet-bearing flowers, with the female flowers often outnumbering the male ones. This variant is distinguished by its staminiferous (stamen-bearing) flowers, which are a notable feature in its reproductive structure."
