It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring erect, branched stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a slightly serrated margin, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Campanula pseudolanceolata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or shaded meadows."
