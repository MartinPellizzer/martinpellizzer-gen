    "intro": "Clerodendrum sansibarense subsp. caesium, commonly known as the red-flowered clerodendrum, is a tropical shrub native to East Africa. It is characterized by its striking clusters of bright red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, emerging from the base of the bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface, contributing to its overall aesthetic appeal."
