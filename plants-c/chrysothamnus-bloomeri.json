    "intro": "Chrysothamnus bloomeri, commonly known as the bloomer's goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has aromatic, silvery-gray foliage that is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
