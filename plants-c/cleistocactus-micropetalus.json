    "intro": "Cleistocactus micropetalus, commonly known as the small-petalled closed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of short, spiny ribs. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the evening, a trait typical of many nocturnal flowering cacti. Its stems are typically green and succulent, adapted to store water in its native desert environment. Cleistocactus micropetalus is well-suited for cultivation in dry, well-draining soil and full sun."
