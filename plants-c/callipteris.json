    "intro": "Callipteris, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. They are low-growing, with narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Callipteris species are often used in coastal restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. Their small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences."
