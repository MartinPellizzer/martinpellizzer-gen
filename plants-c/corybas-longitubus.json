    "intro": "Corybas longitubus, commonly known as the long-tubed hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like floral structure that encloses the reproductive organs, a feature typical of the Corybas genus. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a long, tubular throat that is often brightly colored. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This orchid thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
