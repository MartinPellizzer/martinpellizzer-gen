    "intro": "Cyperus oxycarioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedgeland sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along waterways, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, a common feature among sedges. Cyperus oxycarioides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
