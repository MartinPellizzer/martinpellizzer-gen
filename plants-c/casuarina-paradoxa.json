    "intro": "Casuarina paradoxa, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a small evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, feathery foliage composed of tiny, scale-like leaves that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are followed by woody, cone-like fruits. Casuarina paradoxa is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often found in dunes and along the shoreline. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in coastal ecosystems."
