    "intro": "Cinchona chahuraguera, commonly known as the Huayna Picchu cinchona, is a species native to the Peruvian Andes. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its bark contains alkaloids, which have historically been used in the production of quinine. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
