    "intro": "Cousinia juzepczukii, commonly known as the Karakoram cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Karakoram Mountains. It forms dense, mat-like growths with tightly packed, woolly leaves that help insulate it against harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its fibrous roots anchor it firmly in rocky soils, and it is well adapted to cold, arid environments. Cousinia juzepczukii plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its mountainous habitat."
