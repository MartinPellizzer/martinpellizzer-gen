    "intro": "Cousinia decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a mat-forming habit, featuring a dense root system that helps it survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in fine hairs, which aid in water retention. Cousinia decumbens is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
