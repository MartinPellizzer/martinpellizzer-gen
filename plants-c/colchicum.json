    "intro": "Colchicum, commonly known as the meadow saffron, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Colchicaceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. They typically have basal leaves and produce toxic, bulb-like structures called corms. Colchicum species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas. The plant is notable for its medicinal and toxic properties, particularly due to the presence of colchicine, a compound used in medical treatments."
