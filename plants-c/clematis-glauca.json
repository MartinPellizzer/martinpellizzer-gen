    "intro": "Clematis glauca, commonly known as the blue clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It features slender, twining stems that can climb to heights of several meters. The plant produces clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy, blue-green sheen. Clematis glauca prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to gardens."
