    "intro": "Carpotroche mollis, commonly known as the silky broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish or greenish flowers in clusters, which are often inconspicuous and not showy. It is found in various regions of North America, often growing in open habitats such as prairies and woodlands. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants."
