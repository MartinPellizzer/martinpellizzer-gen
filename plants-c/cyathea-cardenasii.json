    "intro": "Cyathea cardenasii, commonly known as the Candelabra Tree Fern, is a species of tree fern native to Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil. Cyathea cardenasii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
