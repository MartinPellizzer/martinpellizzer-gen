    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 lathamii, commonly known as the Latham's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers with a large, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with a yellowish throat, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Cypripedium \u00d7 lathamii is valued for its ornamental beauty but is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
