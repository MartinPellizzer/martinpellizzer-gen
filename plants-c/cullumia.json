    "intro": "Cullumia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. These plants are typically low-growing shrubs or perennial herbs with narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to conserve water. Their flowers are usually showy, with bright colors such as yellow, orange, or red, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Cullumia species often thrive in rocky soils and can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing desert soils and providing food for local wildlife."
