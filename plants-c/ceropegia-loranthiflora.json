    "intro": "Ceropegia loranthiflora, commonly known as the sand mat or desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its trailing stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water. Ceropegia loranthiflora is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
