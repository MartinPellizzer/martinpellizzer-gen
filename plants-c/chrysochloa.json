It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow inflorescences. The plants typically grow in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. They are perennial herbs with slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Chrysochloa species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often used in landscaping due to their vibrant color and low maintenance requirements."
