It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant, showy bracts that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a unique texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Coleus dazo is typically grown as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens due to its sensitivity to direct sunlight."
