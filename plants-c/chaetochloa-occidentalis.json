    "intro": "Chaetochloa occidentalis, commonly known as western hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, saline environments, often found in tidal marshes and salt marshes. Its growth habit is rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. The species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
