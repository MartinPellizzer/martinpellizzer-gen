It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Carduus acanthoides and Carduus nutans, resulting in a plant with unique morphological traits. The species is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, purple to pinkish composite flower heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
