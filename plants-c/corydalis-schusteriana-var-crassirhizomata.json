    "intro": "Corydalis schusteriana var. crassirhizomata, commonly known as the thick-rooted corydalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It features slender, ascending stems with lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of delicate, spurred flowers in shades of pink and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is characterized by thick, fleshy rhizomes, which contribute to its hardiness and adaptability. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained, woodland soils."
