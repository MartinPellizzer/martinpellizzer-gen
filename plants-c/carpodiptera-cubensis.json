    "intro": "Carpodiptera cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban orchid bee, is a species of bee native to Cuba. It belongs to the family Apidae and is known for its role in pollination, particularly of orchids. The plant it interacts with, however, is not a plant but an animal, making it unique in its ecological role. It is characterized by its striking metallic blue coloration and is often seen visiting flowering plants for nectar. Despite its name, it does not have a direct botanical relationship with any specific plant species."
