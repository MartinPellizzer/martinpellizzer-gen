    "intro": "Calamagrostis nubila, commonly known as the cloud grass or silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery, silver-green foliage that gives it a distinctive, ethereal appearance. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Calamagrostis nubila is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
