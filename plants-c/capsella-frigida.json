It is a small annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Capsella frigida is known for its ability to survive in cooler climates and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
