    "intro": "Clematis montana var. brevifoliola, commonly known as the compact Clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features finely divided, ovate leaves that are smaller than those of the typical montana variety, giving it a more delicate appearance. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a compact, ornamental vine. Its vigorous growth habit requires support, such as trellises or fences, to showcase its beauty effectively."
