    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis proles dentata, commonly known as the toothed water-cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves, which are often toothed or serrated, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and damp woodlands. This species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves."
