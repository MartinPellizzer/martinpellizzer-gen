It features compound leaves with 10 to 20 pairs of lance-shaped leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces bright yellow, pendulous flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds. Cassia surattensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
