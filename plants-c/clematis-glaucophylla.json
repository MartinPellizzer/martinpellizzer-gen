    "intro": "Clematis glaucophylla, commonly known as the glaucous leaf clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Australia. It features compound leaves with a distinctive bluish-green hue, which gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue and purple during the spring and summer months. Its stems are twining and can reach lengths of up to 10 meters, making it an excellent choice for trellises or pergolas. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring regular pruning to maintain its shape and promote flowering."
