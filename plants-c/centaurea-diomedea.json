    "intro": "Centaurea diomedea, commonly known as the skyflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flower heads that resemble small, delicate crowns. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. Centaurea diomedea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its vibrant color and drought tolerance."
