It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces wind-pollinated flowers, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability."
