It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often clustered at the top of the stem. This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf pubescence, giving it a smooth, glabrous appearance."
