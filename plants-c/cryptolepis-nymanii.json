    "intro": "Cryptolepis nymanii, commonly known as African snake root, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its rough, often hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and orange-red berries that contain toxic compounds. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antimalarial and antiparasitic properties. However, due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with caution."
