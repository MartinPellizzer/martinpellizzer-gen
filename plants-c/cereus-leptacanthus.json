    "intro": "Cereus leptacanthus, commonly known as the slender-stemmed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that are typically fragrant. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. The plant is well-suited for cultivation in well-draining soil and full sunlight."
