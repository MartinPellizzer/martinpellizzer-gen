    "intro": "Cotyledon rupestris, commonly known as the rock cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring or summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its compact size and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
