    "intro": "Cyathea aspidiiformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in ideal conditions. Its rhizomes produce roots that anchor it to the soil, while its fronds are used for photosynthesis. Cyathea aspidiiformis is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
