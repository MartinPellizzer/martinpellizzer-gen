    "intro": "Cassia neglecta, commonly known as wild cassia, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features compound leaves with pairs of ovate to lanceolate leaflets, often with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellow, fragrant flowers arranged in spikes, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature to release the seeds. Cassia neglecta is often used in traditional medicine and can thrive in a variety of soil types with adequate sunlight."
