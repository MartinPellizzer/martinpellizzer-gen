    "intro": "Clathrotropis glaucophylla, commonly known as the white-leafed acacia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is a small tree or shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small yellow flowers are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, and it produces flat, leathery pods that contain seeds. Clathrotropis glaucophylla is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
