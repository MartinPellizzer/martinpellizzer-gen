    "intro": "Cephalanthera caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its dark green, grass-like leaves and a dense, spiral arrangement of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest edges. Cephalanthera caucasica is a protected species due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity."
