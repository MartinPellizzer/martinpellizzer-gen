    "intro": "Cereus procumbens, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that grow close to the ground. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night and close by morning. These flowers are typically borne at the ends of the stems and are adapted for pollination by nocturnal insects. Cereus procumbens is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight."
