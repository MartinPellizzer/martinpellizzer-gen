    "intro": "Cayratia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone vine, is a climbing plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, clustered greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets. Cayratia calcicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky and degraded landscapes."
