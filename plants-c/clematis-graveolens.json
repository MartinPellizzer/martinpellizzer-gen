It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically blue or purple, with a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing along fences or trellises. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
