    "intro": "Carpinus, commonly known as hornbeam, is a genus of deciduous trees and shrubs belonging to the family Betulaceae. These plants are characterized by their dense, rounded crowns and small, ovate leaves that often turn yellow in the fall. The bark of Carpinus species is typically smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. Their flowers are inconspicuous, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and they produce small, winged fruits called samaras. Carpinus species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
