    "intro": "Cyathocalyx cauliflorus, commonly known as the tropical hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, single flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, yellow, or white. The plant has a short, woody stem and produces leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are borne on the branches rather than the tips, a feature known as cauliflorous growth. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well adapted to warm, humid climates."
