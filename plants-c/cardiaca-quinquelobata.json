    "intro": "Cardiaca quinquelobata, commonly known as the five-lobed heartleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are distinctly divided into five lobes, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Cardiaca quinquelobata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
