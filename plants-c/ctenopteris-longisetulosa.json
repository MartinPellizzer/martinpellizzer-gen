    "intro": "Ctenopteris longisetulosa, commonly known as the long-awned sea palm, is a species of marine fern that thrives in shallow coastal waters. It is characterized by its branching fronds that resemble the structure of a palm tree, although it is not a true palm. The plant has a unique ability to tolerate brackish and saltwater environments, making it a common sight in tidal zones. Its fronds are covered in fine, hair-like structures that aid in reducing water loss and providing stability in dynamic coastal conditions. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sediment and providing habitat for small marine organisms."
