It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and turn vibrant yellow in the fall, adding ornamental value to the landscape."
