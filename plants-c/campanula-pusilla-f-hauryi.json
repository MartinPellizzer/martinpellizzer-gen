    "intro": "Campanula pusilla f. hauryi, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
