    "intro": "Colymbada rupestris, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to rocky and arid regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Colymbada rupestris is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
