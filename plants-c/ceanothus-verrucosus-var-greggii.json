    "intro": "Ceanothus verrucosus var. greggii, commonly known as Gregg's ceanothus, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its blue-gray foliage and clusters of showy, sky-blue to lavender flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps reduce water loss. Gregg's ceanothus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
