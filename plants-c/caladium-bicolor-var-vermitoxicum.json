    "intro": "Caladium bicolor var. vermitoxicum, commonly known as the toxic leaf caladium, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that come in shades of red, orange, and white, often with contrasting patterns. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, as it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Despite its beauty, it contains toxic compounds, making it unsuitable for consumption or handling without proper precautions."
