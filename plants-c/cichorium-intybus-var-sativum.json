    "intro": "Cichorium intybus var. sativum, commonly known as chicory, is a biennial or annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright stem, spoon-shaped leaves, and blue or purple flower heads that bloom in the summer. The plant is cultivated for its edible leaves, which can be used raw in salads or cooked, and for its root, which is used to make coffee substitutes. Chicory is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in ecological gardening. Its botanical features make it a versatile and hardy plant with both ornamental and culinary uses."
