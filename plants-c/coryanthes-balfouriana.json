    "intro": "Coryanthes balfouriana, commonly known as the Balfour's hooded orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, hooded flower structure that resembles a small umbrella, with a prominent spur at the base. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers are predominantly greenish-yellow with red and orange markings, which help attract specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
