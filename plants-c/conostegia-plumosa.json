    "intro": "Conostegia plumosa, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southern United States. It features soft, silver-gray foliage with a velvety texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a delicate floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens."
