    "intro": "Cotoneaster angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, compact growth with small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
