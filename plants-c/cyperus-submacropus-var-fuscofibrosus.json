    "intro": "Cyperus submacropus var. fuscofibrosus, commonly known as the black-haired flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in dense clusters at the base of the plant. Its roots are fibrous, and it often grows in wet or marshy habitats, making it a common species in wetland ecosystems. The variety fuscofibrosus is distinguished by its dark brown, fibrous appearance, which sets it apart from other varieties of Cyperus submacropus."
