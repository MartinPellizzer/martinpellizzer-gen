    "intro": "Caesalpinia cucullata, commonly known as the helmet tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring a thick, flaky bark and dense, rounded foliage. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the dry season. Its fruit is a long, slender pod that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Caesalpinia cucullata is also valued for its hard, durable wood and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
