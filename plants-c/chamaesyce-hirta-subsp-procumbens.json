    "intro": "Chamaesyce hirta subsp. procumbens, commonly known as the hairy prostrate purslane, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features prostrate or ascending stems that are densely covered with glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The leaves are fleshy, opposite, and often have a reddish or purple tinge, especially when exposed to full sun. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This species is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry, open habitats."
