    "intro": "Cassia viscida, commonly known as the sticky cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a sticky resin, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Cassia viscida is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
