    "intro": "Connarus trifoliatus, commonly known as the three-leaf connarus, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in folk medicine for their purported healing properties. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
