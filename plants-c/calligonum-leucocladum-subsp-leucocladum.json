    "intro": "Calligonum leucocladum subsp. leucocladum, commonly known as the white-flowered tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in desert and coastal habitats. Due to its hardiness, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
