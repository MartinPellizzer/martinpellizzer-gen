    "intro": "Colchicum jankae, commonly known as the Janka's meadow saffron, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Colchicaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fiery red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a bulbous corm, which serves as its primary storage organ and enables it to survive in harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically appearing after the flowers have bloomed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Colchicum jankae is considered a rare and endangered species."
