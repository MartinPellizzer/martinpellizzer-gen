    "intro": "Cotyledon neglecta, commonly known as the \"Lamb's Ear\" plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Cotyledon neglecta is well-suited for rock gardens or containers due to its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements."
