    "intro": "Crataegus globosa, commonly known as the globeflower, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its round, red or orange berries that resemble small globes, hence its common name. The plant produces small white or pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Crataegus globosa is often found in woodland edges and stream banks, contributing to local biodiversity."
