    "intro": "Cardamine finitima f. lilacina, commonly known as the lilac-flowered water-crowfoot, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves that are typically submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces delicate, lilac-colored flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a subtle aesthetic to freshwater habitats. It thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in streams and ponds. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
