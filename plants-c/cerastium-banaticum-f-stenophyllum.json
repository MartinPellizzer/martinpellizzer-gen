    "intro": "Cerastium banaticum f. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and hairy, narrow leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its foliage is often covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss and protects against herbivory. The species is noted for its compact growth habit and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
