    "intro": "Chaetothylax, commonly known as the spikeless lily, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which typically features showy, often fragrant flowers with elongated petals. The plants are native to Southeast Asia and are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Chaetothylax species usually have a short, stocky rhizome and produce small, clustered inflorescences. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in horticulture, though they are relatively rare in the wild."
