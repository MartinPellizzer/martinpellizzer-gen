    "intro": "Cacalia hieronymi, commonly known as the Hieronymus' bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Cacalia hieronymi is often found in rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy and resilient species."
