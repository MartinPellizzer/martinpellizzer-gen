It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
